Festuca arundinacea (syn., Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) is a species of grass commonly known as tall fescue. It is a cool-season perennial C3 species of bunchgrass native to Europe. It is an important forage grass throughout Europe, and many cultivars have been used in agriculture. It is also an ornamental grass in gardens, and a phytoremediation plant.

The predominant cultivar found in British pastures is S170, an endophyte-free variety.[1] In its native European environment, tall fescue is found in damp grasslands, river banks, and in coastal seashore locations.[2] Its distribution is a factor of climatic, edaphic, or other environmental attributes.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_oleifera

Camellia oleifera, which originated in China, is notable as an important source of edible oil (known as tea oil or camellia oil) obtained from its seeds.[2] It is commonly known as the oil-seed camellia or tea oil camellia, though to a lesser extent other species of camellia are used in oil production too.

It is widely distributed in China and is cultivated extensively there. It is found in forests, thickets, banks of streams and foothills at elevations of 500 to 1,300 metres.[3]

This species looks much similar to Camellia sasanqua except the dark green, evergreen leaves are a bit larger, three to five inches long and two to three inches wide. Single, white, fragrant flowers are produced in mid to late fall, and this large shrub or small tree will reach a height of 20 feet with thin, upright, multiple trunks and branches. The crown forms a rounded or oval vase with lower branches removed.[4]

Uses
Main article: Tea seed oil
The seeds of Camellia oleifera can be pressed to yield tea seed oil, a sweetish seasoning and cooking oil. In tea seed oil, oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid comprises ~80% of the total fatty acid content - the oil is similar in composition to olive oil.

Tea oil is also known as "Tea Seed Oil" when sold as cooking oil in supermarkets throughout Australia, New Zealand and the United States.[5]

It can also be used in textile manufacture, soap making and as an illuminant.[3] Camellia oil is also traditionally used to protect Japanese woodworking tools and cutlery from corrosion and is currently sold for that purpose.[6][7]
