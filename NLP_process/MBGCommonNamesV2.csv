Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best flowering in full sun. Prefers moist, organically rich soils which drain well. Somewhat evergreen in the South, but generally deciduous in the St. Louis area where stems may suffer substantial damage (including dying to the ground) in cold winters. Significant stem damage can be expected when winter temperatures approach zero degrees F. Best sited in a protected location in the St. Louis area. Blooms on new wood, so prune as needed (e.g., remove stems lost to winter and, if desired, thin to the ground up to 1/3 of old stems) in late winter to early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abelia × grandiflora is a cross between A. chinensis and A. uniflora. It is a rounded, spreading, multi-stemmed shrub in the honeysuckle family. Typically grows on gracefully arching branches to 2-4' tall in the St. Louis area, but usually taller (to 6' tall ) in the warm winter climates of the South (USDA Zones 8-9). In years where the stems die to the ground in winter but the plant survives, flowering will still occur, but on smaller plants that typically reach a height of only 1-1.5'. Features clusters of white-tinged-pink, bell-shaped flowers (to 3/4"" long) which appear in the upper leaf axils and stem ends over a long and continuous late spring to fall bloom period. Flowers are fragrant. Ovate, glossy, dark green leaves (to 1.25"" long) turn purplish-bronze in autumn.Genus name honors Dr. Clarke Abel (1780-1826), physician and naturalist, who collected seed and plants as part of a British expedition to China in 1817.Specific epithet means large flowered.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Winter die-back may occur in the St. Louis area.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen or grouping or mass for shrub borders or foundations. Also effective as an informal hedge or low screen (plants tend to lose attractive graceful shape if pruned or sheared to a more formal hedge look) in southern areas where winter kill is not a concern.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in sandy loams.  May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range.  New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist.  Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Avoid hot and dry sites.  Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge.  Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter.  Spring or summer pruning often  results in significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching.  Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes.  Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April).  The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance.  Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs.  Samaras ripen in September-October.  Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze.  Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.
","
Problems
Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots.  Potential insect pests include  aphids, scale, borers, bagworms, and root weevils.  Mites may be troublesome.  Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late spring frosts.  Chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.

Foliage appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Can be grown from seed, and may flower as early as the second or third year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus pavia, commonly called red buckeye, is a deciduous clump-forming shrub or small tree with an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows 10-20’ tall. Showy, erect, 4-10” long panicles of red to orange-red, narrow-tubular flowers appear in spring. Palmately compound, shiny, dark green leaves are attractive in spring and early summer, but usually begin to decline by August. Smooth, light brown, globular (1-2” diameter) seed capsules encase 1-3 shiny seeds called buckeyes that ripen in the fall. Seeds are poisonous and are avoided by most wildlife. Fall foliage color is unremarkable. Red buckeye is native to southeastern Missouri where it typically occurs in low rich wooded valleys, at bluff bases, on wooded slopes and along streams (Steyermark). Flowers are attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds and bloom in St. Louis at about the same time that the hummingbirds return to the area in spring migration.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet honors 17th century Dutch botanist Peter Paaw (Petrus Pavius).

Easily grown in dry, very well-draining soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers some light shade if grown outdoors in a climate with hot summers. As a houseplant, this succulent requires as much bright light as possible. Tolerates some drought once established. Reduce watering during the winter. A relatively vigorous grower and easily propagated from offsets. Hardy in Zones 7-11.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aloe aristata, commonly called torch plant or lace aloe, is a low-growing, evergreen, rosette-forming succulent native to a range of habitats in southern Africa. These include the dry sands of the Karoo region and cool, rocky slopes in Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal. Lace aloe is often found growing in clumps of ten or more rosettes, forming a low mound up to 2' wide. The rosettes can reach up to 8"" in diameter and are made up of dark, grey-green, triangle shaped foliage (up to 6"" long) with small white spots and fine, white hairs along their margins. In summer, flowering stalks (up to 15"" tall) appear from mature rosettes bearing a cluster of tubular, pendulous, coral-orange blooms.Genus name comes from the Arabic name of these perennial succulents.The specific epithet aristata means ""bearing bristles or a beard"", and refers to the fine, white hairs found on the leaf margins of this species.
","
Problems
Avoid overhead watering, as this can lead to rotting within the rosettes. Constantly wet or poorly draining soils can also lead to rot. Watch for mealy bugs and scale, particularly when grown indoors.

Above ground stems are not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they may die to the ground in severe winters (roots are usually hardy therein and will sprout new growth the following spring).  In St. Louis, it is best to plant this vine in a protected location and apply a winter mulch.  Established plants may send up root suckers which should be removed if spread is not desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bignonia capreolata, known as cross-vine, is a vigorous, woody vine that climbs by branched tendrils with adhesive disks.  It is grown primarily for its attractive flowers and its ability to rapidly cover structures with attractive foliage.  Opposite, compound leaves are bifoliate.  Each leaf consists of a pair of lanceolate to oblong dark green leaflets (to 6” long) and a branched tendril between them.  Tendril branches terminate in adhesive disks that easily attach to walls.  Foliage remains evergreen in the South, but turns reddish-purple in fall with subsequent leaf drop in the colder winter areas of its range.  Axillary clusters (2-5 flowered cymes) of fragrant, trumpet-shaped, orange-red flowers (to 2” long) appear in spring.  Flowers are followed by greenish, pod-like seed capsules (to 7” long) which mature in late summer and persist into fall.  

This vine is in the same family as and closely related to Campsis radicans which is commonly known as trumpet vine.Genus name honors of Abbe Jean Paul Bignon (1662-1743), Librarian to Louis XIV.Specific epithet means having tendrils.A cross section of stem reveals a marking resembling the Greek cross, hence the common name.

Avoid frequent watering.  Plants are intolerant of lots of moisture, and generally do not perform well in areas with high rainfall.  When grown as a turfgrass for lawns, mowing is infrequently required.  When needed, mow to a height of 2-3” tall.  Also may be naturalized without mowing as a 4-6” tall grass. Plant seed in April-June.  May also be established by sod or plugs.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buchloe dactyloides, known as buffalo grass, is a dioecious, drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, fine-textured, warm season perennial grass that is native primarily to the Great Plains within the area from Minnesota to Montana south to Louisiana and Arizona.  It is one of the dominant grasses of the shortgrass prairie. It is commonly called buffalo grass because it was at one time regularly grazed by herds of buffalo (American bison) that once populated the Great Plains.  It typically grows 4-8” tall  with gray-green curly leaves.  It spreads by stolons.  Somewhat inconspicuous green flowers bloom in summer (June -August), with male flowers appearing in comb-like spikes on slender stems rising above the leaves and with female flowers appearing in bur-like clusters on short stems hidden by the leaves.  Buffalo grass is considered to be an excellent native forage grass.  With the addition of new cultivars, buffalo grass is now becoming more popular as a low-maintenance turfgrass for lawns, parks, golf courses, roadsides and commercial areas.  In optimum growing conditions, it can form a low maintenance turf which survives hot and humid summers with minimal water and fertilizer.  The main disadvantages of buffalo grass as a lawn turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to mid-spring when grass is dormant, (2) invasive habit which may result in stoloniferous spread into adjacent plantings, and (3) intolerance of heavy foot traffic.Specific epithet means resembling fingers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Chinch bug can be troublesome.  Brown patch, summer patch and leaf spot may occur.  Stolons may spread into adjacent areas.
","
Garden Uses
Low-maintenance turfgrass for lawns, parks, golf courses, commercial areas and roadsides.  Effective on dry sunny slopes where it can also provide some erosion control.

Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions including poor, somewhat dry soils, but is intolerant of wet conditions. Winter hardy to USDA Zone 5 where it usually does not suffer any significant winter die-back. Unlike Buddleja davidii, this species blooms on the previous year's wood, so cutting plants to the ground in late winter each year is not an option. Prune in late spring immediately after flowering. Weeping habit may be best showcased by training and growing this plant as a single trunk tree.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buddleja alternifolia is a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub or small single trunk tree which typically grows 8-15' tall (infrequently to 20' as a tree) with arching, drooping, willow-like branches. Tree form may superficially resemble a small weeping willow. Short clusters (to 3/4"" long) of lightly fragrant, lilac-purple flowers bloom in the leaf axils along the previous year's stems in spring. Flowers earlier than most other species of butterfly bush. Lance-shaped leaves (to 4"" long) are green above and grayish below. Unlike other cultivated species of Buddleja, this species has alternate leaves, hence the species and common names. Also sometimes commonly called fountain buddleia in reference to the growing habit. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.

The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia.  However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet refers to the alternate leaves of the species.Common name also refers to the alternate leaves of the species.

Culture
Easily grown in evenly moist, well-drained sandy loams in full sun to part shade.  Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun.  Plants can grow in close to full shade, but typically are less vigorous and more open with decreased foliage density.  When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to scorch, bronze in winter or suffer from mite attacks.  Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.  Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing.  Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date.  Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost.  Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots.  Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2”).  Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation.  Boxwood is best sited in locations sheltered from strong winds, with, if possible, some protection from full winter sun.  Foliage may bronze in winter when exposed to half day to full day sun.  Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing.  Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus balearica, commonly known as Balearic boxwood, Spanish boxwood or Giant boxwood, is a rounded to broad-rounded shrub which typically grows in cultivation to 6-12’ tall, but in the wild, may grow as a small tree to as much as 25’ tall.  It is native to sandy soils and rocky slopes in the Mediterranean region from Spain and France to Turkey and Algeria, including of course the Balearic Islands (autonomous division of Spain) in the northeast Mediterranean (largest island being Mallorca).  

Elliptic, simple, opposite, smooth-margined, glossy, evergreen leaves (each to 1 3/4” long) are dark green above and pale green beneath.  Tiny, apetulous, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in April-May in axillary clusters.  Fruit is a globose dehiscent capsule.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Specific epithet is in reference to the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean east of Spain in reference to one of its native territories.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood to make boxes.  Another theory on common name is that boxwood describes the quadrangular (square box cross section) stems of young plants.
","
Problems
Boxwood can be somewhat temperamental to grow in the St. Louis area where its evergreen foliage tends to bronze (turn unattractive brownish-yellow) in harsh winters, particularly if plants are located in open areas exposed to full sun and winter winds.  Otherwise, boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning.  No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot.  Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils.  The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid.  In the deep South, nematodes are of concern.  New growth is particularly susceptible to winter damage.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, humusy, organically rich, acidic soils in part shade or filtered sun. Does well in bright shade. Avoid direct sun where leaves will scorch. Tubers may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, however, tubers should be started indoors in early spring, planted outside directly in the ground or in containers after threat of frost has past, dug up in fall immediately after foliage die back/first frost and then overwintered in a dry location (set in dry peat or wood shavings) where temperatures do not dip below 45 degrees F, in somewhat the same manner as done for tuberous begonias. Container plants may be stored indoors in the containers. When growing plants in garden soils, provide regular moisture, especially during dry summer periods, and do not allow soils to dry out. Plants also appreciate regular fertilization. St. Louis summer temperatures are ideal for caladiums: hot and humid with nighttime temperatures rarely dipping below 60 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caladium bicolor, commonly called caladiums or angel wings, are arum family members that are grown exclusively for their bold and colorful foliage. Calla-type flowers, if present, are usually hidden. Plants typically grow in clumps to 1-2.5' tall. Arrowhead-shaped leaves (to 1.5' long) are various shades of green mottled and blotched with pink, red, white or combinations thereof often with distinctively colored veins. Synonymous with C. x hortulanum.Genus name comes from the Latinized Malay plant-name kaladi.Specific epithet means of two colors.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaves are rather fragile and may easily be damaged by wind or hail. Slugs and snails may chew holes in the foliage.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it forms a rhizomatous spreading ground cover.  North of Zone 8, it will not survive winter but may be grown as an annual.  It is easily grown in a wide range of medium moisture soils in part shade to full shade.  Best performance occurs in soils with regular moisture, but plants tolerate both periods of drought as well as moist to wet conditions.  Plants also tolerate full sun in native areas along the West coast.  Plants will spread by rhizomes and self-seeding to form a ground cover.  Propagate by seed or division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex tumulicola, sometimes commonly called foothill sedge or Berkeley sedge, is an evergreen perennial sedge that grows in arching clumps to 1-2' tall.  It is native to open woods, meadows and coastal prairies from the central coast of California north to Oregon and Washington.  Plants feature pubescent, narrow, grass-like, medium green leaves (to 18"" long and 1/8"" wide).   Brown, non-showy flowers bloom in spring atop stems rising above the foliage to 2' tall.  

Carex divulsa is a European species of Carex which at one point was sold in California by mistake as Carex tumulicola.  It differs inter alia from the California native by being a more aggressive spreader with winter hardiness to USDA Zone 4.

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this evergreen sedge will form an impressive ground cover which is not only ornamentally attractive but also helps stabilize soils and control erosion.  Flowers are somewhat insignificant.  Group or mass.  Also effective accent for borders or smaller gardens.  Can be mowed and used as a lawn substitute, particularly for difficult areas of the landscape.  True beauty of this sedge is in its evergreen foliage.  Birds are attracted to the plant's seed.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cercis canadensis, commonly called eastern redbud, is a deciduous, often multi-trunked understory tree with a rounded crown that typically matures to 20-30’ tall with a slightly larger spread.  It is particularly noted for its stunning pea-like rose-purple flowers which bloom profusely on bare branches in early spring (March-April) before the foliage emerges.  This tree is native to eastern and central North America from Connecticut to New York to southern Ontario and the Great Lakes south to Western Texas and Florida.  It is found in open woodlands, thickets, woodland margins, limestone glades and along rocky streams and bluffs throughout Missouri (Steyermark).  Flowers (to ½” wide) bloom in clusters of 4-10.  Flowers are followed by flattened leguminous bean-like dry seedpods (to 2-4” long) that mature to brown in summer. Each pod has 6-12 seeds.  Pods may remain on the tree into winter.  Alternate, simple, cordate, broadly ovate to nearly orbicular, dull green to blue-green leaves (3-5” across) have a papery texture and are short pointed at the tip.  Leaves turn pale yellow to greenish-yellow in fall.  Cercis canadensis is the state tree of Oklahoma.Genus name comes from the Greek word kerkis meaning weaver’s shuttle in reference to the resemblance of each seed pod to a weaver’s shuttle.Specific epithet is in reference to Canada (southern Ontario) being part of the native range of this tree.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chilopsis linearis, commonly called desert willow, is a small deciduous tree or large shrub with a single trunk, upright, open branching structure, and vigorous growth habit. This plant is found growing in desert stream banks, washes, ditches, and depressions throughout the southwestern United States and north-central Mexico. Mature plants will reach up to 30' tall with a 20' spread. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, reaching up to 10"" long and only 0.25"" wide. White to rose-pink blooms (up to 1.5"" long) with ruffled petals appear on terminal panicles from May to June, but will sporadically rebloom throughout the summer particularly after rain. The fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers are highly attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other insect pollinators.Genus name comes from the Greek words cheilos meaning lip and opsis meaning resembling in reference to the distinct lip found on its calyx.The specific epithet linearis means ""linear"" and refers to the shape of the foliage.The common name desert willow refers to the resemblance of this plant to many willows (genus Salix), but it is more closely related to catalpa (genus Catalpa) and trumpetcreeper (genus Campsis).LUCRETIA HAMILTON is a compact selection that reaches a maximum height and spread of around 18'. The blooms are a bright fuchsia with light pink to white interiors. Its name honors Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton (1908-1986), an American botanist and botanical illustrator whose work focused primarily on the flora of the southwestern United States.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small citrus tree will grow well in sandy, neutral, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. It has the best winter hardiness of any of the lemon-type fruits. Best performance occurs in full sun. Provide consistent and regular watering. Avoid wet poorly drained soils. When grown outside, this tree will bear fruit year around in warm temperatures, however it may slip into dormancy if winter temperatures dip significantly below 55F. It will tolerate brief temperatures around 32 F., but generally does not tolerate frost. This plant thrives in climates where daily temperatures range from low 70s F. in the daytime to high 50s F. at night. Elsewhere it may be grown in containers as a houseplant. Use an all purpose potting mix. Set container outdoors in late spring in full sun in a location protected from wind. Bring pot indoors in fall for overwintering in a bright sunny southern window. Mist plants with water almost daily in winter. Indoor plants usually fruit in spring. Hand pollination may be needed for indoor plants due to the lack of insects. New plants may be easily grown from cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus, x meyeri, commonly called Meyer’s lemon, is native to China. It was introduced into the U.S. by Frank Meyer who reportedly found the plant in 1908 near Peking, China. It is believed to be a hybrid cross of Citrus limon (lemon) and Citrus reticulata (mandarin orange). It is less acidic, juicier and sweeter than common lemons. Trees typically grow to 6-10’ tall. Shiny dark green leaves are evergreen. Waxy, fragrant, white flowers appear year around in warm climates. Large rounded yellow fruit (to 3” diameter) with smooth, thin skin lacks the rough texture and pronounced nipple of the true lemon. Original Meyer lemon trees were symptomless carriers of a virus (tristeza) that killed other citrus family trees. Those original trees were mostly destroyed and replaced with a virus-free variety that today is referred to as improved Meyer lemon. Not much commercial growth of this fruit is done because the fruits are thin skinned and ship poorly.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet honors Frank Meyer.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Plants tolerate humidity and some dry conditions, but are not as drought tolerant as some other species of Coreopsis. Prompt deadheading of spent flower stalks can be tedious for a large planting, but does tend to encourage additional bloom. Plants may be sheared in mid summer to promote a fall rebloom and to remove any sprawling or unkempt foliage. In optimum growing conditions, this stoloniferous perennial will slowly spread in the garden over time to form an attractive planting, but spread is easy to check. Clumps may be divided in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis auriculata, commonly called lobed tickseed or mouse ear coreopsis, is a stoloniferous, short-lived, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in a dense, bushy, slowly-spreading clump to 12-18” tall.  It is native to open woods in the southeastern U.S. from Virginia to Florida and Mississippi.  Mostly basal, hairy, petioled, ovate to elliptic leaves (to 3” long) are deep green.  Each leaf has a distinctive pair of small lateral lobes at the base of the blade which resemble the shape of mouse ears, hence the sometimes used common name of mouse ear coreopsis for this plant.  Daisy-like flowers (to 2” wide) have 8 yellow rays (each having a three-lobed apex) surrounding a yellow center disk.  Flowers bloom primarily from April to June atop upright flower stalks rising 18” tall.   A sparse and intermittent rebloom may continue throughout the summer into fall if spent flowers are regularly deadheaded.  In hot summer climates like the St. Louis area, plants usually stop blooming in mid-summer with a small rebloom sometimes occurring in fall after temperatures moderate.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning bug and opsis meaning like in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet comes from the Latin ariculatus meaning having an ear-like appendage in obvious reference to the ear-like lobes at the base of each leaf.‘Nana’ is a dwarf selection that typically grows to 6-9” tall.  Excellent for border fronts and edging.  It will not come true from seed and should be propagated by division or cuttings.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Tends to sprawl if grown in moist and/or fertile soils. Crown rot may occur if grown in moist, poorly drained soils. Foliage decline in hot summer climates may occur if soils are allowed to dry out.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis lanceolata, commonly called lanceleaf coreopsis, is a Missouri native wildflower which typically grows to 2' tall and occurs in prairies, glades, fields and roadsides primarily in the Ozark region of the State. Features solitary, yellow, daisy-like flowers (1-2"" diameter) with eight yellow rays (toothed at the tips) and flat yellow center disks. Flowers bloom atop slender, erect stems from spring to early summer. Narrow, hairy, lance-shaped leaves (2-6"" long) appear primarily near the base of the plant in basal tufts. Lower basal leaves are mostly entire, while smaller stem leaves may be pinnately lobed. Plants in the genus Coreopsis are sometimes commonly called lanceleaf tickseed in reference to the resemblance of the seeds to ticks. Many excellent cultivars of this species are available in commerce.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning bug and opsis meaning like in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet means lance-shaped.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Light afternoon shade helps avoid possible sun scald in hot summer climates. Best growth occurs in cool and dry summer climates. Plants dislike areas with high humidity and frequent rain. Seeds may be planted directly in garden soil after the last spring frost date. They may also be planted in pots. Plants grow rapidly (pinching off young leaves can begin in 30 days). Snip off flower stems before flowering to prolong harvest of leaves. Plant new seed every 2 weeks to insure a continuous crop of leaves. Allow some plants to flower and seed if harvest of coriander seed is desired. Seeds are ready for harvest in 90 days. Plants tend to bolt easily (abandon leaf growth, flower, seed and die) in hot summer climates. A late summer planting of seed can be done for fall harvest of leaves but seed will not mature before frost. Plants are annuals but have naturalized in some parts of North America.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Coriandrum sativum is a warm weather annual that is commonly grown in herb gardens for its lacy, strong-scented foliage (cilantro) and its aromatic seeds (coriander). It is native to southern Europe and the western Mediterranean. It typically grows in a basal clump to 24"" tall and to 18"" wide. Plants may sprawl in the garden. Finely-divided upper leaves are fern-like. Broad-lobed lower leaves resemble those of Italian parsley. Cilantro leaves are used for flavoring a number of food dishes including salads, salsas, meats, sauces and soups. Leaves are best used fresh, but may be frozen in ice cube trays for later use. Stems are also edible when young. Coriander seeds ripen in round, yellow-brown pods. Seeds are typically ready for harvest about 90 days after seed is planted (late summer to early autumn in St. Louis). Mature seeds have a pleasantly sweet-spicy fragrance and are used for flavoring sauces, meats, sausages, stews, chutneys, pies and cakes. Seeds are an ingredient found in curry powder. By contrast, young seeds are never used for culinary purposes because they have an unpleasant fragrance and bitter taste. White to pink to pale lavender flowers bloom above the foliage clump in loose compound umbels (to 2"" across). Swallowtail butterflies feed on plant leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek name koriandron from koris referring to the unpleasant smell of the unripe fruits which disappears when they are ripe and dry.Specific epithet means cultivated.
","
Problems

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia galanga, commonly known as Siamese ginger, Thai ginger or galangal, is a tropical evergreen perennial with a thick aromatic rhizome.  It is native to Southeast Asia.  For culinary use, the rhizome is typically cut up into small pieces, thin-sliced, pounded into a paste, or dried and powdered for inclusion as a flavoring in a variety of food dishes such as soups and curries.  It is reportedly one of the most frequently used spices in Thai cooking, and is also quite popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.  Indonesian rendang is usually flavored with this rhizome.  Each plant typically grows to 6' tall in a clump of stalks clad with long green leaves (12-15"" long by 2-3"" wide).  Showy yellowish-white flowers with red centers bloom throughout the year on upright inflorescences.  Flowers are followed by red fruits (1/2"" diameter) which emerge green and then turn yellow before finally maturing to red.  Leaves, stalks, rhizomes and seeds all have a mild aromatic aroma.  Foliage is attractive and plants may be grown ornamentally without harvesting the rhizome.  Plants are evergreen when grown in frost-free locations.  In Southern Asia, fresh rhizomes are commonly sold in markets.  Rhizomes also have certain folk medicinal uses in Asia.  In the U.S., rhizomes are generally available for purchase in most Asian groceries.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Languas galanga.Genus name honors Italian botanist Prospero Alpino (1553-1616).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cotinus obovatus, commonly called American smoketree, is a small, deciduous, rounded, Missouri native tree or large, upright shrub typically growing 20-30' tall and occurring on limestone glades, rocky limestone bluffs and bald knobs in the area of the White River in southeast Missouri. Smoketree gets its common name not from the 6-10"" flower clusters (tiny, insignificant, dioecious, yellowish-green flowers) which bloom in June, but from the billowy hairs (attached to elongated stalks on the spent flower clusters) which turn a smoky pink to purplish pink in summer, thus covering the tree with fluffy, hazy, smoke-like puffs. Bluish green leaves are, as the species name suggests, obovate. Foliage turns a variety of colors in the fall (including yellow, red, orange and reddish purple), and produces some of the best fall color of any of the native American trees and shrubs.Genus name comes from the Greek word kotinus meaning olive.Specific epithet means egg-shaped with the broadest end uppermost.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates heat, drought and a wide range of soils. When grown as a turfgrass, mow regularly to a height of 3/4"" to 1.5"" tall, fertilize during the growing season (May to August) and use soil barriers to prevent spread into adjacent areas. Sometimes overseeded with rye. Bermuda grass has winter hardiness problems in the Midwest Transition Area, however, and is not recommended as a turfgrass for St. Louis. Some winter kill is to be expected when winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F. Needs regular dethatching. It is not recommended as a turfgrass for lawns in the St. Louis area.'Sundevil' is considered even less winter hardy than the species.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynodon dactylon, commonly called Bermuda grass or wire grass, is a tough, warm season grass which spreads rapidly by both stolons and rhizomes. In optimum conditions, it will form a dense lawn which tolerates foot traffic well and excludes many common weeds. On the other hand, many homeowners consider it to be a noxious weed and expend considerable energy trying to eradicate it from their lawns and garden areas. The main disadvantages of Bermuda grass as a turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to late spring when grass goes dormant and (2) highly aggressive habit which results in spread into adjacent plantings such as flower beds, vegetable garden and borders.Genus name comes from the Greek words kyon meaning a dog and odous meaning a tooth.'Sundevil' is a coarse, seeded turfgrass variety which features light green blades.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. White grubs are the most common insect problem. Additional insects of concern include sod webworms, cutworms, armyworms, nematodes and mole crickets. Watch for mites. Brown patch and dollar spot are infrequent disease problems. Reportedly has good resistance to spring dead spot disease. Bermuda grass can spread invasively in the landscape.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Echinacea paradoxa, sometimes called yellow coneflower, is the only species in the genus Echinacea to have yellow flowers instead of the usual purple flowers (this being the paradox suggested by the species name). It primarily occurs on glades and prairies in the Ozark regions of Missouri and Arkansas. Features large, daisy-like flowers with drooping yellow to orange-yellow petals (ray flowers) and very large, coppery-brown to chocolate-brown central cones. Best flower display is mid-June to mid-July, sometimes with sporadic continued bloom throughout the summer. Flowers grow on rigid, glabrous stems typically to 3' tall. Smooth, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (4-8"" long) with linear veining. The dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter and, if flower heads are not removed, are often visited by goldfinches who perch on or just below the blackened cones to feed on the seeds. he Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog in reference to the spiny center cone.Genus name of Echinacea comes from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet calls attention to the paradox of why this species of Echinacea has yellow flowers instead of the usual purple.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Echinacea is a genus of seven species all endemic to eastern and central North America. Coneflowers bloom from June to August with some sporadic later bloom. Good fresh cut or dried flower. The dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter, and if flower heads are not removed, the blackened cones may be visited by goldfinches or other birds that feed on the seeds.Genus name of Echinacea comes from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.BUBBLE GUM is a double coneflower in the DOUBLE SCOOP series of Echinacea cultivars from Ball Horticultural.  It is the result of a 2006 cross-pollination of two proprietary Echinacea hybrid selections which occurred in a controlled breeding program conducted in Elburn, Illinois in 2006.  U.S. Plant Patent PP23,103 was issued on October 9, 2012 under the cultivar name of 'Balscblum'.  This is an upright, free-branching, columnar coneflower that typically grows in a clump to 24-28” tall and to 18-20"" wide on sturdy stems that do not need staking.  It is noted for its large, composite, slightly-fragrant, bubble gum pink double coneflowers (each to 4” diameter) featuring overlapping, slightly reflexed, deep pink rays in a single whorl (about 19 rays per whorl) with a center disk (to 2 1/2"" diameter) of numerous (to around 500), tiny, spirally-arranged, baby pink disk florets.  Flowers bloom from late spring to late summer, sometimes with additional sporadic bloom until frost.  Strigose, widely-serrate, dark green leaves (to 7” long) are narrow-ovate.

Best grown in peaty, fertile, well-drained but consistently moist soils in light shade.  Tolerates full shade.  Avoid full sun.  Performs best in cool summer climates.  Intolerant of drought.  Propagate by division or seed.   Site in locations protected from strong winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Deinanthe bifida, commonly called two-lobed false hydrangea, is an herbaceous perennial which typically grows to 2' tall and as wide.   It is native to cool moist alpine forests in Japan.  White flowers in terminal clusters (corymbs) bloom above the foliage in summer.  Each flower cluster (up to 20 blooms) has both inner bisexual flowers and a lesser number of larger sterile flowers (to  1/4"" diameter) which are found on the flower cluster margins.  Sterile flowers attract pollinators for the smaller fertile flowers.  Flowers generally resemble those of some hydrangeas.  Leathery, broad ovate to elliptic, hydrangea-like leaves (4-8"" long) are stalked, rough-textured and  coarsely-toothed.  As suggested by the common name, each leaf has two pointed lobes at the leaf tip.  Although related to hydrangea, deinanthe is an herbaceous perennial whereas hydrangea is a woody shrub or vine.Genus name comes from the Greek words deinos meaning wondrous and anthe meaning flower in reference to the flowers.Specific epithet means cleft into two parts.

Easily grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Thrives in moist soils, and appreciates a summer mulch which helps retain soil moisture.  Bloom occurs on old wood.  Prune if needed immediately after flowering (little pruning is usually needed).  Winter damaged stems may be pruned in early spring.  Plants should be given a sheltered location and winter protection (e.g., mulch, burlap wrap) in USDA Zone 5, particularly when not fully established.  Plants can lose significant numbers of flower buds or die to the ground in harsh winters (temperatures below -10 degrees F), thus respectively impairing or totally destroying the bloom for the coming year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hydrangea quercifolia, commonly called oak leaf hydrangea, is an upright, broad-rounded, suckering, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that typically grows 4-6' (less frequently to 8') tall.  It is native to bluffs, moist woods, ravines and stream banks from Georgia to Florida to Louisiana.  It is noted for producing pyramidal panicles of white flowers in summer on exfoliating branches clad with large, 3-7 lobed, oak-like, dark green leaves.The genus name Hydrangea comes from hydor meaning ""water"" and aggeion meaning ""vessel"", in reference to the cup-like capsular fruit.Specific epithet is in reference to the leaves that look like those of Quercus (oak).

Culture
Winter hardy to zones 7 to 10, Jasminum officinale prefer full sun to partial shade and a warm site. They grow well in regular garden soil with moderate levels of soil fertility and moisture, and they need frequent pinching and shaping to control growth. Indoors, jasmine are vigorous growers and most require support. They bloom from spring to fall and rest from October to March. After flowering, they should be pruned drastically. Repot, if necessary, at this time. They require high humidity and plenty of light to flower. Jasmine may be placed outdoors from May to September in partial shade. Keep plants cool in winter and let them rest. Make sure plants receive adequate, generous moisture during the growing season, but with good drainage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jasminum officinale, commonly called jasmine, is one of the first plants that comes to mind when one thinks of sweet fragrance. A single jasmine vine can perfume an entire room or garden. It is a sprawling, somewhat twining deciduous shrub, usually pruned heavily to keep its size contained. The foliage is slightly downy with pinnate leaves, having 5 to 9 leaflets. The flowers are white or very pale pink and fragrant from early summer to autumn.Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet means sold in shops.
","
Problems
Jasminum officinale is usually trouble free, but you should watch for mealybugs, scale and whitefly. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In warmer climates, jasmine can be pruned and used as hedging plants. It is not hardy north of zone 7 and should therefore be brought inside in late summer or early fall. With its long blooming time and relatively easy culture, jasmine is a nice addition to an indoor garden or can be used as a container plant on a patio or deck to add fragrance to your outdoor living areas.

Top growth winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 (roots hardy to Zone 9). In St. Louis, grow as annual bedding plants or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool (40s) locations. Container plants can be trained as standards. Easily grown as bedding plants in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates poor soils. Since plants for bedding are relatively inexpensive, most gardeners purchase new plants each spring rather than trying to overwinter ones from the current year. Cultivars generally do not come true from seed, however, so cuttings may be taken in summer from favorite plants for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lantana camara, commonly called lantana or shrub verbena, is native to the Central and South America. It is an upright frost-tender shrub that grows 3-6’ tall. It has escaped gardens throughout the world and is considered to be a noxious weed in many frost-free/tropical areas where it can rapidly spread to form dense thickets. It has naturalized in parts of the southern U.S. including southern Florida, the Gulf Coast and southern California. When grown in St. Louis, plants placed out in spring after last frost date may grow to as much as 3-4’ tall by the end of the summer. Tiny 5-lobed flowers in dense hemispherical clusters (to 2” diameter) bloom summer to fall. Flower colors include white, yellow, orange, red and purple, often mixed in the same cluster. Ovate, toothed, dark green leaves (to 4” long) are rough-wrinkled above. Leaves are aromatic when bruised. Many cultivars and hybrids are available, including dwarf and trailing plants, to the point where this species is seldom found in commerce. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Viburnum transferred to this genus.Specific epithet is a South American vernacular name for a species of Lantana.

Melissa officinalis, commonly called lemon balm, is a bushy herbaceous perennial of the mint family that is typically grown in herb gardens and border fronts for its lemon-scented leaves. It is native to southern Europe, but has escaped gardens and naturalized in many parts of the U.S. (Eastern, Midwestern and Pacific Northwest states). Wrinkled, ovate, medium green leaves (to 3” long) appear in pairs on square stems rising to 2’ tall. Tiny, two-lipped, white flowers appear in the leaf axils throughout summer. Although the flowers are ornamentally inconspicuous, honey bees love them.  Leaves are edible and may be added to salads, soups, sauces or vegetables. Leaves are also used to flavor teas. Dried leaves may be added to sachets and potpourri. Plants also have a history of herbal medicine usage for a variety of purposes including, inter alia, calming nervous disorders, soothing insect bites and treating colds.Genus name comes from the Greek word melissa meaning a honeybee, also the name of a Cretan princess who first discovered how to obtain honey.Specific epithet means found in shops. Applied to plants with real or supposed medicinal properties.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus chinensis, commonly called Chinese juniper, is a dioecious evergreen conifer that is native to China, Japan, Mongolia and the Himalayas. It is often seen in the wild as a conical tree to 50’ tall and 20’ wide, but also appears in much shorter shrubby or spreading forms. Foliage is dark green. Brown bark on mature stems peels in strips. Although species plants are rarely sold in commerce, a large number of cultivated varieties ranging in size from large trees to large/small shrubs to low-growing groundcovers have become popular ornamental landscape plants. Chinese juniper leaves come in two types: scale-like (adult) and awl/needle-like (juvenile). Cones (pollen and seed-bearing) appear on different plants. Male plants produce catkin-like pollen cones. Female plants produce fleshy, berry-like, whitish-blue seed cones that usually acquire violet-brown tones as they mature over two years.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet means of China.'Spearmint' is a Chinese juniper cultivar with a dense, columnar to narrow-pyramidal habit, typically maturing to 10-15' tall but to only 4' wide. Features mostly scale-like, bright green foliage which is attractive year-round.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Junipers are generally susceptible to tip and needle blights. Cedar-apple rust and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers. Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils. Canker may attack bark or main stems. Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, webworms and scale.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade.  Tolerant of a wide range of soils from well-drained sandy soils to the heavy clays present in much of the St. Louis area.  Prefers moist soils.  Best in full sun.  Less vigorous with decreased flowering and tendency to flop in too much shade.  Tolerant of summer heat and humidity.  Clumps slowly expand in circumference by short rhizomes, but typically retain tight clump shape.  Foliage should be left standing throughout the winter for visual interest and crown protection.  Cut foliage close to the ground in late winter just before new shoots appear.  Propagate by division of the crown.  This grass will reseed to the point of being somewhat invasive in the milder parts of its growing range.  Mulch helps prevent reseeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Miscanthus sinensis, commonly known as Chinese silver grass, Japanese silver grass or eulalia grass, is a clump-forming warm season grass that typically grows to 3-7’ tall.  It is native to lowlands and lower alpine areas in Japan, Korea and China.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in over 25 states in the Central and Eastern U.S. east of the Mississippi River plus in several western States including Colorado and California.   

This grass features a dense clump of upward-arching stems and leaves which give it a rounded, fountain-like appearance.  Linear leaves (to 3-4’ long and 3/8” wide) have tapered tips, serrate margins and whitish to silvery midribs.  Foliage often turns attractive shades of yellow to orange by mid-fall before gradually fading to beige-tan for winter.  Pink to red flowers in feathery, whisk-like, loose terminal panicles (8-10” long) bloom above the foliage from late August to October.  Flower panicles gradually turn beige by mid-fall as the seeds mature.  Flower panicles and foliage both retain good arching shape, beige color and ornamental interest throughout winter, with enhanced attractiveness often coming from a covering of new fallen snow.    

Miscanthus sinensis will spread somewhat invasively in the landscape, particularly in some of the milder areas of its growing range.  It often initially spreads to disturbed sites such as roadsides, railroad right-of-ways or woodland margins.  Invasive potential for the species is significant, but is of less concern for many of the numerous ornamental cultivars, some of which are sterile.Genus name comes from the Greek words miskos meaning a stem and anthos meaning flower in reference to the stalked spikelets.Specific epithet means Chinese.This grass was once included in the genus Eulalia, but was subsequently reclassified to the genus Miscanthus with retention of its common name of Eulalia grass by many gardeners.'Zebrinus', knows as zebra grass, is a clump-forming grass noted for its horizontally banded foliage which is reminiscent of both the popular M. s. 'Strictus' and M. s. 'Puenktchen'. However, 'Zebrinus' clumps are rounded, tend to flop and often need support, whereas 'Strictus' and 'Puenktchen' both feature spiky, upright leaf blades in narrower clumps which usually do not need staking. 'Zebrinus' typically forms a substantial foliage clump to 4-6' tall, however it sends up flower stalks to 2' above the foliage clump, thus bringing the total height of the grass to 6-8' tall when in flower. Features dark green leaves with zebra-striped, golden yellow bands extending horizontally across the leaves at irregular intervals. Foliage gradually fades to tan after frost. Tiny pink/copper-tinted flowers appear in tassel-like inflorescences above the foliage in late summer, gradually turning into silvery white plumes in fall. Flower plumes persist well into winter providing good winter interest.
","
Problems
No frequently occurring insect or disease problems.  In some areas of the U.S., miscanthus mealybug and miscanthus blight are becoming significant problems.  Miscanthus mealybug causes stunted growth and is difficult to eradicate because it lives inside the stems.  Miscanthus blight is a fungal disease which attacks the blades and sheaths.  Leaf rust may occur.'Zebrinus' clumps may need staking and are susceptible to collapsing in winter from heavy snows.
","
Garden Uses

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Muhlenbergia capillaris, commonly called pink muhlygrass or pink hair grass, is a clump-forming, warm season, perennial grass that is noted for its attractive summer foliage and spectacular clouds of fall flowers. It is native to prairies, pine barrens, and open woodlands from Massachusetts to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it most frequently occurs in acidic soils in open woods, glades or openings along roads primarily in central Ozark and western areas south of the Missouri River (see Steyermark). Glossy, wiry, thread-like, dark green leaves and stems form an attractive basal clump to 2’ tall. It is the fall flowering, however, that most distinguishes this grass. Masses of airy, open, loosely branched inflorescences (each to 12” long) in pink to pinkish-red float above the foliage in a lengthy fall bloom. Tan seed plumes remain attractive in winter. Plants typically grow to 3’ tall x 3’ wide when in flower.Genus name honors Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg (1753-1815), Lutheran pastor in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., distinguished amateur botanist.Specific epithet means fine or hair-like.'White Cloud' was introduced by Superior Trees Nursery of Lee, Florida. It is slightly larger and more upright than the species and blooms a little later. It has fluffy plumes of delicate white flowers in late summer and fall that rise a foot above the narrow blue green foliage. The flowering stalks will mature and persist into winter. ‘White Cloud’ grows 3 to 4 ft. tall and 2 to 3 ft. wide.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Best initially grown with constant moisture, but once established in the landscape it will grow in a wide range of soil conditions ranging from wet swampy areas to dry xeric uplands.  This shrub is also tolerant of high winds and salt spray, and may be grown in seaside areas.  Fixes atmospheric nitrogen which helps it survive in poor soils.  Shrubs tend to sucker, sometimes forming sizable colonies in optimum growing conditions.  This shrub is similar to northern bayberry (M. pennsylvanica), but is by contrast a southern heat-loving evergreen species.   

This species is dioecious (male and female flowers borne in catkins on separate plants).  Female plants are preferred in the landscape because they produce the attractive and sometimes useful fruit.  At least one male plant is needed to facilitate pollination of the female flowers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Morella cerifera, commonly known as southern wax myrtle or southern bayberry, is a large, irregularly-shaped, dense-branching, nitrogen-fixing, suckering, fast-growing, evergreen  shrub (semi-evergreen in colder northern parts of the growing area) that typically grows to 10-15’ tall and 8-10’ wide, but occasionally reaches a tree-like height of 20’ tall or more.  It is native to the southeastern U.S. from New Jersey to Florida through the Gulf States to Oklahoma and Texas and further south into Mexico and Central America.  It is typically found in a variety of habitats including wetlands, river margins, sand dunes, pine barrens, hillsides, and upland forests.

The fruits of this species have been used for many years to make bayberry candles, soaps and sealing wax.

Glossy, aromatic, oblanceolate, olive green leaves (to 3-5” long) are dotted with tiny yellow resin glands.  Leaves, particularly the new growth, emit the distinctive bayberry candle fragrance when crushed.  Flowers are fragrant but non-showy, with only the flowers on male plants (catkins to 1” long) displaying some color (a drab yellowish-green).  Flowers bloom in late winter to early spring.  Pollinated female flowers are followed by small attractive clusters of tiny, globose, blue-gray fruits which mature in late summer to fall, with persistence through winter.  Each fruit is surrounded by an aromatic waxy substance.  

Birds eat the fruits in fall and winter, thus helping the plants to naturalize by disbursing the seed.     

These shrubs are considered to be potential fire hazards in some areas because the leaves, stems and branches contain flammable aromatic compounds.         

Myrica cerifera is a synonym.Specific epithet means wax-bearing.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf browning typically occurs in cold winters.  Watch for leaf anthracnose and leaf mosaic.
","
Garden Uses
Garden ornamental with a history of use for medicinal purposes and candlemaking.  This is a versatile shrub that can be used in woodland gardens or shrub borders, as a screen or informal hedge, in wet or shady sites, or on a bank for erosion control.  Salt tolerance makes it appropriate for locations near roads that are salted in winter.  Interesting plant for grouping in the corner of a large herb garden.  Good selection for stream or pond margins where periodic flooding or drought may occur.  Also attractive as a small tree with lower limbs removed.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Some tolerance for full shade, but foliage often grows best in sun with some afternoon shade.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers rich, moist, humusy ones.  Best with consistent watering.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Best fruiting occurs when grown in groups.  Single specimens may fruit poorly.  This shrub is evergreen in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10.  In the St. Louis area, it is considered to be semi-evergreen to deciduous because plants will typically lose their foliage (become deciduous) as soon as winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F., with the stems sometimes dying to the ground.  Plants are not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area, and if grown therein, should be sited in protected locations with organic winter mulches applied.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Nandina domestica, commonly called heavenly bamboo, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub that is ornamentally grown for its interesting foliage and its often spectacular fruit display.  It is native to Japan, China and India.  This is a rhizomatous, upright, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 4-8’ tall and to 2-4’ wide.  In St. Louis, it is semi-evergreen to deciduous, and typically grows shorter since the stems often will die to the ground in winter.  Although it belongs to the Barberry family, it is commonly called heavenly bamboo because its erect, cane-like stems and compound leaves resemble bamboo.  Tiny whitish flowers with yellow anthers appear in late spring in loose, erect, terminal clusters.  Flowers are followed by sprays of spherical, two-seeded, red berries which persist from fall to spring, providing winter interest. 

Heavenly bamboo tends to invade adjacent lands including certain forested areas of the southeastern U.S. and naturalize therein. It is now considered to be an invasive species in some southern states. Additionally, the berries of Nandina domestica have been linked to toxicity in cedar waxwing birds.Genus name is the Latinized form of the Japanese name of this plant Nanten.Specific epithet means domesticated.'Aka', commonly sold under the trade name of BLUSH PINK, is a non-flowering sport of Nandina domestica 'Firepower'.  It was discovered growing at the tissue culture facility of Magnolia Gardens Nursery in Magnolia, Texas in November of 2004.  It is a compact form that grows to only 2.5' tall and to 3' wide.  It does not produce flowers or fruit, and is basically grown for its attractive foliage.  New growth leaves of BLUSH PINK emerge blush pink in spring and retain that color throughout summer and fall.  It takes a full year before the new growth leaves finally lose their pink color and mature to deep green.  From spring to fall, foliage contains green mature leaves topped by pink new growth leaves.  Foliage of the plant generally turns red in winter.  By contrast, Nandina domestica 'Firepower' leaves emerge lime green and remain green until winter.   Cultivar name of Aka means red in Japanese in obvious reference to leaf color.  It should be noted that the year-round multi-colored foliage display of BLUSH PINK can be best appreciated in USDA Zones 7-10 where plants are evergreen, but usually comes up short in the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6) where plants are only semi-evergreen to deciduous.   U. S. Plant Patent PP19,916 was issued on April 14, 2009.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage may develop chlorosis in alkaline soils.
","
Garden Uses
Plant form, foliage, fall color make this an interesting ornamental for the landscape. Group or mass for best effect. Shrub borders or open woodland gardens. Foundations. Good in informal settings. Can be used as an informal hedge in warm winter climates where it remains evergreen and does not die to the ground.Excellent edger because of dwarf size.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Nephrolepis exaltata, commonly called sword fern or Boston fern, is native to Florida, West Indies, Mexico, Central America, South America, Polynesia and Africa. It is an evergreen fern that grows with an upright spreading habit to 3’ tall and as wide. In its native habitat, it may grow to as much as 7’ tall. It is an easy and popular fern to grow indoors. Generally sword-shaped fronds have shallow toothed to entire pinnae. Fronds initially grow upward but arch gracefully with age. A number of different forms are available in commerce including the very popular cultivar ‘Bostoniensis’, commonly called Boston fern, which many years ago earned the reputation of being a classic parlor fern. A number of additional cultivars in commerce feature such variations as curly, wavy, twisted, drooping, double-pinnate and overlapping fronds.Genus name comes from the Greek words nephros meaning a kidney and lepis meaning a scale.Specific epithet means very tall or lofty.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cascabela thevetia, commonly called yellow oleander, is native to the West Indies, southern Mexico and Belize. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree that is in the same family as and closely related to Nerium oleander, commonly known as oleander. Primary differences between the two oleanders are: yellow oleander has yellow flowers and alternate leaves and oleander has pink or white flowers with leaves in whorls of three. Yellow oleander will grow to 20-30’ tall in its native habitat, but much shorter in the St. Louis area. It is an upright shrub that features willow-like, linear-lanceolate, glossy green leaves (to 6-7” long) with distinctive midribs and large 3” long funnel-shaped sometimes-fragrant yellow (less commonly apricot) flowers in few-flowered terminal clusters (cymes). Flowers bloom from summer to fall. Flowers give way to black seed pods, each containing 1-2 nut-like seeds. As with many of the dogbane family members, plant stems exude a milky sap when cut and all parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested. Plant saps can cause allergic skin reactions in some people. Smoke from burning plant material can also be toxic. May be trained as a standard. Seeds (1” diameter) are sometimes carried as talismen in the West Indies, where the shrubs are also commonly called lucky nut. 

Synonymous with Thevetia peruviana and Cascabela peruviana.Genus name comes from the Spanish word cascabela meaning small bell in reference to the shape of the flower.Specific epithet honors André Thevet (1502-1592) a French monk who traveled in Brazil and Guiana.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Phlomis fruticosa, commonly called Jerusalem sage, is native to the Mediterranean. It is a pubescent, mounding, shrubby perennial that grows to 2-4’ tall. Plants perform best in USDA Zones 8-10 where they remain evergreen in winter. Wrinkled, ovate to lanceolate, gray-green leaves (to 5” long) of this mint family member have a sage-like appearance but no aroma or taste. Whorls of yellow flowers bloom in spherical clusters (verticillasters) along the upper half of stems and at the stem ends in summer. Additional flushes of bloom may occur throughout the remainder of the growing season if stems are promptly cut back after flowering.Genus name comes from the Greek name phlomis for some plant possibly not of this genus.Specific epithet means shrubby and short.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this date palm is best grown in fertile, medium moisture, well drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Although this palm will withstand some frost in winter, it is likely to suffer significant frond damage or die when temperatures dip to 20 degrees F.  Best with deep and even moisture. Established plants have respectable drought tolerance. Plants will naturalize to the point of being invasive in some growing conditions (seed floats down watercourses or seed is spread by bird populations). Invasive spread has been observed in southern California where plants have invaded watercourses, orchards, coastlines and to a lesser extent some landscaped areas.  This palm performs well in containers where much more compact growth typically occurs.  Container plants often thrive in a soil based potting mix in full sun, but with some part shade during the heat of the day. In cool climates, containers may be overwintered indoors in bright but cool (55-65 degree F.) temperatures. If container soils are overwatered, leaflet tips turn yellowish-black.  If container soils are underwatered, fronds will sag.  Reduce watering of indoor plants in winter but do not allow soils to totally dry out. Container plants tend to remain compact for long periods of time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Phoenix canariensis, commonly called Canary Island date palm, is a large evergreen palm tree with a massive trunk that matures to 40-60' (less frequently to as much as 90') tall. Notwithstanding size, this palm is a slow grower which may only reach 10' tall over the first 15 years. The trunk is topped with a rounded crown of upright arching palmate leaves which gracefully spread to 20-40' wide. Although native to the Canary Islands, this palm is now grown in frost-free areas around the world. In the U.S., it is grown in Florida, Georgia (southern coast), Gulf Coast, Texas (southern), Arizona, Nevada and California.  It will grow in Hawaii, but distribution there appears to be limited.  This palm is noted for having a massive, thick, columnar, single, gray-brown trunk (matures to as much as 4' in diameter) with distinctive diamond-shaped leaf base scars. Trunk is topped by arching pinnate fronds (each to 15-20' long). Each frond has 80-100 rigid, narrow, lanceolate leaflets (to 12-18"" long) on each side of the central rachis. The leafless lower portion of each petiole is covered with sharp spines (2-3"" long). Creamy white to pale yellow flowers in dense, pendant panicles (to 3-4' long) bloom on male and female plants (dioecious) intermittently throughout the year. Flowers on female palms are followed by yellow-orange, date-like fruits (to 1"" long) which are ornamentally showy but poor-tasting to the point of being only technically edible.Genus name comes from the Greek name.Specific epithet means of the Canary Islands.
","
Problems
Susceptible to lethal yellowing. Leaf spots and rots. Mealybugs, scale and thrips are often present on young plants. Spider mites may attack container plants.   Fruit drop can be messy.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this palm may be grown in a variety of locations including along streets, slopes, skylines or parks. Excellent in groves or small groupings.  It can be  planted on residential lawns as a specimen, but it needs a very large space. Additional residential area options include growth as a container plant on patios or near entrances. Where winter temperatures are too cool, container plants can be overwintered indoors.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Picea glauca, commonly called white spruce, is an extremely hardy evergreen conifer that is native to upland areas and lake/stream margins stretching from Alaska across the boreal forest of Canada to Newfoundland, dipping south to Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York.  This tree typically grows 60-80' tall (less frequently to 140' tall) with a cone-shaped crown.  It diminishes in size to low, shrubby forms near tree line in northern Canada.  Blue-green needles (to 3/4"") on small woody pegs have sharp tips.  Needles are pungently aromatic when  crushed.  Needles have a glaucous (white waxy coating) bloom, hence the specific epithet and common name.  Branchlets do not droop.  Cylindrical pale brown cones (to 2.5"" long) have flexible scales.Genus name is reportedly derived from the Latin word pix meaning pitch in reference to the sticky resin typically found in spruce bark.Specific epithet both are in reference to the fact that mature needles of this tree become glaucous (acquire a waxy white bloom) with age.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to needle and stem rust, canker, trunk and root rot.  Yellow-headed spruce sawfly, spruce budworm and eastern spruce beetle are problems in some areas.  Mites are common and repeated infestations can do serious injury to the plant.  Intolerant of urban stresses (pollution, salt spray).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus macrocarpa, commonly called bur oak or mossycup oak, is one of the most majestic of the native North American oaks. It is a medium to large sized deciduous oak of the white oak group that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 150’) tall with a broad-spreading, rounded crown. Acorn cups are covered with a mossy scale or bur near the rim, hence the common names. It is native to a variety of habitats in central and eastern North America. Best growth occurs in bottomland soils, particularly in the Ohio River valley. In Missouri, it typically occurs in low woods and stream valleys in the Ozark region, but on dry upland soils in the unglaciated parts of the state north of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 1 1/2” long), with fringed, burry cups that extend to approximately 1/2 to 3/4 the acorn length. Acorns are an important source of food for wildlife. Leathery, dark green leaves (6-12” long) with 5-9 rounded lobes are variable in shape, but usually have a pair of deep central sinuses that extend nearly to the midrib giving the leaf a waisted appearance. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow-brown. Twigs sometimes are ridged with corky wings.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and carpa meaning fruit in reference to the large acorn size.
","
Problems
Oaks are susceptible to a large number of diseases, including oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew. Potential insect pests include scale, oak skeletonizer, leaf miner, galls, oak lace bugs, borers, caterpillars and nut weevils. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, bur oak is generally considered to be a low-maintenance, long-lived tree.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus texana is a deciduous oak that typically grows in wet, heavy, bottomland soils in floodplain forests in the Mississippi River valley from far western Kentucky, the southern tip of Illinois and the southeastern lowlands region of Missouri (the Bootheel) south to Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast from Alabama to Texas. It grows 50-80’ tall with a wide-spreading, rounded crown. Insignificant yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring shortly after the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 1¼” long) with scaly cups. Dark green leaves (4-8” long) are deeply divided into 6-11 spiny, pointed lobes. Axillary tufts of tomentum on the lower surface vein angles are distinctive. Gereral leaf shape is reminiscent of the closely related pin oaks and schumard oaks. Fall color comes late, but often includes quality shades of red. Q. texana as currently described is synonymous with and formerly known as Q. nuttallii, Q. nuttallii var. cachensis, Q. rubra var. texana, Q. shumardii var. microcarpa and Q. shumardii var. texana. Unfortunately, nomenclature and common names for this tree have become considerably confused over time.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet means of Texas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus virginiana, commonly called live oak, is a large, long-lived, evergreen oak that typically grows 40-80’ tall with a short trunk, low branching and a broad-spreading rounded crown. It is native to coastal plains and woods from Virginia to southern Florida and Texas. This is a majestic tree whose massive spreading limbs and branches are often seen draped with Spanish moss in many parts of its range. Live oaks were planted along many old southern plantation roads and over time have become a symbol of the South. Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring. Fruits are ellipsoidal acorns (to 1” long), with scaly cups that extend to approximately 1/3 the acorn length. Acorns are valued food for a variety of wildlife. Elliptic to obovate, leathery, shiny dark green leaves (to 5” long) have smooth edges. Leaves are evergreen. Wood makes excellent fuel because of its high density. Live oak acorns mature in one season.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet means of Virginia.
","
Problems
In its native range, live oak is generally considered to be a long-lived, low-maintenance tree. Root rot may attack coastal trees. Oak wilt is a serious problem in some areas. Insect galls may damage foliage appearance.

Culture
Best grown in acidic, humusy, well-drained loams in part shade.  This species of azalea is tolerant of moist to wet soils including ones with somewhat poor drainage (its native habitat is swampy lowland areas).  It also tolerates periodic flooding, but will not grow in soils where the roots are submerged in water.  Root rot is less likely to occur with this species.  Prefers a sun dappled shade or high open part shade.  Foliage may scorch in full sun unless soils are kept uniformly moist.  Roots must never be allowed to dry out. Acidify soils prior to planting and thereafter as needed.  This azalea should never be planted near a black walnut or butternut tree (roots of both trees produce toxic juglones which will typically damage or kill rhododendrons/azaleas growing within or close to the drip line of either tree).  It is best sited in a location protected from strong winter winds.  This shrub has a shallow, fibrous root system (do not cultivate around the shrub) and will benefit from a good mulch (wood chips, bark or pine needles) for retention of moisture, stabilization of soil temperatures and winter protection.  Clip off spent flower clusters immediately after bloom as practicable.  Plants will slowly naturalize by root suckers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Rhododendron viscosum, commonly known as swamp azalea, is a loose, upright-spreading, deciduous woody shrub that typically grows to 3-5' (less frequently to 8') tall.  Branching opens up with age.  It is one of 17 species of azalea which are native to the U.S.   It is typically found in swamps, bogs, stream margins and wet lowlands from southwestern Maine to northeastern Ohio south to Florida and Alabama.  It may be found at some higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains.  Fragrant (musky clove-like aroma), tubular, white to pale pink flowers (1 1/4"" across) bloom in clusters of 4-9 after the leaves have emerged in May-July (one of the last of the native azaleas to flower).  Each flower has 5 petal-like lobes.  Narrow, obovate to oblong-ovate leaves (to 2  1/2"" long) with wedge-shaped bases and blunt/short-pointed tips are clustered at the branch ends.  Leaves are dark green above and pale green below.  Leaves turn attractive shades of yellow, orange and purple in fall.  Branchlets are hirsute (stiff hairs).  Fruits are egg-shaped capsules (to 3/4"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek words rhodo meaning rose and dendron meaning tree. Transferred from the Greek name for Nerium oleander.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word viscosus meaning sticky in reference to the sticky substance excreted by glandular hairs on the corolla tubes of the flowers.Additional common names include clammy azalea in reference to its sticky (viscous) corolla tubes and honeysuckle azalea (even though it is a rhododendron and not a honeysuckle) in reference to the resemblance of its flowers in both appearance and fragrance to the flowers of some honeysuckles.
","
Problems
Azaleas are susceptible to many insect and disease problems, including but not limited to canker, crown rot, root rot, leaf spot, rust, powdery mildew, aphids, borers, lacebugs, leafhoppers, mealybugs, mites, nematodes, scale, thrips and whitefly.  A healthy plant in the proper environment with proper care should have limited problems, however.
","
Garden Uses
Best grouped in shrub borders, mixed borders, open woodland gardens, native plant gardens and open shade gardens.  Effective near patios or decks.  Specimen around the home.   Plants in groups with earlier blooming azaleas to extend the annual azalea bloom period.   Plants often thrive when sited in moist soils near stationary or moving water.   Good cut flower.

Rosa is a genus of about 150 species of deciduous (occasionally evergreen) shrubs and climbers noted for their beautiful, often fragrant, single, semidouble or double flowers which are borne singly or in clusters on often prickly stems clad with 5-9 leaflets often having toothed margins.

Shrub roses are usually large-growing bushes between 4-10 feet tall and as wide. They are a very diverse group of hybrids and usually produce clusters of flowers several times a year but some may bloom just once in spring. They do not require the heavy pruning required of hybrid tea, floribunda and grandiflora roses unless being pruned to control size. Plants can be allowed to grow large with minimal pruning.Genus name comes from the Latin name.'Blanc Double de Coubert' is a hybrid rugosa shrub rose which typically grows to 5' tall and as wide. Features profuse, strongly fragrant, pure white, 2-3"" diameter, semi-double flowers which bloom throughout the summer and into fall. Leathery, wrinkled, dark green foliage.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in full sun.  Good soil drainage is essential.  Plants will perform poorly and may not survive winter in hard clay soils that retain moisture.  Plants tolerate heat and some dry soils once established.  Deadhead spent flowers to promote additional bloom.  Agastache hybrids are typically winter hardy to at least USDA Zone 6.  Where winter survival is a potential problem, plants should be sited in protected locations (e.g., southern exposures) with leaf and flower stems being left in place over winter for additional protection.  Sandy/gravelly mulches will protect plants and help to avoid onset of rot.  Hybrids grown from seed will usually not come true.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache, commonly called giant hyssop, is a genus containing about 30 species of upright herbaceous perennials, most of which are native to North America.  

Agastache hybrids often have showier flowers and better winter hardiness than species plants.  Hybrid flowers come in a variety of different flower colors including shades of red, orange, pink, yellow and white.  Hybrids typically feature dense terminal spikes of tiny 2-lipped tubular flowers which bloom mid-summer to fall in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) atop 2-4’ tall stiff square stems clad with opposite pairs of serrate, fragrant (anise/licorice scented) gray-green to medium green leaves. Flowers are attractive to bees, hummingbirds and butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.‘Raspberry Summer’ is an upright, clump-forming perennial that grows to 32” tall.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Prefers moist, light, gravelly or sandy soils with good drainage.  Tolerates drought.  Avoid wet soils in winter.  This sage is a biennial or short-lived perennial.  When grown from seed, it produces downy, wrinkled, silver-gray rosettes of foliage the first year with flowering stems rising above foliage in the second year.  Flowering stems may be promptly cut off as they appear to showcase the plant foliage and to encourage perennial tendencies.  Plants that flower and seed in the second year complete their biennial course and disappear from the garden.  Some gardeners prefer to let plants bloom for enjoyment of the flowers.  Plants may continue in the garden from year to year, albeit in slightly different locations, by self-seeding.  Plant foliage tends to struggle and decline as summer progresses in hot and humid conditions south of USDA Zone 7a.  This plant is often grown as an annual.  Propagate by seed or removal of rooted lateral offshoots in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Salvia argentea, commonly called silver sage, is a clump-forming biennial or short-lived perennial that is native to the Mediterranean area (southern Europe to northern Africa).  Unlike most salvias, plants of this species are grown primarily for their large, woolly leaves and not for their flowers.  In the first year, this sage features a large rosette of soft, felt-like, broad-oval, downy, wrinkled, silver-gray leaves (to 8"" long by 6"" wide) that form an attractive foliage mound to 12"" tall and to 20"" wide.  Leaves emerge silver-white in spring but gradually mature to silver-gray to greenish-gray as the summer progresses.  In the second year, silver flower spikes rise well above the foliage to 2-3' tall, topped with tubular, hooded, white flowers that are tinged with pink.  Flowers bloom in early summer.The genus name Salvia comes from the Latin word salveo meaning ""to save or heal"", in reference to the purported medically curative properties attributed to some plants in the genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word argentum meaning silver in reference to the young leaves that emerge silver-white in spring.

Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers moist, humusy, nutrient-rich, neutral to slightly acidic loams.  Spreads by root suckers to form colonies.  Prune suckers as they appear unless naturalizing.  A large number of late winter pruning options include (a) pruning out dead or weakened stems, (b) shortening one year stems or (c) cutting some stems back to the ground to rejuvenate.  Some horticulturists recommend a hard spring pruning for maintaining best foliage appearance and habit.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sambucus racemosa, commonly known as red elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous suckering shrub which typically grows to 8-12’ tall with a somewhat sprawling habit.  It features (1) opposite, pinnate-compound, green leaves (6-9” long) which have 5-7 leaflets (each to 4” long), (2) dome-shaped clusters (panicled cymes) of numerous, late spring to early summer, tiny, fragrant, white flowers and (3) dark red (black in the case of the Rocky Mountain elderberry known as S. racemosa var. melanocarpa), summer-to-fall elderberry fruits in upright clusters.  This shrub is native to Europe, northern Asia and parts of Alaska, across Canada and the northern U.S.  south to California and New Mexico but mostly south in the central and eastern states to South Dakota, Missouri, and Georgia where it is typically found growing in moist woodlands, thickets, stream banks, fields, fence rows and roadsides.  

Fruits are sour and usually not consumed raw by humans, but may be cooked for use in the preparation of wine, jelly and pies.  Fruits are attractive to wildlife.   

Historically, Sambucus racemosa (native to Europe and Asia) was commonly known as European red elder and the very similar Sambucus pubens also known as S. racemosa var. pubens (native to North America) was known as American red elder.   Many authorities have now grouped both of these red elders together under the name of Sambucus racemosa.Genus name comes from the Latin name, perhaps connected with sambuca a kind of harp.Specific epithet means with flowers in racemes.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.   Best container growth typically occurs in a well-drained potting medium containing one part potting soil, two parts peat moss and one part sharp sand or perlite.  Soils should receive consistent but moderate moisture.  Plants will tolerate dry, slightly under-watered conditions, but soils should not be allowed to dry out or become overly moist.  Reduce watering from late winter to spring.  Fertilize plants monthly during the growing season, but reduce fertilization during fall and winter.  

Growing season for this cactus is March/April to September.  Full sun during the growing season for container plants brought outdoors will result in bleached foliage.  Ideal temperatures for the growing season are 70-80 degrees F.  In September, steps need to be taken to regulate both temperature and light exposure in order to promote good flower bud production.

Indoor plants.  In order for indoor plants to flower well during the Christmas season, it is best to provide the following as of mid-September:  (a) bright daytime light, (b) night temperatures between 55 and 65 degrees F., and (c) long nights consisting of 13 hours of total darkness (i.e., cover plant with a black cloth or place plant in a totally dark room from 6 pm to 7 am each day for 6-8 weeks).  If indoor temperatures at night can be kept at 45-55 degrees F. (which admittedly can be difficult to do in a home), buds will usually form in autumn without employing the strict 13 hour darkness regimen.    

Outdoor plants.  For plants grown outdoors during the growing season, mid-September nighttime temperatures in the 50-55 degree F. range usually will induce production of flower buds prior to the point where the plant is brought indoors for winter.  Otherwise, the temperature and darkness requirements recommended for indoor plants should be employed.  

Propagate by cuttings or grafting.  Plant stem segments in small pots; water moderately during mid-summer and fertilize lightly each month.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Schlumbergera x buckleyi, commonly called Christmas cactus, is a hybrid, flat-stemmed, frost-intolerant, winter-flowering, epiphytic perennial cactus that is typically grown indoors as a container plant for enjoyment of its colorful flowers which bloom during and after the Christmas season.  

Flat, jointed, leafless, green stem segments (phylloclades) sprawl downward over the container edges in pendant chains.  Each stem segment (to 2 1/2” long and 3/4” wide) has rounded marginal notches.  Bright magenta red to pink flowers (to 3” long) are borne at the stem ends during the period of December to February.  Fruits if present are red berries.Genus name honors Frederick Schlumberger, Belgian horticulturist.Specific epithet honors William Buckley who created this hybrid at the Rollisson Nurseries in England around 1850 by crossing two southeastern Brazilian species (S. truncate and S. russelliana).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Flower buds may drop in autumn if plants are subjected to temperatures in excess of 90 degrees F., large temperature fluctuations,  improper watering, or sudden variations caused by changes in the room environment or by moving the plant to a different location.   Root rot may occur if soils are kept overly moist.  Potential insect problems include mealybugs, soft brown scale, red spider mites and aphids. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In tropical areas, this plant can be grown outside year round as an epiphyte or in a rock garden.  In cooler climates, it is typically grown in hanging baskets or large pots.  It is sold primarily around the Christmas season as a gift item.

Cut back to the ground in late winter to early spring just before the new growth appears.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sorghastrum nutans, commonly called Indian grass, is a warm season Missouri native perennial grass which typically occurs in prairies, glades and open woods throughout the State. It was one of the dominant grasses of the tallgrass prairie which once covered large parts of the Midwest. Typically grows 3-5' tall (less frequently to 6') and is noted for its upright form and blue-green foliage. It forms upright clumps (to 2-3' tall) of slender, blue-green leaves (to 1/2"" wide and 2' long). Foliage turns orange-yellow in fall and usually retains hints of color into the winter. Stiff, vertical flowering stems, topped with narrow, feathery, light brown flower panicles (to 12"" long) highlighted with yellow stamens, rise well above the foliage clump in late summer to 5-6' tall. Panicles darken to bronze/chestnut brown in fall as they mature, later fading to gray. Panicles continue to provide some interest well into winter.Genus name come from Greek and means a poor imitation of sorghum.Specific epithet means to nod or nodding.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
The soil for the peace lily should be kept moist but not soggy. Let the soil dry between waterings, but do not allow to wilt; this causes the leaves to yellow. When watering, use water that is at room temperature and has been allowed to sit so that the chlorine can evaporate. Spathiphyllum grow very well with sub-irrigation. These plants do well in lower light situations, but prefer bright filtered light. Do not place in direct sun. When grown indoors, Spathiphyllum have very low fertility needs. Apply fertilizer at one quarter of the recommended strength. Over fertilizing can produce burning of tips and roots. Peace lilies enjoy warm conditions between 68 and 85F during the day and a 10 degree drop at night. Cold, and drafty conditions in the 40’s and 50’s will slow growth considerably. Extended periods below 40 can damage leaves, stems and roots. The plant requires a large pot and should be kept somewhat potbound. Repot, if necessary in February or March.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Spathiphyllum is Greek for leaf-spathe, referring to the character of the spathe, which is the bract or leaf surrounding or subtending a thick, protruding flower cluster. This easy care plant has beautiful glossy green leaves and the unusual ability to blossom in medium light. The pure white flower changes to pale green after 10 days and then remains lovely for at least another month.Genus name comes from the Greek word spathe and phyllon meaning a leaf from the leaflike spathe.
","
Problems
Few pest problems are associated with this plant. Mealybugs are probably the most common insect indoors. Because of the wide foliage, cleaning the leaves regularly with a damp cloth to remove dust will help not only in appearance but also in removing some pests which tend to gather under the bottom of the leaves.
","
Garden Uses
In recent years, peace lilies have gained a reputation for their ability to remove vaporized solvents from the atmosphere. Because of this, along with their ability to flower with fairly low light levels, they are widely used as pot plants in shopping malls and offices.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Too much shade, however, may impede leaf drying and promote the onset of disease. The woolly leaves of this plant tend to trap moisture, and in humid climates such as the St. Louis area, plant leaves are susceptible to attack from rot and leaf spot where too much moisture is present. Plants are generally drought tolerant. Avoid overwatering. If mid-summer foliage decline occurs, pick off damaged leaves as needed. Spreads by creeping stems that root as they go along the ground and can be mildly aggressive in rich soils. Site starter plants 12-18” apart for use as a ground cover. Divide when necessary. Flowers are not particularly showy, and many gardeners prefer to remove the flowering stems as they appear to enhance the ground cover effect.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Stachys byzantina, known as lamb's ears, is grown primarily for its thick, soft, velvety, silver-gray leaves which typically form a rapidly spreading mat approximately 4-6"" off the ground. Leaves are evergreen in warm climates, but will depreciate considerably in harsh winters. Erect, small-leaved flowering stems with terminal spikes of insignificant, tiny, purplish-pink flowers appear in summer rising above the foliage to 10-15"" tall. Many gardeners remove the flowering stems to enhance the ground cover effect. Dense rosettes of woolly, tongue-shaped, gray-green leaves (to 4"" long) spread by runners. Leaf shape and texture resemble a lamb's ear, hence the common name.Genus name comes from the Greek stacys meaning ear of corn in probable reference to the inflorescence of a related plant.Specific epithet means of classical Byzantium (Istanbul, Turkey).'Big Ears' is noted for its silver-green foliage which forms an attractive ground cover. Dense rosettes of thick, soft, velvety, silver-green leaves (to 8"" long) form a mat approximately 8"" off the ground. Flowering stems are rare. Leaf shape and texture resemble a lamb's ear, hence the common name. Leaves are evergreen in warm climates, but will depreciate considerably in harsh winters. This cultivar is synonymous with 'Helene von Stein'.
","
Problems
Tends to rot and develop leaf diseases in humid summer climates. Well-drained soils are essential in order to combat potential rot problems which often occur in humid St. Louis summers. Even with well-drained soils, some summer die-out may occur where high humidity and/or moisture on foliage is present. Can spread aggressively.'Big Ears' has better resistance to problems than the species and many other cultivars thereunder, and is a good selection for the St. Louis area.

Plants have good heat and drought tolerance, but generally appreciate consistent moisture during the growing season. Plants will grow in part shade, but with decreased flowering. Tuberous roots spread over time. In the St. Louis area (Zone 6), plants may be grown as if they were annuals (repurchasing new plants each spring) or they may be grown in containers (for decks, porches or terraces or planted to the rim in garden areas) with the containers brought indoors each year before first fall frost for overwintering in a bright, cool area (40-50 degrees F) with very minimal watering. Notwithstanding the recommended winter hardness zones for this species, plants grown directly in the ground may survive mild St. Louis winters if they are sited in protected locations and given winter mulch.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tulbaghia violacea, commonly called society garlic, is a tender perennial that is native to grassland areas in southern Africa. It somewhat resembles garlic chives (Allium tuberosum) in appearance. From a tuberous rootstock, a clump of narrow, strap-shaped, gray-green leaves rises to 12” tall. Leaves and rootstock have a strong garlic smell when bruised, hence the common name. In early summer, flowering scapes rise to 20” tall bearing terminal umbels of sweetly fragrant lilac-pink flowers. Each small flower (3/4” long) has a tubular corona spreading to an open star with six pointed tepals. Flowering continues on and off throughout the summer into fall. Flowers and leaves are edible (mild garlic flavor), and may be used in soups and salads.Genus name honors Rijk Tulbagh (1699-1771), Dutch Governor of the Cape of Good Hope.Specific epithet means violet-colored.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs and snails may damage the foliage. All parts of this plant emit a strong garlic odor, which contributes to its deer and rabbit resistance. However, some find the odor objectionable, so take this into consideration when using near trafficked areas or in a patio container.

Species plants are self-incompatible, meaning that another cultivar or seed-grown species plant should be planted nearby for pollination and subsequent fruit production to occur. Promptly remove root suckers to prevent colonial spread unless naturalization is desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Viburnum is a genus of about 150 species of deciduous, evergreen and semi-evergreen shrubs and a few trees from chiefly North Temperate regions extending into Southeast Asia and South America. They are grown for their attractive flowers, colorful fruit and attractive foliage. Some species have edible fruit or fragrant flowers. They are very attractive, versatile garden plants.

Several hybrids available in commerce today are derived from crossing V. japonicum (evergreen Japanese viburnum to 6-8’ tall) and V. dilatatum (deciduous linden viburnum to 8-10’ tall).  These hybrids are semi-evergreen and typically grow to 8’ tall and as wide and generally feature white spring flowers in cymes, red berries in fall and maroon to purple fall foliage color.Genus name comes from the Latin name of a species plant.‘Royal Guard’ is primarily noted for its narrow upright habit and glossy leaves that turn burgundy in fall. It features dark green elliptic to oval leathery leaves (to 4” long) that are lustrous above and attractive throughout the growing season. Leaf undersides, buds and young stems are covered with rusty brown hairs. One of the easiest ways to distinguish this plant from the similar black haw (V. prunifolium) is the presence of rusty brown hairs. Tiny flowers in showy rounded cymes (to 5” across) bloom in spring. Flowers are followed by clusters of edible blue berries (to 3/8” long) that ripen in September to October. Birds are attracted to the fruit. Foliage turns an attractive burgundy in fall.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Yucca brevifolia, commonly known as Joshua tree, is a large, slow-growing, evergreen, tree form yucca native only to the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. It is found growing at elevations between 1,600-7,200' on open, rocky grasslands where they visually dominate the landscape. Mature individuals usually reach around 15-30' tall (sometimes to 50' or more) with an open, rounded canopy of equal width. The average lifespan of a Joshua tree is estimated at 150 years, but older trees exceeding 300 years old have been recorded. Younger plants lack the distinctive branching of older specimens. The stiff, narrow, tapered leaves (between 6-14"" long and 0.25-0.5"" wide) have terminal spines and small serrations along the margins. The foliage forms rosettes on the ends of the branches, and desiccated leaves remain on the plant covering the trunk and stems. The creamy white, round to ovate flowers (up to 2"" long and 1"" wide) are borne on terminal panicles (up to 20"" long). Light green seedpods (up to 4"" long) mature on the tree in clusters. In their native habitat, Joshua trees are an important source of food and shelter for wildlife. Many birds utilize the branches for nesting and perching. These include cactus wrens, northern flickers, and American kestrels. A single moth species called the yucca moth pollinates the flowers. Small mammals such as antelope squirrels and kangaroo rats eat the seeds. Joshua trees were also used by the Cahullia people of inland southern California as a source of food and fibers.Genus name comes from the Carbi name for manihot, also called cassava or yuca, which is not closely related but has similarly enlarged root structures.The specific epithet brevifolia means ""short leaves"", in reference to the length of the foliage relative to other yuccas.According to commonly held legend, the name Joshua tree was given by Mormon settlers and refers to the biblical tale of Joshua guiding the Israelites in the battle for Ai with an outstretched arm.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Yucca gloriosa, commonly called Spanish dagger or yucca, is an evergreen shrub or small tree (though it looks somewhat more like an herbaceous perennial in its early years) that is native to coastal plains, dunes and sandy woods from North Carolina to Florida. It is a single stemmed plant (2-8’ tall) that is densely covered with sword-shaped, spine-tipped blue green leaves (to 30” long and to 3” wide). Leaves originally appear as a mounded basal clump, but after several years the stem or trunk develops, typically growing to a mature height of 5’ and lifting the leaf clump off the ground. Creamy white, nodding, bell-shaped flowers appear in a dense, massive, upright, terminal panicle in summer. Fruits are elliptical dehiscent capsules.Genus name comes from the Carbi name for manihot, also called cassava or yuca, which is not closely related but has similarly enlarged root structures.Specific epithet means splendid or glorious.‘Variegata’ is a compact form of the species that features variegated foliage. It typically grows in a clump to 4’ tall. Flowers in early summer. Variegated leaves are blue green with gold changing to white margins.

Cool weather annual that is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Plant stems will droop in too much shade. Plants tolerate poor soils. Avoid wet soils. New plants may be grown each year by planting seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date or outdoors at the last spring frost date. In mild winter climates, seed may be planted outdoors in fall. Plants may reseed in the garden. Deadheading spent flower heads will limit self-seeding, but in the process removes from the garden seeds that are loved by birds. Taller plants may need staking or other support.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centaurea cyanus is an annual cornflower native to Europe that has escaped gardens and naturalized throughout much of the United States and southern Canada. In Missouri, it is typically found in fields and waste grounds and along railroads and roadsides (Steyermark). Purple-blue flowers (sometimes pink to white) bloom from late spring into summer on 1- to 3-foot tall stems clad with lyrate-pinnatifid lower leaves and narrow lanceolate upper leaves. Each flower (to 1.5” diameter) is subtended an involucre of overlapping bracts. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek word kentauros meaning centaur.Specific epithet means blue for flower color.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Zoysia japonica, commonly just called zoysia is a warm season turfgrass that spreads by stolons and rhizomes to form a dense lawn or grassy area. Advantages include durability, resistance to weeds, tolerance of drought and summer heat, ease of mowing and good green color during the growing season. Disadvantages include straw-colored appearance from mid-fall to mid-spring (goes dormant in cold weather), slow rate of spread, tendency to spread into adjacent property and inclination to produce heavy thatch. Blades may technically grow to 9"" long, but are typically mowed to 1-2"" tall.Genus name honors Karl von Zoys (1756-1800), Austrian botanist.Specific epithet means of Japan.'Compadre' (synonymous with and formerly known as 'Companion') can be planted by seed. It is of intermediate growth habit. It grows well in the Midwest transition area of which St. Louis is a part.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies balsamea, commonly called balsam fir, is native to moist woods and bottomlands from Labrador to Alberta south to northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, New England, New York and further south in the Appalachians to Virginia.  It is a primary component of the boreal forest that stretches across Canada.  This is an aromatic, symmetrical, narrow, pyramidal to conical evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown.  It typically grows to 50-70' (less frequently to 90') tall and to 15-25' wide.  It appears, albeit in a diminished shrubby form, as far north as the timber line.  Resinous branches are densely clad with flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1"" long).  Needles are unstalked with circular bases and are white-banded beneath.  Smooth gray-brown bark (greenish when young but brown and scaly on older trees) is covered with blisters which contain a sticky aromatic resin.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 2-4"" long) appear at the crown.  Cones are purple when young.  As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.  Cones disintegrate (scales drop) after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet refers to the fragrant quality of the tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include Balsam woolly adelgids, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight. Trees are generally intolerant of urban pollution.

Culture
Best grown in rich, medium moisture, slightly acidic, sandy/gravelly, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Established trees tolerate some soil dryness, but best performance usually comes with moist soils. Trees generally grow poorly in heavy clay soils. This tree thrives in areas with long winters followed by cool summer climates, and it usually does not grow well in the heat and humidity south of USDA Zone 7. It is, however, considered to be the best of the firs for tolerating the growing conditions of the Midwest.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies concolor, commonly called white fir or concolor fir, is primarily native to mountain slopes (3000-9000 feet in elevation) in the western U.S., including the southern Cascades and Sierras from Oregon to southern California and the Rockies from southern Idaho to Arizona and New Mexico. In the wild, it typically grows to 80-130’ tall, but on residential landscapes in the Midwest will more typically grow to 40-70’ tall with a spread to 20-30’. This is a narrow conical conifer with a straight trunk, spire-like crown and branching to the base. Upper branches tend to grow upward, but the lower branches tend to recline. With age, crowns flatten and lower branching begins to disappear. Soft, flattened, pale blue-green needles (to 2 1/2” long) have uniform coloration on both surfaces (specific epithet is in reference to this). Slightly barrel-shaped cones (to 3-6” long) are most often yellowish-green, maturing to brown or purple. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches. Trees may not produce cones and seeds for up to the first 40 years. Bark is ash-gray and smooth, but will furrow with age.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet means the same color throughout.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include balsam woolly adelgid, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Disease problems include root rot, needle rust and twig blight. Trees are generally intolerant of urban pollution. Broken branches often become sites for fungal infections. Strong winds may damage taller trees.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies grandis, commonly called grand fir, is a large, evergreen fir with a spire crown in youth that typically rounds into a multiple-leadered dome with age.  It is native to moist coastal bottomlands and alpine slopes from sea level to 6000’ in elevation in the Pacific Northwest from southwestern British Columbia south to northern California and in a disjunct population in the Rocky Mountains from southeastern British Columbia to central Idaho and far northwestern Montana.  It will grow to 200-250’ tall with a 4-6’ trunk diameter in Pacific coniferous forests and alpine slopes in coastal areas west of the cascades (greatest height is in coniferous rain forests on the Olympic peninsula of Washington), but to 130-160’ with a 2-4’ trunk diameter in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and in the Rocky Mountains.   This is one of the tallest firs in the world, hence the common name.  

Smooth gray bark develops ridges and furrows as it ages to brown.  Flat needles (to 2 1/2” long) are shiny dark green above with two white stomatal lines beneath.  Needles have blunt to slightly notched tips.  Needles emit a balsamy, tangerine-like aroma when crushed, hence the additional common name of stinking fir for this tree.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 4.5” long) stand upright above the needles near the tips of the upper branches, emerging green in spring, but maturing to yellowish-brown sometimes tinged blue-gray to purple.  Oblong pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils under the needles.  Pollen cones are pale yellow.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to large tree size.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  The balsam woolly adelgid is a significant problem in some areas.  Additional potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, tussock moths, aphids, bagworms and scale.  Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.  Potential disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight.

Easily grown in average, slightly acidic, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, well-drained soils.  Intolerant of drought.  Propagation is difficult (approximately 95% of seed produced is not viable).  Woody cuttings are difficult to root, but juvenile cuttings are easier to root.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer griseum, commonly called paperbark maple, is a small, deciduous, oval to oval-rounded tree with slender upright branching.  It is particularly noted for its exfoliating copper orange to cinnamon reddish/brown bark and its showy orange to red fall color.  It typically matures to 20-30 (40)’ tall.  It is native to mixed forests in central China.  Bark on the trunk and limbs is extremely ornamental because it peels into large curls which remain on the tree rather that falling to the ground, often in attractive contrast to the tan to rose-brown inner bark.  Each trifoliate leaf (3-5” long) features three coarsely toothed leaflets, with the middle leaflet being short-stalked.  Leaves are green above, but frosty blue-green to gray-green with fine hairs beneath.  Fall color varies, typically ranging from showy shades of orange and red to less spectacular shades of reddish-green to bronze green.  Ornamentally insignificant yellowish flowers bloom in April-early May in clusters (drooping cymes to 1” long) on pendulous downy stalks.  Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1 1/4” long) with unusually large seeds.

E. H. (“Chinese”) Wilson brought this tree from China to England in 1899.  It was introduced in the U. S. shortly thereafter by the Arnold Arboretum.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word griseus meaning gray in reference to color of the leaf undersides.
","
Problems

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Tolerant of heat and drought. Generally tolerant of many urban pollutants. Freely reseeds. Trees have escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S. Shallow root system.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer platanoides, commonly called Norway maple, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in urban areas throughout much of the U.S. It is a medium-sized deciduous shade tree typically growing 40-50’ tall with a dense, symmetrical, rounded crown. Leaves (to 7” across) have five sharply pointed lobes and resemble those of sugar maple. Leaf stems exude a milky sap when cut. Fall color is usually an unremarkable yellow. Small yellow flowers in erect clusters (corymbs) appear in spring before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired seeds with horizontally spreading wings (samaras to 2” long).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means resembling platanus (sycamore), which is somewhat curious since the leaves of Norway maple do not really bear that much resemblance to sycamores.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt which is usually fatal. Shallow root system can crack or heave nearby driveways or sidewalks. Shallow surface roots can interfere with turf. Bark is susceptible to sunscald and cracking (frost cracks) in winter, particularly on younger trees. The thick canopy of leaves and shallow roots severely limits what can be grown within the drip line of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Shade tree. Although once widely planted as a street tree, this use is not generally recommended in many areas now.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer rubrum, commonly called red maple, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Eastern North America from Quebec to Minnesota south to Florida and eastern Texas.  It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a rounded to oval crown.  It grows faster than Norway and sugar maples, but slower than silver maple.  In northern states, red maple usually occurs in wet bottomland, river flood plains and wet woods, but in Missouri it typically frequents drier, rocky upland areas.  Emerging new growth leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit and fall color are red or tinged with red.  Quality of red fall color on species plants is variable.  Leaves (to 2-5"" long) have 3 principal triangular lobes (sometimes 5 lobes with the two lower lobes being largely suppressed).  Lobes have toothed margins and pointed tips.  Leaves are medium to dark green above and gray green below.  Flowers on a given tree are primarily male or female or monoecious and appear in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves.  Fruit is a two-winged samara.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet of rubrum meaning red is everywhere in evidence: red flowers in dense clusters in late March to early April (before the leaves appear), red fruit (initially reddish, two-winged samara), reddish stems and twigs, red buds, and, in the fall, excellent orange-red foliage color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, leafhoppers, borers, scale and caterpillars.  Verticillium wilt attacks the vascular system and can be fatal.  Canker, fungal leaf spot and root rots may also occur.  Wind and ice may break some branches. Leaf hoppers can cause substantial damage.
","
Garden Uses
Plant as a specimen tree for the lawn, street or park. It is of note that this tree has a shallow, flattened root system that may buckle nearby sidewalks or driveways if planted too close.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist soils, but shows somewhat surprising tolerance for poor dry soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharinum commonly known as silver maple gets its name from the silvery undersides of its leaves. This is one of the largest deciduous trees native to Missouri, typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a rounded open spreading crown. It is native to eastern and central North America where it typically occurs in moist to wet, sometimes mucky, often poorly drained soils on floodplains, along the edges of streams and rivers and in low woods. It is a fast-growing, somewhat graceful tree that formerly was a very popular urban landscape selection for lawns and streets, but has more recently fallen somewhat out of favor because of the proclivity of its weak-wooded limbs to split when stressed by high winds or ice/snow. Polygamous greenish yellow flowers bloom in clusters in early spring (March) before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired samaras (to 2” long) that mature in late spring. Bark is gray to brownish gray. Mature tree trunks and limbs develop a shaggy appearance as the bark develops long thin flaky scales that exfoliate at the ends. Deeply 5-lobed light green leaves (to 6” across) have silvery undersides. Fall color is usually unremarkable. Tree sap is sweet, hence the species name which comes from the Latin word for sugar, but syrups made therefrom are greatly inferior to those made from sugar maple (Acer saccharum).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose and canker. Also susceptible to scale and borers. As with many fast growing trees, silver maple has weak brittle branches that are susceptible to breaking in high winds or when coated with ice/snow in winter. Shallow roots may damage nearby sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful large landscape tree. Weak wood is a concern. Perhaps best sited in areas of poor soil or low wet conditions where other stronger wooded trees will not grow.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharum commonly known as sugar maple is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which will typically grow 40' to 80' tall (sometimes to 100') with a dense, rounded crown. This tree is a main component of the Eastern U.S. hardwood forest and is one of the trees which is most responsible for giving New England its reputation for spectacular fall color. Medium green leaves (3-6"" wide with 3-5 lobes) turn yellow-orange in autumn, sometimes with considerable color variations. Fruit is the familiar two-winged samara. Sugar maples are long-lived trees which grow relatively slowly (somewhat faster in the first 35 years). Native Americans taught the early colonists how to tap these trees to make maple syrup which has now become a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and Canada. Excellent shade tree.  The sugar maple leaf is the national symbol of Canada.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap. Saccharum is the genus name for sugarcane.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose, cankers, leaf spot and tar spot. Also susceptible to aphids, borers and scale. Leaf scorch may be a problem in drought conditions. Has been frequently used as a street tree, but is generally intolerant of road salt, soil compaction and pollution.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Best grown in lean, dry to medium moisture, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Avoid heavy clays and moist, rich, fertile soils. Plants will tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. Plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Consider cutting back plant stems to lateral flower buds after initial flowering to tidy the planting and to encourage additional bloom. Plants may be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain the vitality of the planting. Plants will slowly spread in the garden over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea aegyptiaca var. taygetea (synonymous with and formerly known as Achillea 'Taygetea') is a clump-forming yarrow that is noted for its deeply-dissected, fern-like, gray-green leaves and its tiny, long-lasting, bright yellow flowers. Flowers gradually fade to primrose yellow as they age. Flowers appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) from early to late summer on stems typically rising to 16-24” tall.Genus name is in reference to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.This yarrow is one of the parents of the Galaxy hybrid yarrows and of Achillea 'Moonshine'.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can damage exposed plantings. If stems flop or become matted, they can be cut back.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 11. North of USDA Zone 11, plants should be grown in containers and overwintered indoors. In containers, desert rose is best grown in a loose, sandy or gravelly, well-drained soil mix in full sun. Plants have excellent heat tolerance. Apply regular moisture during periods of growth, but allow soils to dry between waterings. Regular applications of fertilizer in spring will help promote flowering. Plants can be left outdoors in sunny locations during the summer. As soon as temperatures begin to dip below 55 degrees F. in autumn, bring containers indoors to sunny but cool locations with reduced watering. Plants usually lose their leaves in winter and go into a dormancy-like period. For container plants, the best caudex usually develops from seed-grown plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adenium obesum, commonly called desert rose, is a thick-stemmed sparsely-leaved perennial succulent that is native to semi- arid, sub-Saharan regions of eastern and southwestern Africa plus the Arabian peninsula. In the wild, this plant will eventually rise to 6-9' tall, but will grow much smaller in containers. It forms a broad, swollen, often grotesque caudex (usually partially buried underground) from which rise twisted leafless gray-green to brown branches. Leathery, spirally-arranged, fleshy, ovate, gray-green leaves (to 4"" long) appear at the stem tips. Narrow, bell-shaped, salverform flowers (to 2"" across), each with five spreading lobes and five protruding stamens, are red, pink or rose with white to pale yellow throats. In the wild, flowers bloom in summer with some irregular continued bloom throughout the year. As houseplants, flowers typically bloom only in summer. Milky plant sap is poisonous.Genus name is the Latinized Arabic name aden used for Adenium obesum.Specific epithet means fat or succulent.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Sharp soil drainage is required to prevent possible onset of rots. Additional potential disease problems include fungal leaf spot. Mealybugs, scale and aphids are potential insect pests.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Best in bright but sun-dappled or filtered light in sheltered locations with good air circulation.  Part shade is better than full shade.  Container plants grown as houseplants should be placed near sunny windows but not in direct sun.  Foliage may scorch in full sun but growth will lose vigor in too much shade.  Water freely and evenly, but avoid overwatering.  Soils should never be allowed to dry out.  Mist foliage to increase humidity.  Best indoor daytime temperatures are around 70 degrees F., dipping to 60 degrees F. at night.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as rough maidenhair fern, is an evergreen to deciduous fern featuring bipinnate to tripinnate fronds (each to 14” long).  It typically grows in an arching foliage clump to 12-18” tall, spreading over time by wiry, short-creeping rhizomes to form small colonies.  Each frond is divided into narrow pinnae stemming from the center stem of the frond, with each pinna being clad with rough textured, oblong to fan-shaped, medium to dark green pinnules (leaf segments to 1/2” long).  Each pinnule has sori (spores) which appear in summer on the undermargins of the pinnules (6-14 sori per pinnule). This fern is native to shaded rainforest and open rocky sites, often found along rivers and banks, in Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands, tropical Asia and Africa.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the southern U. S. (Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Hawaii).  This fern tends to be deciduous when grown outdoors in temperate conditions of USDA Zones 8-10, but is semi-evergreen to evergreen when grown in semi-tropical to tropical conditions or indoors as a houseplant.  Juvenile foliage emerges showy pink in sharp contrast to the leathery dark green mature foliage, hence the sometimes used additional common name of rosy maidenhair fern.  Pink fronds gradually mature to dark green or bronze green.  Common name of rough maidenhair fern is in reference to its rough-textured foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin hispus meaning hair in reference to the fronds having minutely hairy stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaves may scorch in direct sun.  Rhizome rot may occur in wet soils.  At the other extreme, fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.  Watch for aphids, mealybugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
This is a popular ornamental fern which may be grown outdoors in USDA Zones 8-10 (perhaps Zone 7 if mulched and sheltered in winter) in shaded areas of woodland gardens and/or in containers/hanging baskets in shaded patio areas.  North of Zone 8, it is usually grown indoors as a houseplant.

Culture
Agapanthus is best grown in tubs or containers in the St. Louis area (Zone 6) where it is not winter hardy. Although Agapanthus hybrids are mostly winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10, some of the deciduous hybrids may be grown in the ground year-round as far north as Zone 6. These are tender perennials that grow from fleshy-rooted rhizomes. For container plants, plant rhizome 1/2"" below soil surface, keep soils consistently moist and provide moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer). Plants bloom best when roots are pot-bound. Site containers in locations with afternoon shade. In fall prior to the first frost, remove containers to a bright, frost-free location for overwintering. Provide very limited water in winter (for evergreen types, provide just enough water to keep leaves from drying/wilting). Return containers outdoors in spring.'Blue Yonder' offers improved cold hardiness compared to other Agapanthus hybrids.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agapanthus, commonly called lily of the Nile, is native to South Africa (not the Nile River as the misleading common name suggests). It produces rounded clusters (umbels) of funnel-shaped flowers atop stiff, upright, leafless, fleshy stalks (scapes) rising above a dense mound of basal narrow, strap-shaped, linear, grass-like leaves. Blooms in summer. Hybrids come in a variety of colors (dark purples to blues to whites) and in sizes ranging from dwarf plants (18"" tall) to large cultivars (to 4' tall). Leaves may be evergreen or deciduous. Leaves of some cultivars are variegated. Foliage mounds are generally attractive when plants are not in bloom.Genus name comes from the Greek words agape meaning love and anthos meaning flower.'Blue Yonder'  features dense clusters of bright blue, tubular flowers held atop sturdy, 3' tall flowering stalks. Excellent cut flower.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache foeniculum, commonly known as anise hyssop, is an upright, clump-forming perennial of the mint family that is native to parts of the upper Midwest and Great Plains (Wisconsin to Ontario west to British Columbia and south to Colorado). It is typically found in prairies, dry upland forested areas, plains and fields. It grows to 2-4' tall. It is noted for its mid- to late summer bloom of lavender to purple flowers in terminal spikes and its anise-scented foliage. Square stems are clad with ovate to broad-lanceolate dull green leaves (to 4"" long) with toothed margins. Flowers appear in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) which are densely packed into showy, cylindrical, terminal flower spikes (3-6"" long). Gaps sometimes appear along the flower spike. Individual, tiny, tubular, two-lipped flowers (each to 1/3"" long) have no fragrance. Flowers are attractive to bees (good nectar plant), hummingbirds and butterflies. Aromatic leaves can be used to make herbal teas or jellies. Seeds can be added to cookies or muffins. Dried leaves can be added to potpourris.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.Specific epithet comes from a Latin meaning hay.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave americana is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to Mexico.  It has been introduced and has naturalized in a number of tropical areas around the world.  Each plant typically forms a large, evergreen basal rosette of thick, succulent, lanceolate, gray-green leaves.  Each rosette typically matures over time to as much as 6' tall by 8-10' wide.  Each leaf has a waxy bloom, spiny tip, and sharp marginal spines.  This plant is also well-known for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Plants are monocarpic (bloom only once and then die).  Common name of century plant suggests the plant will live 100 years before flowering.  In reality, outdoor plants typically bloom between the 10th and 25th years.   Indoor plants rarely flower.  When an outdoor plant blooms, it sends up a single, stout, erect flowering stalk from the center of the basal rosette of leaves to 15-30' tall or more.  The flowering stalk resembles a narrow telephone pole with horizontal branching near the top.  Greenish-yellow flowers (each to 3-4"" long) bloom in panicles at the branch ends.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of each rosette over time, often forming a colony of new plants.  Once a plant flowers and dies, the offsets around the base of the plant continue to grow.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet means of America.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this agave serves as an interesting tropical accent or specimen.   It is a large and showy plant for the landscape.  It needs a large space in which to grow.  Plants are often grown in cactus or succulent garden areas.  It will grow well in containers as an indoor plant at a much smaller size.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers rich soils with good drainage and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Plants tend to wilt quickly if soils are allowed to dry out. Tolerates light shade, and prefers some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. In climates where powdery mildew is a problem, avoid overhead watering and site in areas with good air circulation. Ageratums are easily grown from seed. Seed may be started indoors in late winter and transplanted outdoors after threat of frost has passed. Seed may also be sown directly in the garden after last frost date, however flowering season will be shorter (late summer to frost). Seeds are tiny and difficult to work with, particularly for direct outdoor plantings. For gardeners who do not wish to use seed, live plants are available from many nurseries in cell packs/six packs and flats. Space taller varieties 12” apart and shorter varieties 6” apart. Spent flowers will fall to the ground as they fade to be replaced by new bloom throughout the growing season. Prompt deadheading of the faded flowers is not necessary, but keeps a planting tidy and tends to promote a better uninterrupted bloom. Plants may not bloom to frost in some hot summer climates, but usually do so in cooler ones. First autumn frost will kill most if not all plants, at which point they may be removed from the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ageratum houstonianum, commonly called floss flower, is a frost-tender annual of the aster family that provides continuous bloom for beds, gardens or containers from late spring to frost. Features fluffy flowers (basically asters with ray flowers absent) in flattened to slightly rounded clusters atop compact, mounded plants generally ranging from 4” to 18” tall. Some taller varieties (e.g., the triploid ‘Blue Horizon’) are more erect and grow to as much as 30” tall. Species flowers are medium blue, however many cultivars are available in commerce in various shades of blue, pink, red, white and bicolor. Leaves are typically rounded, cordate-at-the-base, hairy, slightly quilted and soft green. Taller varieties make good cut flowers.Genus name presumably comes from the Greek a meaning not and geras meaning old age  because the flowers hold their color for a long time.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids and whiteflies. Powdery mildew is an occasional problem, particularly in hot and humid climates where soils are kept on the dry side and air circulation is poor. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Taller plants usually benefit from some support.
","
Garden Uses
Shorter varieties are excellent as bedding plants, edgers (along paths, walkways and border fronts) and container plants (hanging baskets, window boxes, urns or other containers). Also effective in rock gardens. Taller varieties are appropriate for mid-borders or cutting gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade, but tolerates close to full shade.  Prefers part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Performs well in moist garden areas. Freely self-seeds in the garden to the point of being somewhat invasive in optimum growing conditions.  Prompt removal of spent flower stems will not only prevent self-seeding but may also encourage a sparse, late summer rebloom.  Plants may be grown from seed started indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  Divide plants as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alchemilla mollis, commonly known as lady’s mantle, is a clumping perennial which typically forms a basal foliage mound (6-12” tall ) of long-stalked, circular, scallop-edged, toothed, pleated, soft-hairy, light green leaves (to 6” across) each with 9-11 shallow rounded lobes.  It is primarily native to mountain areas in eastern Europe (Carpathians, Caucusus and Turkey).  Tiny, apetalous, star-shaped, chartreuse flowers appear in loose, spreading clusters (compound cymes) atop stems rising above the foliage to 12-18” in late spring to early summer.  The tendency of plant leaves to retain moisture beads after a rain is considered to be a unique and attractive ornamental feature.Origin uncertain, perhaps the Latinized version of an Arabic name.Specific epithet means soft.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be an aggressive self-seeder. In hot summer climates such as St. Louis, leaves may scorch in full sun exposures or if soils are permitted to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Border fronts.  Cottage gardens.  Edging for paths.  Mass as ground cover.  Flowers may be cut at the peak of bloom and hung up to dry in a dark room for future use in dried flower arrangements.

Culture
Tropical evergreen vine or shrub that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Best flowering in full sun. Best performance occurs in hot and humid climates where nighttime temperatures do not dip below 60 degrees F. In St. Louis, this plant is grown as an annual or in containers or greenhouses. Container plants must be brought inside before first frost and overwintered as houseplants in large sunny rooms with intense bright light and moderate humidity or in a greenhouse. When grown as a vine, it must be trained to grow on a support structure because it does not twine or have tendrils/aerial roots. May also be pruned to grow as a shrub. Thin stems to promote air circulation if fungal diseases attack the foliage. Can be difficult to grow as a houseplant due to large size.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Native to Brazil, golden trumpet or common allamanda is a frost-tender, evergreen, tropical plant that is primarily grown as a climbing vine, but may also be pruned as a shrub. As a vine, it will grow rapidly to 20’. Features clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped, single or double flowers with white throat markings and leathery, wavy-margined, obovate, light green leaves (4-6” long) that appear in whorls of 3-4 or in pairs along the stems. Blooms throughout the summer to first frost. As with most dogbane family members, the stems exude a toxic milky sap.Genus name is in honor of Swiss botanist Frederik Allamand (b. about 1735, d. after 1776).Specific epithet means purgative.

Plants will naturalize by self-seeding and bulb offsets in optimum growing conditions. Deadhead flowers before seed sets to help control any unwanted spread. Foliage persists past flowering into late summer before dying back. Plants are easily grown from seed which should be planted in spring or from bulbs/bulb offsets which should be planted in autumn.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium cernuum, commonly called nodding wild onion, is a Missouri native plant which occurs primarily in rocky soils on glades, bluff edges, open woods and slopes in the Ozark region of the State. Plants typically grow 12-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12” tall) and tiny bell-shaped, pink to lilac pink (occasionally white) flowers which appear in loose, nodding clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Wild nodding onion is distinguished from most other native alliums by the fact that its scapes crook sharply downward at the top just below the flower so that the flower umbel nods (hence the common name). Blooms in summer. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, nodding onion is not generally considered to be of culinary value today.

Specific epithet means nodding.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means nodding.

Best in full sun, but appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Tolerates a wide range of soils.  Although this allium is a true bulb (albeit weakly developed) on a rhizome, it forms a clump which can be lifted and divided somewhat easily in either spring or fall.  It will spread in the landscape by short fleshy rhizomes or by self-seeding.  Deadheading spent umbels before seed set not only helps control unwanted spread but also helps build a stronger bloom for the following year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium lusitanicum, commonly called mountain garlic, is a bulbous perennial that typically grows to 9-14” tall.  It is native to cliffs, meadows, mountain slopes, dry grasslands and pine forests in Europe (Ukraine to Northern Portugal).  It is synonymous with and formerly known as Allium senescens subsp. montanum.  Allium senescens, its subspecies and varieties are primarily native to Asia except for the within plant which is native to Europe.  This geographically separated European native has now been removed from A. senescens and renamed Allium lusitanicum. 

Each plant typically produces 4-9 linear, grass-like, green leaves (to 1/4” wide) which emit a strong onion-garlic aroma if bruised or crushed.  Leafless, hollow, unbranched flowering scapes rise above the leaves to 14” tall in mid-summer (July-August), each scape topped by a single terminal globose umbel (to 1.25” diameter) bearing tiny pale pink to pinkish-purple florets.  Seeds mature in fall.  Although all parts of this plant have an oniony smell and taste, this species is primarily considered to be an ornamental and is not usually grown for culinary purposes.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet is from Lusitania the old Roman name for Portugal.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clethra tomentosa, commonly called summer sweet, is a deciduous shrub that is native to damp woods, swamps, wet marshes and stream banks, often in sandy soils, in the southeastern U.S. from North Carolina to Florida west to Louisiana.  It is a rounded, suckering, densely-branched shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ (less frequently to 8’) tall.  Young shoots and young leaf surfaces are woolly-tomentose.  It is noted for producing a mid to late summer (mid-July to September) bloom of sweetly fragrant white flowers which appear in drooping, narrow panicles (racemes to 2-6"" long).  Each inflorescence has 2-4 flowering racemes.  Flowers give way to dark brown seed capsules (1/8"" diameter) which may persist into winter.   Mature stems have scaly, dark gray to brownish-black bark.  Serrate, obovate to oblong, glossy dark green leaves (to 3-4” long) turn variable but generally attractive shades of yellow to golden brown in fall.  Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and bees.  Semi-evergreen in warm winter climates.  

Clethra tomentosa was formerly listed as Clethra alnifolia var. tomentosum, but has somewhat recently been elevated to separate species status.   On a comparative basis, the characteristics of Clethra alnifolia var. tomentosum which were primarily considered in changing its listing to Clethra tomentosum include:  (1) flowers panicles are longer and more drooping, (2) petioles are consistently shorter, (3) new shoots are woolly, (4) styles are shorter and hairy, and (5) overall growth habit is more spreading.Genus name comes from the Greek klethra the name for alder of which the leaves resemble.Specific epithet from Latin means hairy in reference to the hairs found on the leaves and young shoots of this plant.‘Cottondale’ leaves are more tomentose than the species, thus lending a blue-green cast to upper surfaces and a light green cast to leaf undersides.  Flower racemes are longer than those of the species, typically extending to as much as 16” long”.  This cultivar was discovered growing in the Florida panhandle and was subsequently introduced into cultivation by Woodlanders.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Spider mites may be a concern in dry conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Summer sweets are somewhat unique among flowering shrubs because of their ability to bloom in shady locations in late summer when few other shrubs are in bloom.  Mass or group in lawns, foundations or shrub borders.  Good flowering shrub for shade or woodland gardens.  Effective as a hedge.  Also appropriate for moist soils along stream banks or pond/water garden peripheries.  Also may be naturalized in cottage gardens, wild gardens or naturalized areas.  Plant near a patio to enjoy the fragrant late summer bloom.  Compact size makes this an ideal flowering shrub for smaller gardens.

It is a woody shrub that produces shiny lanceolate green leaves (to 3-4” long) that have a strong aroma (without crushing) and taste of lemon. Leaves are opposite or in whorls of three (hence the specific epithet). Plants will grow to 10-15’ tall in the tropics, but to 2-4’ tall in containers. Fragrant, white to pale lilac flowers bloom from mid-summer to early fall, but have little ornamental significance. Container plants may not bloom. Plants are evergreen in tropical/warm winter locations but deciduous in areas where freezing temperatures occur. Lemon verbena has been a popular garden plant in warm southern and western parts of the U.S. for many years. Leaves are strongest at the time of flowering. Leaves and flowers are used for culinary purposes (teas, desserts, fruit salads and jams) for perfumes and cosmetics, for potpourris and as herbal medicines (colds, fevers, dyspepsia and diarrhea). Aloysia citriodora is synonymous with Aloysia triphylla, Lippia citriodora, Verbena citriodora and Verbena triphylla. Spanish explorers brought this plant to Spain in the 17th century at which point it was named after Princess Louisa of Parma (genus name is a version of Louisa and common name is Herb Louisa).Genus name honors Maria Louisa (d. 1819), princess of Parma and wife of King Carlos IV of Spain.Specific epithet means lemon-scented.

Best grown in organically rich, medium to wet, well-drained soils in part shade. Tolerates close to full shade. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-11. In St. Louis, this plant is generally grown as a houseplant or in the greenhouse. As a houseplant, it must have bright light and humid conditions. Remove flowering canes after bloom. Prune as needed to control plant size. Plants will not flower until the second year, so if grown as annuals they are generally only enjoyed for their foliage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia japonica is native to China, central and southern Japan and Taiwan. It is a rhizomatous, evergreen, tropical perennial that grows in upright leafy clumps to 2-2.5’ tall. Distinguished from other members of the ginger family by the fact that its flowers droop from the ends of leafy stems rather than rise directly from plant rhizomes. White tubular flowers with red striping appear in spike-like inflorescences in summer. Lance-shaped green leaves to 1.5’ long and 3” wide are glabrous above and pubescent below. Leaves and flowers are attractive in flower arrangements.Genus name honors Italian botanist Prospero Alpino (1553-1616).Specific epithet means of Japan.

Culture
Tropical perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zone 10 and is grown exclusively for its colorful foliage. Best grown in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage colors are developed in full sun. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. In the St. Louis area, it is typically grown outdoors as an annual, but may also be grown indoors as a houseplant as long as it is sited in a bright, sunny location and soils are kept moist. Plants may be grown from seed by starting them indoors in late winter and transplanting them outdoors after last frost date. Quality of leaf color may vary considerably and only the best seedlings should be selected for inclusion in the planting. Pinching stems or shearing will keep plants compact and bushy. For those who do not wish to plant seed, some of the more popular varieties are available from nurseries in cell packs or flats. Smaller plants may be potted up and brought inside in winter. In the alternative, tip cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering indoors.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alternanthera dentatais native to the West Indies and Brazil. It is a generally upright plant that typically forms spreading foliage mounds to 12-30” tall. Although species plants feature linear-lanceolate to ovate, toothed green leaves (to 3.5” long), it is the purple-leaved cultivars that have become popular garden plants. Foliage is suggestive of coleus. White apetalous flowers appear in small axillary clusters in late fall to winter, but are insignificant. Flowers are usually observed in St. Louis only on houseplants or on container plants brought inside for overwintering. Plants in the genus Alternanthera have a rather large number of descriptive common names, including but not limited to Joseph’s coat, copperleaf, calico plant, bloodleaf, joyweed and parrot leaf, all in reference to the often brilliantly colored leaves which provide foliage contrast to gardens and container plantings. A. dentata cultivars are noted for their rich purple to burgundy leaves.Genus name comes from the Latin words alternans meaning alternating and anthera meaning anther. Alternate anthers in the genus are barren.Specific epithet means toothed for the toothed leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Best flower and subsequent fruit production occur in full sun. Needs a support structure upon which to grow. Flowers on new growth, so this vine may be cut to the ground in late winter (optional) to control growth. Otherwise trim stems as needed to maintain desired shape.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ampelopsis brevipedunculata, commonly called porcelain vine, is a vigorous, woody, deciduous, tendril-climbing vine which is somewhat similar in habit to wild grape vines and will typically grow 15-25'. Features mostly 3-lobed, deep green leaves (to 5"" long). Clusters (cymes) of non-showy, greenish flowers appear in the leaf axils in July. Flowers give way in fall to showy clusters of rounded-to-oval, pale lilac-blue fruits (1/4"" diameter) which mature to brighter and deeper shades of amethyst to porcelain blue.

Var. maximowiczii is not recognized by some authorities (included in the species) and considered a synonym of Ampelopsis glandulosa var. heterophylla by others.Genus name comes from the Greek words ampelos meaning a vine and opsis meaning likeness. It is closely related to grape vines.Specific epithet means with a short flower stalk.'Elegans' has three-lobed leaves that are variegated with white. Young leaves exhibit a pinkish tinge in the spring. Inconspicuous, greenish flowers appear in July and give way to clusters of blue berries in fall. Fruit is initially a pale blue which turns turquoise as it ripens. Fruits attract birds.

In St. Louis, it may be grown indoors in greenhouses, but is difficult to grow as a houseplant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Annona muricata, commonly called soursop (also known as graviola or guanabana), is a small evergreen tropical tree that is native to Central and tropical South America.  In the wild, it is a slender tree that will grow to 15-20' tall often with down-curved branching.  It grows much smaller in containers.  The name soursop is in reference to its large edible fruits which have a slightly acidic or sour taste.  This tropical plant is not reliably winter hardy to most of southern Florida, but may be grown in the Florida keys and Puerto Rico.  In greenhouses, it typically flowers in summer producing fruits in fall.  Each flower (to 2"" long) appears singly on a woody stalk almost anywhere on the tree (twigs, branches or trunk).  Each flower has three yellowish-green outer petals and three dull yellow inner petals.  Flowers give way to rough-skinned, prickly-textured, oblong fruit (each fruit from 6-12"" long to 4-6"" wide with weight to 8-15 pounds).  Fruit pulp is used in ice cream, sherbets or juices.  Leathery, egg-shaped, malodorous (when bruised), oblong to oval leaves (to 6"" long) are glossy green above.  Plants have been used for various medicinal purposes.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the American Indian (Taino) vernacular name for the cherimoya, soursop or custard-apple.

Culture
Short-lived tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10. In St. Louis, it is usually grown as an annual. It is easily grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid overhead watering. Start seeds indoors 6-10 weeks before last frost date or purchase starter plants. Set out plants/seedlings after last frost date. Pinch stem tips of young plants to promote bushiness and prevent leggy growth. Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom. If flowering slows drastically after the first flush of bloom, consider cutting plants back hard and fertilizing. Although well-mulched plants in protected locations may overwinter in St. Louis and although cuttings may be taken in fall for overwintering, snapdragons are inexpensive plants that are perhaps best repurchased each spring. Nurseries commonly sell plants in cell/six packs. Always purchase fungal resistant plants/seeds. Snapdragons, like pansies, are often planted in fall south of USDA Zone 7 where they will not only survive the winter, but will bloom as long as temperatures stay above freezing.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Snapdragons are old garden favorites that, in optimum cool summer growing conditions, will flower well from spring to fall. In climates with protracted hot summer weather, plants often tend to languish and may not last the entire growing season. The common name is in reference to the dragon-shaped, tubular, two-lipped, closed flowers that appear in terminal racemes. Many cultivars and hybrids in which A. majus is a prominent parent are available in commerce. Flowers come in a variety of both pastel shades and bright colors, including some bicolors, in shades of white, yellow, red, pink, orange, peach and purple. Lance shaped, glossy dark green leaves (to 3” long). Cultivars and hybrids generally are classified into three groups based upon height: dwarf plants (8-12” tall), intermediate plants (12-24” tall) and tall plants (24-36” tall).Genus name comes from the Greek words anti meaning like and  rhis meaning a nose or snout in allusion to the appearance of the flower which looks like a dragon's snout.‘Dulcinea’s Heart’ is a hybrid perennial snapdragon that is winter hardy to USDA Zone 5. It is a cross between Antirrhinum braun-blanquettii and Antirrhinum majus. Although common snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus) are grown in St. Louis as annuals, this new hybrid will survive winter. Plants typically grow to 15” tall and feature dragon-shaped, tubular, two-lipped, yellow and apricot flowers in terminal racemes. Flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, with a repeat bloom in late summer. Lance shaped, glossy dark green leaves (to 3” long).
","
Problems
Rust can be a significant problem. If rust does appear in a planting, it is best to grow snapdragons in another part of the garden the following year. Also susceptible to mold, fungal leaf spots, downy mildew, wilt and root rots. Watch for aphids. Tall plants may need support when young until such time as they bush out.
","
Garden Uses
Dwarf varieties are best for beds, border fronts, edgings, window boxes and other containers. Intermediate varieties are best for bedding and mixed borders. Tall plants are best for borders and cutting gardens.This snapdragon will survive winters in St. Louis.

Culture
Easily grown in average, evenly moist, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates a wide range of soils except heavy, poorly-drained ones.  Prefers organically rich, moist soils with light to moderate shade.  Remove flowering stems after bloom to encourage additional bloom.  Keep soils uniformly moist after bloom to prolong attractive foliage appearance. When foliage depreciates, plants may be cut to the ground.  It should be noted that seed collected from garden plants or self-seeded plants may not come true because different varieties of columbine may cross-pollinate in the garden producing seed that is at variance with either or both parents.Biedermeier plants may be grown from seed, may self-seed in the garden and may naturalize in the garden over time.  Seed is commercially sold in flower color mixes or by individual flower color.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aquilegia is a genus of about 70 species of herbaceous perennials from the Northern Hemisphere.Genus name comes from the Latin word for eagle in reference to the flower’s five spurs which purportedly resemble an eagle’s talon.Common name of granny's bonnet is in reference to the spreading bonnet-like appearance of the flower petals.The Biedermeier Group are a mix of compact, low-growing, columbine plants.  This strain contains four separate pastel-colored spurred flowers in colors of pink, red, blue and white.  These are bushy, clump-forming perennials that typically grow in a mound of thin, branching, leafy stems to 12"" tall.  They are noted for having a glorious spring bloom (April-May in St. Louis) of spurred flowers.  Biternate, medium green, basal leaves are glabrous above and glaucous beneath.  Upper leaves are divided into lobed leaflets that are usually three-lobed at the tips.
","
Problems
Susceptible to leaf miner.  Aphids are a lesser problem.  Potential disease problems include leaf spot, powdery mildew and rust. Foliage usually declines by mid-summer at which point it should be cut to the ground.
","
Garden Uses
Borders, rock gardens, cottage gardens, open shade gardens, woodland gardens or naturalized areas.   Also a good selection for a hummingbird garden.  Continue to water plants after bloom to enjoy the ground cover effect of the foliage.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. When grown outdoors, this tree prefers deep, porous, moderately fertile, reasonably moist soils in full sun.  Tolerant of some dry soil conditions however.   Also tolerant of windy conditions.   May be grown from seed sown in moist, sandy, peaty soils, but seed-grown trees typically have widely-spaced tiers of leaves that are less ornamentally attractive than the leaves found on trees raised from terminal cuttings.  Best growth generally occurs in sub-tropical regions.  

For indoor use, this tree may be grown in containers or tubs in fertile, porous, sandy, peaty, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in fairly cool conditions (55-65 degrees F).  Full sun is normally best for developing compact symmetrical growth, but some light afternoon shade may be needed to avoid possible foliage bleach (yellow tints).  As a houseplant, it will generally adapt to the warm, dry atmosphere found in most offices and homes.  Consider weekly or biweekly applications of dilute liquid fertilizer from spring through fall.  Avoid soils that are too wet or too dry.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Norfolk Island pine is a pyramidal to columnar, coniferous, evergreen tree with a symmetrical form that features whorled, horizontal branches (typically 5 branches per whorl) in tiers radiating outward from a strong, single, upright trunk.  Secondary branches in two rows spread horizontally or droop slightly.  It is native to Norfolk Island off the coast of Australia where it typically grows on basalt sea cliffs and interior rain forests, sometimes reaching majestic heights of 200’ or more with trunk diameters to 6’ or more.  It was discovered on Captain Cook’s second voyage (1772-1775), and was subsequently introduced into cultivation in 1793.  It is now widely planted throughout the world in subtropical regions, often in coastal areas.  It is common in Hawaii, parts of southern Florida and parts of southern California up the coast to the San Francisco Bay area. 

Needle-like, awl-shaped juvenile leaves (each to 1/2” long) have incurved sharp-pointed ends.  Scale-like adult leaves (each to 1/4” long) are lanceolate to ovate-triangular, overlap each other and are closely arranged along the shoots pointing toward the shoot ends.  Cylindrical male pollen cones grow to 2” long.  Nearly globular, spiny-scaled, female seed cones grow to 3-6” in diameter. 

Norfolk Island Pine is now the most popular species in the genus in North America where it is commonly grown in pots and tubs as a decorative indoor plant. 

In St. Louis, it is grown as a container/tub plant, typically in the 3-6’ tall range.  It grows slowly, and in proper growing conditions has a long life.  It looks like a pine with horizontal needle-like branches, but it is not part of the pine genus.Genus name comes from the Araucanian Indians of central Chile to whose territory Araucaria is native.Specific epithet comes from Greek meaning variously leaved.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aronia arbutifolia, commonly called red chokeberry, is a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub that is native to both wet and dry thickets in Eastern North America (Nova Scotia and Ontario to Ohio south to Texas and Florida). It typically grows in a vase-shaped form to 6-10’ tall and to 3-6' wide, but tends to sucker and form colonies. Clusters (corymbs) of white to light pink, 5-petaled flowers (1/3”diameter) appear in spring. Flowers are followed by abundant glossy red fruits (1/4” diameter) which appear in dense clusters along the branches. Fruits ripen in late summer and persist on the shrub throughout fall and well into winter. Elliptic to oblong to obovate leaves (to 3 1/2” long) are glossy dark green above and pubescent grayish-green beneath. Foliage turns bright red in autumn and compares favorably with burning bush (Euonymus alatus) for excellence of fall color. Fruits are sometimes used to make tasty jams and jellies. Aronia arbutifolia is synonymous with Pyrus arbutifolis and Photinia pyrifolia.Genus name comes from the Greek word aria  the name for a species of Sorbus of which the fruits resemble chokeberry.Specific epithet means having leaves like Arbutus.Common name is in reference to the tart and bitter berries which are technically edible but are so astringent as to cause choking in those who try.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spots and twig/fruit blight.
","
Garden Uses
Group or mass in shrub borders or woodland areas. Ability to withstand wet conditions makes it suitable for growing on the margins of ponds or streams.

Dividing the clumps every 3-4 years will help keep plants robust, but replacement of the plants should be considered if plant vitality declines. Since any seed produced is generally sterile, French tarragon should be propagated by cuttings or division. Fresh leaves may be harvested at any time for cooking. Leaves may also be dried for later use by cutting the leafy stems in mid-summer and hanging them in bunches in a cool, dry location. Dried leaves should then be stored in airtight containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia dracunculus, commonly called wild tarragon, is a polymorphic species that is native to temperate Europe and Asia.  It is also found in western North America, though many of these populations may have resulted from introduction and naturalization.  It produces viable seed and will often self-seed.  Its leaves produce variable flavor and aroma, sometimes lacking both flavor and aroma.  It has a long history of medicinal uses, but the species is not often used for culinary purposes.  It is a rhizomatous perennial or sub-shrub that typically grows to 24” (less frequently to 36”) tall on generally erect stems clad with narrow, linear to lance-shaped, light to medium green leaves (to 3-4” long). Greenish white flowers in narrow elongated panicles bloom in summer.  

Tarragon sold under the species name without reference to cultivar or variety may be the less pungent Russian tarragon, which is considered by most cooks to be significantly inferior for culinary use. See A. d. 'Sativa' for information on French tarragon.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is a Latin word meaning a small dragon.'Sativa' or Artemisia dracunculus var. sativa is commonly called French tarragon and is commonly used as a culinary herb. It is noted for the pungent anise-like flavor and aroma of its leaves. It is a shrubby perennial which typically grows 18-24"" (less frequently to 36"") tall on generally erect, leafy stems and slowly spreads by creeping rhizomes. Its narrow, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 3"" long) may be used fresh or dried to add flavoring to fish, meats, vegetables, eggs, salads, sauces or vinegars. It is the primary flavoring in béarnaise sauce. French tarragon rarely produces seeds and those produced are usually sterile (plants must be propagated by stem cuttings or division).
","
Problems
Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.  French tarragon does not always survive St. Louis winters, and wet soils in winter is a common cause of plant demise.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Best grown in poor to moderately fertile, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Excellent soil drainage is essential for growing this plant well. Plants perform poorly in moist to wet soils where they are susceptible to root rot. Plant stems tend to lodge in summer, especially if grown in fertile soils and/or part shade. General foliage decline commonly occurs in high humidity summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Consider pinching back stems in late spring to reduce mature plant height. If foliage declines or stems flop in summer, plants may be sheared to revitalize. Plants may spread somewhat aggressively in the garden by rhizomes and by self-seeding. Prompt removal of flower heads as they appear prevents self-seeding. Soil barriers may be considered to help contain rhizomatous spread.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia ludoviciana is native throughout North America from Canada to Mexico. In Missouri, it is typically found growing on rocky prairies, glades, bluff escarpments, open wooded slopes, waste ground, along roads and railroads primarily in the northern and western parts of the State (Steyermark). It is commonly called white sage because of the appearance of its foliage. This is an erect, rhizomatous, somewhat weedy, herbaceous perennial that grows in spreading clumps to 2-3' (less frequently to 4') tall on greenish white stems clad with aromatic, sage-like, lance-shaped leaves (to 2-4” long) that are white woolly beneath and nearly glabrous above. Foliage adds texture and contrast to gardens. Tiny, somewhat inconspicuous, yellowish-gray, discoid flower heads (rays absent) appear in dense panicles at the stem ends in summer. Flowers have little ornamental value. Flowers give way to dry achenes. Foliage is aromatic when bruised.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is in reference to the Louisiana Territory.'Silver Frost' is a compact cultivar which features stems and leaves that are silvery-white and pubescent. It is a generally upright perennial that is grown for its attractive foliage which adds contrast to gardens.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia abrotanum, commonly called southernwood, is a perennial sub-shrub that typically grows on woody, upright-branching stems to form a 3-4’ tall bushy mound of ferny, strongly aromatic, medium to light green leaves, each of which is 1-3 times pinnately dissected into threadlike segments.  Southernwood is native to southern Europe, most likely in countries along the Mediterranean from Spain to Italy.  It was introduced into the eastern U.S. in the early 1600s, and has naturalized over time into parts of the northeast primarily in disturbed sites (fields, roadsides, and waste areas).  It is semi-evergreen in frost-free winter climates, but deciduous in cold winter locations.  Although once planted as both a culinary herb and a medicinal herb, it is primarily grown in gardens today for its attractive ornamental foliage augmented by its pleasant citrus to camphor-like foliage fragrance.  Leaves retain good fragrance after drying, hence their use in sachets, as air fresheners and for discouraging clothing moths.  This plant flowers infrequently in eastern North America.  When flowering does occur, nodding yellowish-white flowers (each to 3/16” across) bloom in loose panicles from late August into October.  Flowers are not particularly showy.  In the northern parts of its growing range, seeds often do not reach maturity for this late-bloomer prior to the onset of cold weather.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet from Greek means wormwood or southernwood.This plant has acquired a large number of additional common names over time including lad’s love, maid’s love or old man.  French name for this plant is garderobe meaning guard the wardrobe in recognition of the practice of placing plant sprigs in closets or clothing drawers to deter moths.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias incarnata, commonly called swamp milkweed, is an erect, clump-forming, Missouri native plant which is commonly found in swamps, river bottomlands and wet meadows throughout the State. It typically grows 3-4' tall (less frequently to 5') on branching stems. Small, fragrant, pink to mauve flowers (1/4"" wide), each with five reflexed petals and an elevated central crown, appear in tight clusters (umbels) at the stem ends in summer. Flowers are uncommonly white. Narrow, lance-shaped, taper-pointed leaves are 3-6"" long. Stems exude a toxic milky sap when cut. Flowers are followed by attractive seed pods (to 4"" long) which split open when ripe releasing silky-haired seeds easily carried by the wind. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies as a nectar source. In addition, swamp milkweed is an important food source (albeit somewhat less important than upland species of Asclepias) for the larval stage of Monarch butterflies.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means flesh-colored.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias purpurascens, commonly called purple milkweed, is a rough, weedy, Missouri native perennial that commonly occurs in dry to moist open woods, dry ridge tops, thickets, glades, prairie openings, stream banks and wet meadows throughout most of the state (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to common milkweed (A. syriaca), except its flowers are deep rose pink and its leaves are more pointed. It typically grows 2-3’ tall on stout, upright stems with heavy, pointed, short-stalked, ovate to oblong-lanceolate, opposite leaves (to 8” long). Leaves are dark green above and slightly pubescent below. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Tiny, deep rose-pink flowers appear in many-flowered umbels in May-July. Each tiny flower (to 3/4” long) has 5 reflexed petals and 5 purple heads. Flowers give way to smooth seed pods (to 6” long) which split open when ripe releasing their numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars).Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means purple.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias hirtella, commonly known as tall green milkweed or prairie milkweed, is an upright herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 3’ tall on one or more unbranched stems.  This is an uncommon species that is native to upland prairies, rocky glades, sandy wetland margins, roadsides, pastures and abandoned fields from Ontario and Minnesota south to Kansas, Louisiana and Georgia.  

Most milkweed plants (Asclepias genus) are noted for their unique and complicated flower structure, the thick milky juice which oozes from broken stems and leaves, their long pointed seedpods, and the almost magnetic attractiveness of their flowers to visiting butterflies and moths.  

Alternate leaves (to 2-6” long) of tall green milkweed (most milkweed species have opposite leaves) have a very narrow-linear to linear-lanceolate shape.  

Rounded, almost spherical, 2-inch diameter umbels, each containing 30-100 tiny, purple-tinged-greenish-white flowers (to 1/8” across), develop in the middle to upper leaf axils in late June-August.  Each individual flower has 5 sepals (lobed calyx), 5 petals (lobed corolla), and 5 upright cup-like hoods (horns absent).  The reflexed 5-lobed corolla curves backward and downward toward the center of the umbel, displaying the 5 hoods which are in general a key diagnostic feature of milkweed family plants.  Flowers are followed by smooth narrow seedpods (4-5” long) which split open when ripe to release numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind.   

Tall green milkweed is distinguished from many of the other species of milkweed by its narrow alternate leaves, greenish-white flower umbels, absence of horns in the flower hoods, and its very floriferous bloom.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means rather hairy.Common names are in reference to plant size and typical habitat.

It should be noted that the monarch butterfly, possibly the best known butterfly in North America, needs milkweed plants in order to survive.  Monarchs migrate into the U.S. from Mexico in spring to lay their eggs on milkweed species plants.  Caterpillars hatch from the eggs and consume the milkweed plant foliage as food for growth and development.  Mature caterpillars next spin a chrysalis which hangs on a milkweed stem until it later emerges, through the miracle of metamorphosis, as an adult butterfly.   Flower nectar is consumed by adult butterflies as a valuable food source.  The adult butterfly eventually migrates into Mexico for winter.  Recent significant declines in monarch butterfly populations in North America are believed by many experts to be related to a corresponding significant decline in milkweed plants which in large part has been caused by an increased use of glyphosate herbicides around food crop areas where glyphosate-tolerant (Roundup Ready) crops are being grown.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Drought tolerant. Does well in poor, dry soils. New growth tends to emerge late in the spring. Plants are easily grown from seed, but are somewhat slow to establish and may take 2-3 years to produce flowers. Mature plants may freely self-seed in the landscape if seed pods are not removed prior to splitting open. Butterfly weed does not transplant well due to its deep taproot, and is probably best left undisturbed once established.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias tuberosa, commonly called butterfly weed, is a tuberous rooted, Missouri native perennial which occurs in dry/rocky open woods, glades, prairies, fields and roadsides throughout the State (Steyermark). It typically grows in a clump to 1-3' tall and features clusters (umbels) of bright orange to yellow-orange flowers atop upright to reclining, hairy stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Unlike many of the other milkweeds, this species does not have milky-sapped stems. Flowers give way to prominent, spindle-shaped seed pods (3-6"" long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Long bloom period from late spring throughout the summer. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars). Also commonly called pleurisy root in reference to a prior medicinal use of the plant roots to treat lung inflammations.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means tuberous in reference to the roots.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11.  Plants can be grown outdoors year round as long as temperatures never dip below 20-25 degrees F.  Plants perform best in organically rich, consistently moist but well drained soils in part shade (bright indirect light or filtered sun).  Avoid direct hot afternoon sun which may cause the leaves to yellow.  Tolerates full shade, but foliage may turn a lighter green.  Plants may die to the ground in light freezes, but roots remain hardy to about 20-25 degrees F.  North of Zone 9, plants can be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors.  Asparagus fern is easily grown as a houseplant in the St. Louis area because it tolerates a wide range of temperatures, does not require high humidity and is easily pruned.  It is best grown with a well-drained, peaty potting mixture.  Water regularly from spring to autumn.  It does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering over the winter months.  Performs well with regular temperatures in summer and minimum 50F temperatures in winter.  This plant is often taken outside for the growing season and brought back inside in early fall.  Pinch back stem tips as needed to maintain plant form and promote dense foliage growth.  If plant loses its attractive shape, stems may be cut back close to the soil level to regenerate.  Propagate by seed or division (separate tubers).  Birds eat the berries and help spread the seed to new locations where the seed will often readily sprout.  Self-seeding can be mildly invasive in some subtropical to tropical areas (e.g., southern Florida and Hawaii).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asparagus densiflorus, commonly called asparagus fern, is noted for its dense fern-like foliage which forms an arching mound that matures to 1-3’ tall spreading to 3-4’ wide.  It is not a fern, however, but is a member of the asparagus family. It is native primarily to coastal areas in the southeastern part of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.  It has escaped cultivation and naturalized in southern Florida where it has spread in a mildly invasive fashion.  This ornamental asparagus is an evergreen perennial with outward-sprawling fibrous and tuberous roots from which rise numerous semi-stiff arching stems (to 24” long) covered with linear, needle-like green leaves (.75 to 1” long).  Technically, the stems contain true leaves (tiny, inconspicuous and scale-like) and larger leaf-like phylloclades which have the form and function of leaves.  Tiny, inconspicuous, pea-like, fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.  Flowers are followed by small red berries which ripen by fall.  Plants have thorns, but the thorns are so small as to be often not noticed. This plant is also sometimes listed as Protasparagus densiflorus because plants in the genus Asparagus (e.g., the edible vegetable A. officinalis) have rhizomes but this plant does not.  Species plants are not as widely grown in gardens as are certain popular cultivars such as ‘Myersii’ (foxtail fern) and Sprengeri group (emerald fern).Genus name is the classical name of this plant.Specific epithet is in reference to the dense flowers along the stem and/or to the dense foliage.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where plants may be grown outside in the ground in warm, bright but shady locations in humus-rich, moist but well-drained soils with added leaf mold, sand and grit.  Avoid direct sun.  Ferns grown outside prefer minimum temperatures of 50 degrees F., but will usually tolerate occasional brief temperature dips into the high 30s.  

In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant.  It performs best in a porous, well-drained, peaty potting mixture in bright filtered light.  Avoid direct sun or dense shade locations.  It does best in warm, moderately bright areas of the home, but tolerates some shade.  Grows well in bright north-facing windows.  Keep soils uniformly moist.  Fairly high humidity is needed, which is a condition that can sometimes be difficult to achieve indoors in winter.  Good plant sites include humidified areas, bathrooms or atop wet-pebbled trays.  Avoid handling the somewhat delicate fronds.  Indoor plants generally seem to have less tolerance for temperatures that dip below 50 degrees F. than plants grown in the ground outdoors.  Ideal indoor temperatures are 60-70 degrees F. with a minimum of 55 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asplenium nidus, commonly called bird’s nest fern, is a slow-growing, epiphytic fern of the spleenwort family featuring simple, entire, strap-shaped, glossy, bright apple green fronds with contrasting dark brown to black midribs and undulating margins.  Fronds spread upward and outward to form a vase-shaped, green rosette with a nest-like center (albeit memorialized by some as resembling a bird’s nest) into which fallen leaves and other organic matter typically accumulate.  Mature fronds on outdoor plants grow to as much as 4-5’ long with a spread to 8” wide, but fronds on indoor container plants typically grow to only 1 1/2'  to 2’ long.  Undersides often display sori (clusters of sporangia) arranged in herringbone fashion in straight black lines from the central mid-rib to the frond margin.   

Species plants are native to tropical areas from Polynesia and Hawaii west to Southeast Asia, Australia, and Madagascar.  They are often found growing on tropical rainforest trees as epiphytes which collect water and organic matter in their bowl-shaped rosettes.Genus name comes from the Greek and means ""without a spleen"", possibly in reference to the believe that certain species of this plant could treat problems of the spleen.Specific epithet means nest in obvious reference to the nest-like structure formed by the rosette of overlapping fronds.Common name of bird’s nest fern is in reference to the aforementioned nest formed by the fronds which arguably resembles a bird’s nest.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs and scale.  Drafts may cause fronds to brown at the edges.  Chemical insecticides will damage plants (use soaps if necessary). Mealybugs.  Bacterial leaf diseases.  Leaf nematode is also common.

Grow in dry, average to sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid heavy clay soils. Rots may develop in moist or poorly-drained soils. Best flowering is in full sun, however plant foliage appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Cut back plants up to 1/2 after flowering to help maintain attractive form. In hot and humid summer climates such as the St. Louis area, this plant is difficult to grow well and can be very short-lived. In the deep South, many gardeners simply grow it in the manner of an annual by planting new plants each fall, enjoying the spring bloom and then removing the plants as the foliage depreciates in summer. New plants are commonly sold in early spring by nurseries. Seed may be planted in the garden in early fall or may be started indoors in late winter from 8-10 weeks before planting outside.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aurinia saxatilis commonly called basket-of-gold is a low-growing, spreading perennial that produces a profuse spring bloom of bright yellow flowers that are particularly attractive in rock gardens, sprawled over rocks or cascaded over rock walls. After bloom, it will remain in the garden as an attractive ground cover unless the foliage depreciates or plants die back from hot summer conditions. It is native from central Europe to Turkey. This is a mat-forming perennial with woody roots that grows to 6-12” tall and features spatulate basal leaves (to 5” long) and smaller linear-oblanceolate stem leaves. Leaves are gray-green. Bright yellow flowers in corymbose panicles bloom in spring. 

Additional common names include yellow alyssum, madwort, goldentuft and gold-dust.

Synonymous with and formerly known as Alyssum saxatile.Genus name comes from the word aureus meaning golden in allusion to the flowers of A. saxatilis (formerly Alyssum saxatile).Specific epithet means found among rocks.‘Dudley Nevill Variegated’ is a cultivar that typically grows to 10” tall and spreads to 18” wide.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Averrhoa carambola, commonly called star fruit is a small, slow-growing, short-trunked tropical tree that probably originated in Malaysia, Indonesia and southern China. It now extinct in the wild. It is grown commercially in many tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world for its unusual fruit. It also serves as an attractive, multi-branched ornamental tree. It typically grows to 20-30' tall with a broad rounded crown featuring odd-pinnate, medium green leaves (to 6-10"" long). Each leaf has 5-11 ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaflets (to 1.5-3.5"" long). Leaflets are sensitive to light and touch, folding up like mimosas in the dark of night or if disturbed. Fragrant rose flowers (1/4"" across) bloom in the leaf axils throughout the year, typically in up to four separate flushes. Flowers give way to waxy, oblong/ellipsoidal, 5-angled, orange/yellow-skinned fruits (3-6"" long) which are star-shaped when sliced in cross-section, hence the common name. Fruit flesh is juicy and ranges from sour to mildly sweet when ripe. Fruits are typically eaten fresh, combined in salads with other fruits, added to dessert dishes or sliced for use as star-shaped garnishes.Genus name comes from the fruit trees named after a celebrated Moorish physician and philosopher Ibn-Ruschd known as Averroes (1126-1198) who was born in Cordoba, Spain.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Baptisia alba commonly called white false indigo, is an upright perennial which typically grows 2-3’ tall and occurs in dry woods from Tennessee and North Carolina to Florida. It features small, white, pea-like flowers (to 1/2” long) in erect racemes (to 12”) atop dark flower stems extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, bluish-green leaves (leaflets to 2” long). Blooms in spring. Flowers give way to inflated seed pods (to 1 3/4” long) which turn brown to black when ripe and have considerable ornamental interest. Stems with seed pods are valued additions to dried flower arrangements.

Baptisia alba var. macrophylla is a Missouri native. It typically grows 2-3' (less frequently to 5') tall and occurs in prairies, open woods, glades, waste areas and along streambanks throughout the State. It is the tallest of the Missouri native baptisias. Features white, lupine-like flowers in erect racemes (to 12"") atop flower spikes extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, bluish-green leaves (leaflets to 3"" long). Variety name means large-leafed. Synonymous with Baptisia leucantha and Baptisia lactea.Genus name comes from the Greek word bapto meaning ""to dye"".Specific epithet means white.The common name of false indigo refers to the use of certain native baptisias by early American colonists as a substitutes, albeit inferior, for true indigo (genus Indigofera) in making dyes.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
False indigo is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to 4-12' (less frequently to 20') tall with a spread often in excess of its height.  It is native to moist open woodland areas, floodplains, stream banks and swamp margins from central to eastern Canada south throughout much of the U. S. into northern Mexico.  It features compound, odd-pinnate leaves (each to 12"" long).  Each leaf contains 11 to 35 spiny-tipped, oval to elliptic, dull gray-green leaflets (to 2"" long) with glandular dots and toothless margins.  Tubular scented flowers (each to 3/8"" long) bloom in May-June in dense, spike-shaped clusters (racemes) to 8"" long.  Each flower has a single-petaled purple corolla and 10 protruding stamens with showy orange-yellow anthers.  Flowers are followed by fruits in small, resinous-dotted, 1-2 seeded pods (to 1/2"" long) which mature in July and August.  This shrub grows much larger than Amorpha canescens (lead plant).Genus name comes from the Greek word amorphos meaning shapeless or deformed in reference to the corolla of this pea family genus lacking wings and a keel.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word frutex meaning shrub in reference to its shrubby form.Plants contain indigo pigment, but in quantities too small for commercial use (hence the common name of false indigo).

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small shrub (or subshrub) is typically found growing along roadsides, slopes, and streambanks, but also in some xeric sites.  Best growth typically occurs in dry to medium moisture well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Although drought tolerant, shrubs prefer moderate but even soil moisture.  Best flowering occurs with regular applications of fertilizer.  Propagate by seed or stem/tip cuttings.  Shrubs self sow in the landscape.  Prune to desired shape.  Cut back stems in spring (sometimes to the ground) to promote a bushy rounded growth.  Shrubs may survive winter in Zone 8, but to facilitate this climate, stems should be cut back to the ground when winter frosts kill the tops, with application of mulch to the root zone for winter (mound of sand covered with a layer of pine straw).  Mulch must be removed in late winter to early spring in anticipation of new growth for the year.  This shrub, even with a quality winter mulch, will not survive temperatures that dip below 20 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Barleria cristata, commonly known as Philippine violet, is a dense, upright, hairy-stemmed, subtropical, evergreen subshrub in the acanthus family that typically matures to 3-4’ tall with a spread to 2-3’ wide.  It is native from northern India and Myanmar (Burma) to southern China and Southeast Asia.  Potential growing areas in the U.S. for this shrub include Florida, southern Louisiana and Texas, southern Arizona and California.  Elliptic to narrow-ovate to oblong leaves (to 4” long and 2” wide) are dark green above and pale green beneath.  Funnel-shaped, 2-inch long flowers (pink, purple, white or mauve with white stripes) bloom in axillary spikes on new growth over a long flowering season from September to December plus mid-spring (May).  Flowers are followed by seedpods.Genus name honors Jacques Barrelier (1606-1673) French botanist and monk.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word cristatus meaning crested or with tassel-like tips.Common name of Philippine violet is a bit of an enigma because, although its flowers are arguably of violet color, the shrub has no relationship to the Philippine Islands or violets.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9b-11.  Best in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Best with moderate but consistent moisture.  Grows well in a variety of soils as long as well-drained.  Thrives in heat but leaves may brown along the edges in dry heat or droughty conditions.  Established trees have respectable drought tolerance, however. Best sited in locations protected from cold winds and frost.  Foliage will suffer damage when temperatures dip below freezing and tree will usually not survive winter temperatures that dip below 26 degrees F.  This is a sterile hybrid (flat seed pods seen on other species are absent) that must be propagated by vegetative cuttings, air layering or grafting onto seedlings of one of the parent species.  All trees in existence are descendants of the hybrids first cultivated at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens, all of which were propagated from the single accidental hybrid first discovered in 1880.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bauhinia x blakeana, commonly known as Hong Kong Orchid Tree, is a small often multi-trunked evergreen to semi-evergreen flowering tree with an umbrella-like shape featuring an irregular rounded crown.  It typically grows to 20’ tall, but occasionally in optimum conditions to as much as 40’ tall.  This hybrid has no native territory as such because it is only known today from trees propagated from a single accidental hybrid discovered in the wild and collected in 1880 near the ruins of a house along the shore of Hong Kong Island near Pok Fu Lam.  Cuttings were taken by a nearby French mission, with subsequent cuttings taken from the mission trees for inclusion at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens.  This hybrid is not only considered to have the best ornamental flowers in the genus but is also considered to be one of the most attractive flowering trees in the world.  Its parents are believed to be B. purpurea x B. variegata.  This hybrid was first botanically described in 1908.  It was chosen as the floral emblem of Hong Kong in 1965.  Its flower image in white became the center of the red Hong Kong flag in 1997.  In the U.S., this tree is frequently cultivated in Hawaii.  It grows well in warm parts of California, Arizona, southern Florida and Texas.  

Fragrant rich rose purple to rose crimson 5-6” wide orchid-like flowers with paler veins bloom over a long late fall to spring (November to April) period.  Each flower has a 5-petaled corolla with the uppermost petal being darker toward the base.  Flowers are shaped like some orchids (to 6” wide).  Flowers of this hybrid are larger than the flowers on species plants.  Bi-lobed, light to medium green leaves have yellowish green veins (6-8”).  Leaves are deeply cleft at the apex and base, producing a twin leaf (butterfly wing) effect.  Trees are partially deciduous (some leaf drop begins to occur in fall around the time flowering begins, but some leaves will persist to varying degrees throughout winter).Genus name honors 16th Century Swiss botanists and herbalists Johann Bauhin and Gaspard Bauhin (i.e., named after identical twins in reference to the bi-lobed leaves unique to genus plants).Hybrid name honors Sir Henry Blake, plant enthusiast and governor of Hong Kong from 1898 to 1903, and his wife Lady Edith Blake.

Houseplants are best grown in relatively small pots with excellent drainage. Plants may be moved outdoors after last spring frost date with gradual adjustment to full sun locations and cooler temperatures. Fading leaves may be peeled off. Brown leaf tips may be clipped off. Outdoors in summer, plants should be given regular water but allowed to dry out between applications. Reduce watering for plants brought indoors for winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Beaucarnea recurvata, commonly called ponytail palm, is an evergreen caudiciform shrub or tree that is native to semi-desert areas of southeastern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala where it typically grows to as much as 30' tall. Where not winter hardy, it is commonly grown as a houseplant that over time will eventually rise to as much as 6-8' tall. Notwithstanding its common name, ponytail palm is not a true palm. It is noted for having a large, swollen, often flask-shaped, water-retaining base (caudex) from which rises a trunk-like stem bearing narrow, flat, palm-like, spreading to recurved leaves (to 6' long but only 1"" wide) that droop fountain-like in clusters from the branch ends. Trunks are usually single with young plants, but several smaller trunks as well as some sparse branching near the top may develop with age. Old plants may produce tiny creamy white flowers in clusters. Flowers rarely appear on houseplants.Genus name is of uncertain origin.Specific epithet means curved backwards.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Houseplants are susceptible to spider mites, mealybug and scale. Potential disease problems include leaf spots, stem rots and bacterial leaf streak.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants prefer part shade in southern areas with hot summers. Plants are intolerant of drought. Although English daisy is a perennial, it is typically grown for ornamental purposes as a biennial in the South or as an annual in the North, with plants being dug up and thrown away after bloom. It is usually grown from seed. In the South (including St. Louis), seed is planted in fall or indoors in winter for bloom the following spring. By the heat of the summer, plants decline to the point where removal becomes appropriate. In the North, seed is planted in early spring for bloom in summer. In cool summer conditions (USDA Zones 4-5 and the West Coast), plants may spread aggressively by spreading crowns and self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bellis perennis, commonly called English daisy, has a varied reputation (depending in large part on geographical location) ranging from attractive low-spreading ornamental flower to common (sometimes detested) weed of lawns, fields and abandoned areas. Each plant features a sprawling, flattened rosette of small, spatula-shaped, dark green leaves to 1-2” tall. Daisies (to 2” diameter) with white rays and yellow centers bloom on pubescent stems rising to 3-6” tall. Young leaves may be eaten raw in salads or cooked. In the St. Louis area, plants are not considered to be lawn weeds, with best bloom occurring in spring when the mornings are cool. Plants typically burn out with summer heat. Native to Europe, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the northern U. S. and West Coast.Genus name comes from the Latin word bellus meaning pretty.Specific epithet means lasting through the year.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In cool summer areas, plants can spread and difficult to eradicate once established.
","
Garden Uses
In cool summer locations, English daisy has a number of different uses including beds, border fronts, rock gardens and wild flower areas where it may be naturalized without concern of spread. Also effective as a ground cover, edger or companion to spring bulbs. Excellent in containers.

Culture
In St. Louis, paper birch is best grown in medium to wet, well-drained sandy or rocky loams in part shade. It is best sited in a northern or eastern exposure that receives some afternoon shade. It needs consistently moist soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. It needs little pruning, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running. Performs best in cool northern climates where summer temperatures rarely exceed 75 degrees F. and where root zones are generally covered with snow throughout the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula papyrifera, commonly called paper birch or canoe birch, is primarily native to the cold climates of Canada and Alaska (USDA Zones 1-3), with its range dipping down into a few of the northern U.S. states (USDA Zones 4-5A) and further south in the mountains (to Colorado in the Rockies and to North Carolina in the Appalachians). This tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips to reveal an orange-brown inner bark. Mature trees develop black markings on the white bark. Single trunk trees grow to 50-70’ tall with an oval rounded crown. Multi-trunked trees grow shorter with a more irregular crown. Ovate, irregularly toothed, dark green leaves (to 4” long). Quality clear yellow fall color. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in drooping catkins (to 4” long) and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1 1/4” long). Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer. The use of the bark for making birch bark canoes is well known.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means paper-bearing.
","
Problems
This species of birch grows poorly and is generally short-lived in the St. Louis climate. It thrives in cool northern summers, but does poorly in the heat and humidity of St. Louis summers. Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which, in the St. Louis area, typically infects and kills trees that are stressed by summer heat and humidity. Although paper birches have some susceptibility to aphids, leaf miner, birch skeletonizer and dieback, these problems are somewhat minor in comparison to the borer.
","
Garden Uses
In cool northern climates, paper birch is an excellent landscape tree that mixes well with evergreens and produces good fall color. It is not recommended for the St. Louis climate. River birch (see Betula nigra) is a better selection for St. Louis.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Blechnum spicant, called deer fern or hard fern, is a northern species with a somewhat circumpolar distribution but most ferns in the genus Blechnum are found in tropical areas. It is native to northwestern North American from Alaska to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, a small corner of northern Idaho and California. It primarily occurs in moist to wet coniferous forests, wet slide areas, stream banks or bogs in up to sub-alpine terrain. It is also native to Europe and northeast Asia. This fern is particularly distinctive because of its two different types of fronds. Evergreen sterile fronds (to 8-24” long) are stiff, leathery, pinnatifid and dark green, forming a loose outward-spreading, flattened rosette. As the season progresses, sterile fronds may lie horizontally on the ground. Fertile fronds (16-24” long) are located in an erect vertical fountain in the center of the sterile frond rosette. They are similar to the sterile ones but taller, with much thinner and widely separated leaflets. Fertile fronds turn brown and wither by the end of the summer, leaving the evergreen sterile rosette.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name blechnon for a fern (probably not this one though).

Be careful when pruning to avoid injury from the 1 to 2 inch long thorns. In St. Louis, to bring bougainvillea into flower, a dormant period at a low temperature is essential in winter. The plant will drop most of its leaves and you should stop fertilizing. From March on, it must be given a well-lit, warm position. Late in May, it is best placed outdoors. If pruning is required this should be done immediately after flowering. Pinching the tips of new growth will encourage branching. Water freely in summer and sparingly in the winter. Fertilize every two weeks during the growing season.

Noteworthy Characteristics
The 14 species of this South American genus in the four-o-clock family, seen in warm-temperate to tropical regions as spectacular climbers, are really scrambling shrubs and usually remain fairly compact or behave as ground covers if left free standing. Leaves are thin, sometimes downy, and broadly elliptical with pointed tips; stems are protected by long narrow thorns, found at the leaf axils. Foliage is evergreen or deciduous, depending on the species and climate. True flowers, in groups of 1 to 3 are tubular, creamy white to yellow and around 1 inch wide, largely hidden by brightly colored petal-like bracts. In the St. Louis area, these plants are a shrubby vine that can be grown in greenhouses, sun porches or in containers or baskets outdoors in the summer months.Genus name honors Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1729-1811), sailor and explorer, who sailed round the world 1767-1769.
","
Problems
Mealybug and scale can be a problem indoors and aphids can be troublesome outdoors. Keep plants out of high traffic areas to avoid injury from the thorns. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helichrysum heldreichii, commonly known as strawflower or everlasting, is a tender perennial or subshrub that typically grows in a mound to 2-3’ tall and as wide on woody-based stems clad with alternate, simple, linear leaves (to 3” long) covered with silvery-white downy hairs.  It is native to chalky-limestone cliffs in Crete where it is currently classified as “Vulnerable” as per the 1995 Red Data Book of Rare and Threatened Plants of Greece.  Inflorescence is a compound terminal corymb (flowers in clusters) of numerous, small, yellow-orange disk florets (rays absent) subtended by pale yellow involucre bracts.  Flowers bloom in May.  Flowers are popular additions to dried arrangements because the yellow florets and bracts retain their yellow color after being cut and dried, hence the common name of everlasting.  Fruits are seed-like achenes.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning the sun and chrysos meaning golden.Specific epithet honors Theodor H.H. von Heldreich (1822-1902), German botanist who settled in Greece where he reportedly discovered 7 new genera and over 700 new species of plants.

Grow plants in the garden from seed. Seed may be started indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Plants will remain in the garden from year to year by self-seeding. Plants have escaped gardens in many parts of the U.S. and may be considered invasive in some areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia marginata, commonly called snow-on-the-mountain, is a warm-weather annual that is native to prairies from Minnesota and the Dakotas to Colorado and Texas. In Missouri, it is native to the loess mounds in the far northwestern corner of the State (Steyermark). This is a single-stemmed plant that typically grows to 1-3' tall. It is usually unbranched below the inflorescence. Leaves (1-3"" long) are medium green in spring, with the upper leaves gradually developing showy clean white margins. Compound cymes of inconspicuous greenish-yellow true flowers bloom at the stem ends from mid-summer to early fall. Although the true flowers (borne in cyathia) lack sepals or petals and are not showy, these flowers are subtended by long-lasting, petal-like white bracts (modified leaves) that are showy. Flower bracts and variegated upper leaves provide the ornamental show. Plant sap is a milky juice that is toxic if ingested.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet is in reference to the white leaf margins.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where it is easily grown in evenly moist but well-drained loams (e.g., sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade.  Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun.  When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to bronze in winter.  Limited cold tolerance.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Should be grown in a protected location sheltered from strong winds in the northern parts of Zone 7 where it is marginally winter hardy.  Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing.  True species may be winter hardy to Zone 8, but B. harlandii of gardens (form of B. microphylla - see below) may have slightly better winter hardiness.  

Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.  Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing.  Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date.  Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost.  Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots.  Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2” thick).  Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation.  Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus harlandii, commonly known as Harland boxwood, is a small, bushy, multi-stemmed broadleaf evergreen shrub with a rounded vase-shaped form.  It typically grows to 2-3’ (infrequently to 5’) tall and as wide.  It is native to southern China where it is often found growing in open wooded areas and stream margins.  Bright green leaves are oblanceolate to obovate-oblong (to 1.25” long).  Each leaf has an indentation at the leaf tip.  Fragrant pale yellow flowers bloom in April–May.  Staminate flowers are stalked but pistilate ones are sessile. Attractive white trunk accents.

Many plants sold in North America under this species name are in reality forms of Buxus microphylla.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood of some plants in he genus to make boxes.  Another theory on common name is that the name is in reference to young plant stems which are quadrangular (square box cross section).
","
Problems
Harland boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning.  No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot.  Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils.  The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid.  In the deep South, nematodes are of concern.  New growth is particularly susceptible to winter damage.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caesalpinia pulcherrima, commonly called peacock flower or Barbados Pride, is a fast-growing upright shrub or small tree which typically matures to 10' tall (in shrub form) or to as much as 20' tall (in tree form).  It is native to tropical America (probably the West Indies), but is now widely grown in tropical areas around the world for its long bloom of colorful flowers in upright racemes on prickly branches clad with twice pinnate green leaves.  Bowl-shaped 5-petaled flowers (to 2"" wide) bloom spring to fall (year-round in tropical climates) in 4-8"" long terminal racemes (to 40 flowers per raceme) located at the branch ends.  Flowers feature bright orange-yellow petals with contrasting elongated dark red stamens.  Another common name for this shrub is dwarf poinciana in recognition of the similarity (although of smaller size) of the flowers of this shrub to the flowers of royal poinciana (Delonix regia).  Feathery, twice pinnate green leaves are usually evergreen, but sometimes deciduous in areas near the edge of its growing range.  Each leaf has 5-8 pairs of pinnae and 6-10 pairs of leaflets per pinna.  Flowers are followed by oblong, flat fruits (seed pods to 2.5-4"" long), with each pod containing 8-10 dark brown to black seeds which are ejected as the pod splits open at maturity.  This shrub has sharp prickles along its stems, leading to the sometimes used common name of Barbados flower fence because of its use in the West Indies as a flowering barrier fence.  Green seed pods are cooked and eaten in Mexico.Genus name honors Andrea Cesalpini (1524/25-1603), Italian botanist, philosopher, and physician to Pope Clement VIII.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pulcher meaning beauty.

Cultivars expand the available flower colors to include many pastel shades and some bicolors. Single to double flowerheads (3-4” diameter) may have contrasting darker center disks. The species is an Old World potherb and garden plant that was quite popular in England at the time of Shakespeare. It typically grows 1-2’ tall and as wide. Although the flowers and leaves are somewhat bitter tasting, they are edible and may be added fresh or dried to soups, salads or rice dishes for both color and flavor. Aromatic, lance-shaped to oblong-obovate green leaves (to 6” long).Genus name comes from the Latin word calendae meaning the first day of the month.Specific epithet means sold in shops. Frequently applied to plants believed to have medicinal properties.

Though native to rich woodland areas in Alabama, Georgia and northern Florida, it is winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus parviflora. commonly called bottlebrush buckeye, is noted for being one of the best summer-flowering shrubs for shade areas. It is a dense, mounded, suckering, deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub which typically grows 6-12' tall. Features palmate green leaves (5-7 leaflets) and erect, showy, cylindrical panicles (to 12"" long) of tubular white flowers with conspicuous red anthers and pinkish filaments. Mid-summer bloom can be spectacular. Flowers give way to glossy inedible, pear-shaped nuts (buckeyes) encased in husks, however these nuts are infrequently produced in cultivation in the northern parts of this shrub's growing range (including St. Louis). Foliage turns yellow in autumn. A very large planting of bottlebrush buckeye can be observed on both sides of the sidewalk leading south from the Climatron at the Missouri Botanical Garden.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means small flowers.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun, but appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Tolerates a wide range of soils. Performs well in sandy soils. Add sand to clay soils as needed to improve drainage. Bulbs are best planted in fall.'Globemaster' is a sterile hybrid that does not produce seed, so self-seeding is obviously not a concern. Plant new bulbs 4-6"" deep (3 times bulb diameter) and 12"" apart in fall. Bulbs of established plants may be dug, divided and replanted in late summer to early fall after foliage has died down.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
The genus Allium contains over 700 species of bulbous or rhizomatous plants. All possess oniony smelling flowers and foliage. Some species are grown for culinary purposes and others for ornamental purposes. Plants typically produce showy flower umbels on naked scapes rising above a clump of linear grass-like leaves. Ornamental alliums generally range in height from 3” to 4-6’ tall.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.'Globemaster' is a hybrid cross between A. christophii and A. macleanii. It is a bulbous perennial that is ornamentally grown for its spring bloom of spherical, deep lavender flower heads. Strap-shaped, gray-green, basal leaves form a clump of foliage in spring. As the leaves begin to wither in mid-spring, stout flowering stems rise to 20-30"" tall topped with huge, globular, deep lavender to silver-purple flower heads (terminal umbels to 6-10"" in diameter) packed with individual star-shaped florets which collectively display a metallic sheen. Flowers appear in an impressive, long-lasting, spring bloom (May in St. Louis) in which new florets continue to develop as the original ones fade. Flower heads dry after bloom and remain ornamental in the garden well into summer. Flowers generally lack fragrance.
","
Problems
Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils. Watch for mildew, rust and leaf spots. Thrips are an occasional problem. Deer and rabbits tend to avoid this plant.Plants may colonize over time, but are not considered to be invasive.

Culture
Grow in moist, acidic, humusy, somewhat lean, sandy or gravelly, very well-drained soils of average fertility in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in full sun (better flowering), but may appreciate some part afternoon light shade in hot summer climates. Scotch heather prefers a moist and cool climate. It generally dislikes the high heat/humidity of the Midwest and deep South and is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 6. It also dislikes the heavy clay soils commonly found in the St. Louis area. Plants need regular and consistent moisture and should not be allowed to dry out. Do not site plants in locations exposed to strong winds. Mulch with peat moss. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow root systems. Prune in spring before new growth appears. Older shrubs often become leggy and unkempt, and appreciate an annual spring pruning.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calluna vulgaris, commonly called Scotch heather, heather or ling, is a small, variably-sized, evergreen shrub that is native primarily to moors, dunes, bogs, heaths and hillsides from northern and western Europe to Siberia, Turkey and Morocco. It has naturalized in parts of North America, particularly in the northeastern U.S. and the Northwest. In optimum growing conditions, it will typically form thick mats of foliage. Tiny, four-ranked, scale-like leaves in overlapping pairs appear on slender stems rising on average to 24” tall. However cultivars appear in a wider range of sizes including prostrate forms with small tufts to only 4” tall. Leaves are typically gray to green in spring and summer but acquire bronze to purple tones in fall and winter. Rose pink to purplish pink flowers in terminal, one-sided, spike-like racemes appear in mid to late summer. The Royal Horticultural Society currently lists over 800 cultivars of this species.Genus name comes from the Greek word kalluno meaning to cleanse or adorn. Plants were used for making brooms.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
Watch for spider mites and oystershell scale. Stem and root rot may occur, particularly during warm and humid summer weather.
","
Garden Uses
Smaller varieties are useful as ground covers or in the rock garden. More erect shrubs are effective when planted in mass on hillsides. Also may be sited in borders and as background plants. Scotch heather generally combines well with dwarf conifers and deciduous shrubs.

Best grown in deep, moderately fertile, moist but well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Appreciates a location protected from drying winter winds. Tolerates shearing. Although native to western North America, this incense cedar does very well in the East and is surprisingly tolerant of summer heat and humidity.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calocedrus decurrens, commonly called incense cedar, is an aromatic evergreen conifer with upright branching that is narrow-columnar in youth but may broaden with age to conical sometimes with a rounded crown. It is native to the Cascades, Sierras and coastal ranges, usually scattered in mixed conifer forest on western slopes, from Oregon to California, southwestern Nevada and northern Baja California. In the wild, it may grow to 100-150’ and live to 1000+ years. In cultivation, it typically grows shorter to 30-50’ tall. Flattened branchlets in fern-like sprays are covered with overlapping, lustrous, rich green, scale-like foliage in whorls of four. Foliage has an incense-like aroma when crushed. Reddish-brown, deeply-furrowed, scaly bark appears on mature trees. Solitary fruiting cones (to 1” long) ripen in summer at the branchlet ends. Although small, cones are very distinctive and are commonly described as resembling duckbills when they open to release their seed. Synonymous with and formerly known as Libocedrus decurrens.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalos meaning beautiful and cedrus meaning cedar tree.

Grow in full sun to part shade in shallow water at the margins of a pond or water garden or in wet, boggy soils. Best flowering usually occurs in full sun, but plants appreciate some part shade in the heat of the summer. If sited in full sun in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area, plants may go dormant in summer. May be grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caltha palustris, commonly called marsh marigold, is a rhizomatous perennial that in North America is native to marshes, swamps, wet meadows and stream margins from Newfoundland to Alaska south to Nebraska, Tennessee and North Carolina. Unfortunately, the name marsh marigold is only descriptively accurate as to this plant’s habitat, because it neither looks like nor is related to marigolds (Aster family). It belongs to the buttercup family, and its shiny yellow flowers indeed look very much like buttercups. It typically grows 12-18” tall on hollow, branching stems. Bright yellow flowers (1-2” diameter) with 5-9 waxy deep yellow petal-like sepals bloom in spring (April to June). Flowers give way to seed pods which split open when ripe to disperse the seeds within. Long-stalked, rounded to cordate, glossy green basal leaves (to 7” across) attain mature size in summer well after flowering. Upper stem leaves are smaller and stalkless. Flower buds may be cooked and pickled in vinegar for use as a substitute for capers. Young leaves are also edible as cooked greens when boiled. No part of this plant should ever be eaten raw however.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a plant with a yellow flower, probably Calendula.Specific epithet means marsh-loving.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where this evergreen shrub is typically grown in organically rich, acidic, well-drained soils with consistent moisture in part shade locations. Established plants do well with moderate but even moisture. Plants appreciate protection from early morning sun and from direct hot afternoon sun. They often thrive in sun-dappled part shade conditions under the protection of tree canopies. Protection from strong winds is also important. Apply a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark). Prune after flowering to thin branching and to control size and shape. Most camellias are purchased in pots. When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to not plant them too deep (soil level in the ground should be the same as the soil level in the pot). Plants may be effectively grown in tubs or other large containers. This camellia is not winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a). It may be grown in containers that are overwintered in a cool greenhouse where necessary growing conditions (including bright light and cool winter temperatures of 45-60 degrees F) can be met.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camellia crapnelliana was discovered by W. J. Tutcher in 1903 growing as a single tree on Mount Parker in Hong Kong. It is now ornamentally grown for its attractive dark green foliage, late autumn flowers and rusty brown bark. It typically grows as a small tree to as much as 20-30' tall. Leathery, elliptic to oblong-elliptic, green leaves (to 5"" long) with serrulate margins are evergreen. White flowers (to 2-4"" across) with 6-8 petals and bushy yellow stamens in the center bloom singly in fall to early winter. Flowers have a musky aroma. This species is difficult to propagate from cuttings and is generally grown from seed.Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.
","
Problems
Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, anthracnose, viruses, black mold, petal blight, canker and root rot. If petal blight occurs (browning that runs from edges to the center), all infected plant parts should be promptly removed. Yellow leaves with green veins may indicate chlorosis which can be treated by adding iron/iron chelates to the soil. Scale can be a troublesome insect pest. Watch for aphids, planthoppers and spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this camellia is an excellent small flowering evergreen tree or large shrub that provides exciting winter bloom for woodland gardens, shrub borders, backgrounds, lawns and around homes.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex muskingumensis, commonly called palm sedge, is a dense, clump-forming sedge which is grown for its foliage effect. Produces rigid, erect stems to 20"" tall with 8"" long, pointed, grass-like, light green leaves radiating from the stem tops. Commonly called palm sedge since the leaves somewhat superficially resemble miniature palm fronds. A Missouri native which is found most often in wooded swamps and on wooded flood plains of rivers. Spread by rhizomes and self-seeding. Insignificant flowers appear in May on terminal spikes which are not showy but are noticeable and of some interest and persist throughout the summer. Foliage promptly turns yellow after frost.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Species is named for the Muskingum River in Ohio.

Soils should never be allowed to dry out and need consistent supplemental watering in hot summer weather.  Cut foliage close to the ground and remove as needed in late winter.  Plants may be propagated by division or seed.  In optimum growing conditions, plants will naturalize by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex radiata, commonly known as eastern star sedge (star-like flower clusters) or straight-styled wood sedge (tip of the female flower known as the style is straight rather than curled), is an evergreen perennial that typically produces a dense foliage clump to 8-12” tall of narrow, grass-like, medium green blades.  This sedge is native to mesic to wet-mesic bottomlands and upland forests and on moist ravine slopes, sometimes in seasonally wet locations, in eastern North America from Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Georgia.  

Ascending to wide-spreading, triangular culms (flower stems) rise above the foliage clump in spring to 20-28” tall.  Most culms are topped by an open, elongate, yellowish-green, terminal inflorescence (to 1-3” long) consisting of 3-8 flower spikelets.  Each spikelet contains a star-like cluster of 3-9 perigynia (perigynum is a scale-like bract which encloses each female flower).  Flowers bloom from April-May.  Male flowers, if present, are borne above the female flowers on the spikes (androgynous).   Female flowers are followed by tiny, ovate to obovate achenes which radiate outward from the stem in a star-like pattern.  Short rhizomes are poorly-developed. 
 
Carex radiata is very similar to and was formerly included in C. rosea.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet from Latin means radiating in reference to the developing seeds radiating outward from the stem.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex stricta is a rhizomatous evergreen sedge that grows in dense tussocks (clumps) to 1-3' tall and to 2' wide. It is an emergent aquatic that is native primarily to wet swales, marshes, bogs, wet meadows and creek margins in eastern North America (Quebec to Ontario to North Dakota south to Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina). In Missouri, it is limited to several locations in calcareous, spring fed, swampy meadows in the Ozarks in the southeastern part of the State (Steyermark). Narrow, glaucous, grass-like leaves (to 3/8"" wide) grow in dense clumps. Older leaves turn straw brown as they die, and build up around the base of each clump surrounding the newer yellowish-green leaves. Flora of North America reports that plants grown in sites with seasonal flooding form distinctive large clumps, and plants grown in drier areas tend to spread more by rhizomes. Flowers appear in late spring in reddish-brown spikes atop stems rising above the foliage. Steyermark maintains that the scattered Missouri populations of this species are all that remains from an ancient Pleistocene presence that has gradually disappeared over time as the glaciers disappeared and the weather warmed.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means erect or upright.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Garden Uses
Best grown in mass for foliage effect in moist to wet areas including ones with standing water. Flowers are not showy. Good selection for low spots, stream/pond margins or areas with seasonal flooding. Also may be grown in a variety of upland locations as long as soils are kept consistently moist.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. This plant is intolerant of frost. It is best grown in tropical or semi-tropical climates in rich, humusy, consistently moist but well-drained organic loams in full sun. Best fruit develops in full sun. Plants tolerate light shade if grown ornamentally instead of for fruit. In St. Louis, plants may be grown in large tubs that should be overwintered indoors in bright locations. Container plants may need to be replaced every 4-5 years. Papayas can be heavy feeders, so regular fertilization is necessary.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carica papaya, commonly called papaya, is a small, frost-tender, succulent, broadleaf evergreen tree that bears papaya fruits throughout the year. Each tree (Hortus Third asserts papaya is technically a giant herb because it never produces true woody tissue) typically has a single, unbranched, non-woody trunk bearing the scars of old leaf bases. The trunk is topped by an umbrella-like canopy of palmately lobed leaves. Large, fleshy, melon-like fruits (papayas) hang in clusters attached to the trunk top just under the leaf canopy. Papaya typically grows to 6-20' tall (container plants to 10' tall) and is most noted for its edible melon-like fruit. It is native to lowland tropical areas of Central and South America, but is now grown in tropical to subtropical regions throughout the world both commercially and in home gardens. In the U.S., it is commercially grown in southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii. Seven lobed leaves (to 2' wide) on leaf stalks to 2-3' long are ornamentally attractive. Species plants are typically dioecious (separate male and female trees), but cultivars are hermaphroditic. Fragrant, trumpet-shaped, yellowish-white flowers bloom throughout the year, with males in long racemes and females in small clusters or solitary. Female flowers give way to smooth-skinned green fruits that ripen to yellow-orange with a yellow to pinkish-orange flesh and central cavity of pea-sized black seeds. Fruits and seeds are edible. Commercially sold fruits are typically 6-8"" long and weigh about one pound, but fruits in the wild in ideal growing conditions can grow much larger with a wieght of up to 20 pounds. Papain (an enzyme extracted from the milky sap of green fruit) is popularly used as a meat tenderizer, chewing gum additive and beer clarifier plus for a large number of additional medical, cosmetic and industrial purposes.Genus name comes from Greek meaning a kind of fig in reference to the fig-shaped leaves.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cassia fistula, commonly called golden shower tree, is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to 30-40' tall in an upright form often open at the top.  It is native to India, Malaysia and Southeast Asia.  It is well-known for producing a show-stopping bloom of yellow flowers in May-June/July.  Even pinnate compound leaves to 12-16"" long with 4-8 pairs of ovate-lanceolate leaflets (each leaflet to 4"" long) per leaf.  Leaves usually drop in April as a prelude to flowering which occurs from May to early July.  Five-petaled, bright yellow flowers bloom in 8-18"" pendulous terminal racemes which cover the tree with profuse bloom.  Flowers are lightly scented.  Leaves return as the flowering progresses, with foliage totally restored by July.  Tree is often considered to be semi-deciduous or semi-evergreen because of this brief loss of leaves.  A second less significant bloom often occurs in September but without loss of leaves.  Flowers are followed by slender, terete, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long.  Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year.  Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.  Golden shower tree is the National tree of Thailand and the national flower of Thailand.  Popular plant as ornamental and for herbal medicine.  Dried fruit has medicinal properties.  Is now widely grown in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet means hollow like a pipe.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some tolerance for brief light frost with temperatures to 25 degrees F.  Mildew and leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental.  Shade tree.  Formerly planted in some populated areas as a street tree, but this use has waned as planners have shifted to using Cassia x nealiae for this purpose because this hybrid does not drop as many leaves at flowering time and does not produce any seed pods.

Culture
Grow in moist, well-drained loams in full sun. Species plants should not be planted as ornamentals due to susceptibility to blight. Research is ongoing for developing disease resistant varieties.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Castanea dentata, commonly called American chesnut, was once a major component of the Eastern hardwood forest. It is almost extinct in the wild now, having succumbed to chestnut blight, a bark fungal disease that probably entered the U.S. in a shipment of nursery stock from Japan in the late 1890s. American chestnut now persists mostly in the form of sprouts from old stumps and root systems. Typically the sprouts grow up and possibly flower and fruit for several years before dying back from the blight. Before blight introduction, mature trees typically reached 50-75’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with globular spreading crowns. Oblong-lanceolate, toothed, dull green leaves (6-10” long) turn shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic creamy yellow-white male flowers are densely clustered in slender catkins (4-8” long). Female flowers appear in smaller inconspicuous catkins. Blooms in June. Small nuts (hazel nut size) are sweet and edible, and are encased in spiny burrs (2-3” diameter). H. W. Longfellow’s poem “The Village Blacksmith” begins with the line “Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands….” in reference to this once stately and popular American tree.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet means toothed in reference to the toothed leaves.
","
Problems
Chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica formerly Endothia parasitica). Also susceptible to leaf spots, anthracnose and powdery mildew.
","

Culture
Grow in moist, well-drained, loams in full sun. Tolerant of summer heat and humidity. Established trees do well in dry conditions. If growing this tree at least in part for its edible nuts, planting more than one tree facilitates cross-pollination and generally produces a more abundant nut crop.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Castanea mollissima, commonly called Chinese chestnut, is native to China and possibly Korea. It is a medium sized, low-branched, deciduous tree that typically grows 40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with an open rounded crown. It is grown as an ornamental tree and/or for its edible nuts. It is noted for its resistance to chestnut blight which has nearly wiped out the native American chestnut (Castanea dentata). Chinese chestnut features oblong-lanceolate, coarsely toothed, dark green leaves (5-8” long) that are soft green and pubescent beneath. Leaves turn varying shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic monoecious creamy yellowish-white flowers appear in catkins in late spring (June in St. Louis), the male flowers located at the top portion of the catkin and the female flowers located near the base. Flowers can be quite showy, albeit for a brief period. Flowers are followed by edible chestnuts which are encased in spiny dehiscent burs (2-3” diameter), usually 2-3 nuts per bur. Although Chinese chestnuts are sometime sold in farmers’ markets, it is the Spanish chestnut, Castanea sativa, that produces the chestnuts most often sold commercially.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word for soft, in reference to the pubescent twigs and leaf undersides.
","
Problems
Chinese chestnut is resistant, but not immune, to chestnut blight (Endothia parasitica) which is a fatal fungal bark disease. Also susceptible to leaf spot, anthracnose and twig and stem cankers. Weevils can be a problem in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful specimen shade tree for lawns. Unfortunately, as is the case with the fruit of the sweet gum but perhaps more so, falling chestnuts can pose a significant litter problem, and often make walking barefoot in the lawn a real adventure. On the positive side, the chestnuts may be harvested for roasting on an open fire as it were.

In the St. Louis area, this plant may not survive harsh winters even if grown in a protected location, and may be best utilized as an annual for pots, baskets and containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Vinca major, commonly called greater periwinkle, large periwinkle or blue buttons, is an evergreen, prostrate, mat-forming perennial with long trailing stems. It is widely used as a ground cover and container plant. North of USDA Zone 7, it is more commonly used as a container plant. Dark green leaves (to 3” long) are ovate to lanceolate. Solitary, tubular, phlox-like, pale violet-blue flowers (to 1 1/2” across) bloom on upright stalks from the leaf axils in spring, and usually continue to bloom intermittently throughout the summer into autumn. Foliage of this periwinkle typically grows to 12-18"" tall and spreads indefinitely. Once established, this plant will spread aggressively, rooting at the nodes where the stems come in contact with the soil.Genus name is from Latin meaning to bind or wind around in reference to the long, flexible stems that were used in wreath making.Specific epithet means bigger or larger.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Potential insect pests include aphids and nematodes. Potential disease problems include root rot, leaf spot and blight. In southern climates where winter hardiness is not a problem, plants can spread somewhat aggressively into adjacent lawns or garden areas.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, greater periwinkle is a versatile ground cover for shady areas. Good cover for bulbs. Effective on slopes or banks to stabilize soils and prevent erosion. Trailing stems may be cascaded over stone walls. Dense foliage discourages weeds. Excellent selection for hanging baskets, window boxes and containers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cedrus deodara, know as Deodar cedar, is an evergreen conifers that is pyramidal when young, maturing to flat-topped trees with broad-spreading horizontal branching. Deodar cedar is perhaps the most pendulous of the true cedars, with drooping branchlets and branching that is gracefully drooping at the tips. Lower branches typically remain on the tree as it ages, often touching the ground. This is a medium-growing tree that typically matures to 40-50’ tall in its first 25 years. In its native habitat, trees reportedly will grow much taller over time, sometimes reaching 150-200’ tall. Dark grayish-green needles (to 1.25” long) appear in clusters. Upright cones (to 4” long). It is native to the Himalayas.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet comes from the North Indian name of this plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Tip blight and root rot may occur. Winter hardiness is a concern in the St. Louis area where consideration should be given to planting a cultivar such as ‘Shalimar’ that has slightly better hardiness than the species. Notwithstanding the winter hardiness problems, these plants usually struggle in the St. Louis area where environmental conditions do not favor most conifers.

Culture
Easily grown in most soils. Best in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun. Lean soils help restrain growth. Will grow in part shade, but needs full sun for best flowering and subsequent fruit display. Prune in late winter to early spring. Mature vines require little pruning other than removal of dead or excess growth. These plants are primarily dioecious (separate male and female plants), although some have a few perfect flowers. Female plants need a male pollinator to produce the attractive fruit that is the signature of this vine. Unfortunately, some nurseries do not sell the vines as male or female (as is commonly done with hollies). Generally one male plant is needed for 6-9 female plants. Female plants may be vegetatively propagated to create more female plants. Vines may be grown on structures or allowed to ramble along the ground. It is generally best to avoid growing vines up small trees or through shrubs because vines grow rapidly and can girdle trunks and branches causing damage and sometimes death. Vines sucker at the roots to form large colonies in the wild. Vines will also self-seed, often with assistance from local bird populations.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Celastrus scandens, commonly called American bittersweet, is a deciduous twining woody vine that is best known for its showy red berries that brighten up fall and winter landscapes. This species is native to central and eastern North America including Missouri. In Missouri, bittersweet is typically found in woodland areas, thickets, rocky slopes, bluffs, glade peripheries and along fence rows throughout the State (Steyermark). It is often seen growing along the ground, over and through low shrubs or circling trees in the wild. Berry-laden branches are prized for use as indoor decorations, and collection of the branches in the wild has significantly reduced the wild populations in some areas. Rapidly grows to 20’. It produces serrate, elliptic to ovate, yellowish-green leaves (to 4” long). Staminate and pistillate flowers appear in clusters on separate plants in late spring. Flowers are greenish-white to yellow. Fertilized female flowers give way in summer to spherical orange-yellow fruits. Fruits split open in fall to reveal scarlet fleshy berry-like seeds (arils). Fruits are poisonous if ingested, but are considered to be quite tasty by many birds. In the 1700s, plants were given the name bittersweet by European colonists because their fruits purportedly resembled in appearance the fruits of a Eurasian nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) that was known to them as bittersweet. The common name of false bittersweet also came to be used for the within species to distinguish it from the Eurasian nightshade. American bittersweet is the generally accepted common name that is used today, in large part to distinguish this American native from its aggressive Asiatic relative, C. orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) which has escaped cultivation and is naturalizing in parts of eastern and central North America.Genus name comes from the Greek word kelastros for an evergreen tree.Specific epithet means climbing.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Euonymus scale and two-marked treehoppers may cause significant damage in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Woodland gardens, naturalized areas. Provides quick cover for fences, arbors, trellises, posts, walls or other structures in the landscape. Also may be grown along the ground to camouflage rock piles or old tree stumps.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celtis laevigata, commonly called sugarberry, sugar hackberry or southern hackberry, is basically a southern version of common or northern hackberry (see C. occidentalis). Sugarberry differs from common hackberry inter alia by (1) fruits are juicier and sweeter, (2) bark is less corky, (3) leaves are narrower with mostly smooth margins, (4) better resistance to witches’ broom and (5) less winter hardiness. Sugarberry is a medium to large sized deciduous tree that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with upright-arching branching and a rounded spreading crown. Trunk diameter ranges from 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’). This tree is native to and widely distributed throughout the southeast and south central U.S. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams and floodplains mostly south of the Missouri River except for the Ozark region. (Steyermark). Mature gray bark develops a warty texture. Insignificant, mostly monoecious, greenish flowers appear in spring (April –May), with male flowers in clusters and female flowers solitary. Female flowers give way to an often abundant fruit crop of round fleshy berry-like drupes maturing to deep purple. Each drupe has one round brown seed within. Fruits are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Birds consume the fruits and disperse the seeds. Fleshy parts of the fruit are edible and sweet. Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, rough-textured, untoothed, glossy to dull green leaves (2-4” long) have mostly uneven leaf bases. Undistinguished yellow fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another tree.Specific epithet means smooth.
","
Problems
Hackberry nipple gall is so common in the St. Louis area that it is often used as an aid in identifying hackberries. Although the galls do not hurt these trees, they often significantly disfigure the leaves. Sugarberry has good resistance to witches’ broom (dwarfed, dense, contorted twig clusters at the branch ends). Powdery mildew and leaf spot may occur. Watch for lacebugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
This is a tough shade tree that grows in a wide range of soils. This tree may be used as a lawn tree or street tree. Seeds can pose clean up problems if trees are sited near sidewalks or patios, however.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Centranthus ruber, commonly called red valerian or Jupiter’s beard, is a well-branched, bushy, clump-forming, woody-based perennial which is valued for its ability to produce, often in poor soils, a showy bloom of star-shaped crimson, pink or white flowers from spring to frost.  Although native to the Mediterranean, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the United States, particularly along the west coast.  Flowers (each to 1/2"") appear in dense terminal clusters (cymes) atop upright to relaxed stems rising above the foliage to 1.5-3' tall.  Flowers are fragrant.  If not deadheaded, flowers give way to dandelion-like seed heads which are typically disbursed around the landscape by wind.  Fleshy, sessile, oval to lanceolate leaves (to 4"" long) are gray-green.Genus name comes from the Greek words kentron meaning a spur and anthos meaning a flower for the spurred flower.Specific epithet means red in reference to flower color of species plants.

Culture
Best grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a somewhat wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones which inevitably lead to root rot.  Grows well in cool summer climates.  Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 2.  Intolerant of the high summer heat and humidity of the deep South.  Spreads by runners to fill in areas, but is not considered to be invasive in the hot St. Louis climate where it is less robust than in cooler northern climates.  Plants will self-seed in the garden if spent blooms are not removed.  Best to shear off flower stems after bloom in order to prevent self-seeding, reduce future foliage decline,  and shape/neaten the foliage mat.  Large beds can be mowed on a high setting.  Divide every year if needed to help maintain compact size of the mat.  Starter plants may be planted 9-12” apart to quickly cover large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cerastium tomentosum, known as snow-in-summer, is a short-lived, low-growing, mat-forming perennial which is typically massed in sunny locations as a ground cover.  Tufts of narrow, gray-green leaves (each to 1"" long and 1/4"" wide) form a 6” tall foliage mat.  Leaves are evergreen.  In late spring, flower stems rise above the foliage mat (typically to 8-12”) carrying clusters (cymes) of white blooms which form a snow-like carpet (hence the common name).  Flowers (to 1” diameter) have 5 notched petals and are similar in appearance and closely related to several of the chickweeds.  Less invasive, more compact cultivars of this species usually make better garden plants.Genus name comes from the Greek word keras meaning horn in reference to the seed capsule which in some species is bent slightly like a cow’s horn.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's woolly white leaves and stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Damping off may occur in climates with high humidity or locations with too much shade.  Root rot can be a serious problem if plants are grown in poorly-drained soils or in soils that remain wet.  Plants are short-lived, and dead patches often begin to appear after several years.  In St. Louis, foliage usually declines as the summer progresses.
","
Garden Uses
Ground cover for sunny areas.  Rock gardens, border fronts, cottage gardens, edgings, bulb cover or dry stone wall planting pockets.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in sandy loams.  May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range.  New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist.  Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Avoid hot and dry sites.  Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge.  Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter.  Spring or summer pruning often  results in significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching.  Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes.  Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April).  The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance.  Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs.  Samaras ripen in September-October.  Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze.  Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.‘Katsura' is a dense, compact, cultivar that is most noted for its beautiful spring foliage. Small, palmate, 5-lobed leaves (to 1"" long) emerge chartreuse with orange-tinted margins in spring, mature to bright green by summer and finally turn pastel shades of orange and yellow in fall. Leaf lobes are lanceolate with slender tips and shallow-toothed margins. 'Katsura' typically grows in a vase-shaped form to 4-6' tall over the first 10 years, but gradually becomes more rounded with age as it matures to 10-12' tall. Small reddish flowers in spring are somewhat attractive on close inspection, but are not showy from a distance.
","
Problems
Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots.  Potential insect pests include  aphids, scale, borers, bagworms, and root weevils.  Mites may be troublesome.  Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late spring frosts.  Chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8b-11.  Better winter hardiness than most other palms (tolerates brief temperature dips to 15-20 degrees F. in winter).  Easily grown in rich, moist, well-drained soils.  Best growth occurs in Mediterranean-type climates.  Prefers a bright sunny location, but tolerates part shade.  Loses compact shape in too much shade.  Best with consistent moisture, but has some drought tolerance once established.  Avoid overly moist soils.  This palm is often propagated by seed.  Dividing clumps or removing suckers can be difficult.  Specimens purchased in pots from nurseries are often reasonably priced.  In colder areas where plants are not winter hardy, they may be grown in containers which can be brought indoors and overwintered in cool, bright sunny locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaerops humilis, commonly known as Mediterranean fan palm or European fan palm, is a single- to multiple-trunked  evergreen palm with an upright irregular form that typically matures as a shrub or small tree growing to 6-15’ tall with a spread to 6-20’ wide.  It often suckers from the base of the main trunk to form a clump of 8-10 trunks, but it can be easily trained to grow with a single trunk by regularly removing the suckers.  It is the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world, and the only palm that is native to Europe.  Notwithstanding its outdoor growth potential, it typically matures to only 5’ tall when grown indoors in containers.  It is native to rocky hills and mountains of the western Mediterranean Basin from Africa’s Atlas Mountains in Morocco, Algeria and Tunesia to Spain, Portugal, France and Italy.    

Huge, distinctive, triangular, fine-textured, palmate-compound leaves are ornamentally attractive.  Each leaf (to 24” long and as wide) has 10-20 narrow, finger-like, deeply divided leaflets which are arranged in the shape of a fan at the end of a spiny petiole (leaf stalk to 3-4’ long), hence the common name of fan palm.  Leaves are variable in both color (light blue green to silver green) and shape (shrub to small tree).  Bright yellow flowers bloom in spring, but are typically hidden from view behind the leaf stems.  Flowers are followed by dark yellow, orange or brown fruits that ripen in fall.  Flowers and fruits are somewhat inconspicuous and not showy.  Trunks on mature palms are covered with a dark mat of fibers and old leaf bases.

Var. humilis includes the type strain of the species.Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning dwarf and rhops meaning a bush.Specific epithet from Latin means low-growing.

Culture
In warmer areas where outdoor cultivation is possible, grow in light shade in well-drained soil. Indoor plants need bright indirect sunlight and watering well when in full growth. Keep moderately moist and temperatures above 45°F. Ideal temperatures are between 55° and 70°. Do not over fertilize as heavily fertilized plants may not form as many new plantlets. Your plants will not run short of nutrients; its tubers store reserve food. Cut off yellowed foliage and brown tips which will occur unless conditions are perfect. Plantlets form when the spider plant receives short days and long, uninterrupted nights for at least three weeks. This plant has fleshy tuberous roots, so it will need to be divided and repotted before the roots burst your container, especially plastic containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chlorophytum comosum is native to South Africa. It has linear leaves that are green or striped white. Flowering stems bear loose panicles of small, white, starry flowers. Plantlets are formed at the flowering nodes. When plants are full, they have an interesting, graceful, cascading habit.Genus name comes from the Greek words chloros meaning green and phyton meaning a plant.Specific epithet means furnished with a tuft.‘Variegatum’ has margins of white or cream. ‘Vittatum’ has recurved leaves with a central white stripe and green margins.
","
Problems
Plants are susceptible to root rot if waterlogged, whiteflies, spider mites, scales and aphids. Leaf tips turn brown from too little water, too low humidity, too much salts and excess of fluorides in the water. The foliage will also scald if placed in direct sun. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In warmer climates or during summer months in colder areas, spider plants are well-suited to use in planters or as a groundcover. The plantlets will cascade over a wall or planter forming a fountain effect. The variegated cultivars brighten up any shaded locations. It can be used as an edging along walks or in front of shrub borders. As an indoor plant, it is used primarily in baskets.

May be grown in containers (sow seed in spring) in a soil-based potting mixture with grit or sand added.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cocos nucifera, commonly called coconut or coconut palm, is a tall tree that is native to tropical islands in the western Pacific.  It has been commonly planted in frost free tropical areas throughout the world in a variety of conspicuous locations including coastal areas, beaches, parks, along streets, residential yards, near commercial buildings/hotels, and on golf courses.  In the U. S., it will grow in southern Florida, the southern tip of Texas and Hawaii.  It does not perform well in southern California.  Trees will typically mature to 50-100' tall over time.  This is a single-trunked palm with a branchless, often-curved, light gray trunk which is swollen at the base and topped by a crown of pinnate, downward-arching, green fronds (to 15-20' long).  Fragrant yellow flowers in elongated clusters to 4' long only appear in tropical climates where they bloom on and off throughout the year.  Female flowers are followed by single-seeded coconuts (to 14"" long).  Each coconut has a fibrous husk which surrounds a woody shell containing the coconut meat, milk and oil which are used in numerous food products around the world.  Drinkable coconut water is the liquid inside green coconuts.  Coconut milk is produced by grating the matue coconut meat, mixing it with water and then squeezing. Coconut meat can be eaten raw or cooked.  Dried coconut meat (copra) is crushed to obtain coconut oil with residue sometimes added to animal feed.  Coconut oil is used in cooking, cosmetics, soaps and margarine.  The growing tip of this palm can be harvested and marketed under the name of heart of palm, but harvesting kills the plant.   Other plant parts have a variety of uses, particularly in the Far East, including trunk (construction), fronds (weaving, baskets, thatching), endosperm (cosmetics) and sap (palm sugar or toddy).Genus name comes from the Portuguese word coco meaning mask.Specific epithet means bearing nuts.
","
Problems
Lethal yellowing is a serious disease which has killed thousands of coconut palms in Florida.  It is spread by a leaf hopper.  Injections help stabilize plants but will not cure the disease.  Resistant varieties are being developed.  Insect pest problems include palm leaf skeletonizer, aphids, nematodes and scale.  Spider mites.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Codiaeum is a relatively small genus of around 17 species of evergreen shrubs and small trees native to Southeast Asia and northwestern Oceania. Many cultivars are available for indoor and outdoor landscape use, and are prized for their colorful foliage.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Ternate vernacular name, kodiho.‘Mammy’ is characterized by curling, twisting, upright foliage, 1” wide by 8” long, forming a kaleidoscope of reds, yellows, and greens.  When grown outdoors, the best color is achieved in an area with full sun.  If the leaves start to show signs of sun scorch, relocate to an area with some afternoon shade.  'Mammy' is one of the smallest croton cultivars for the landscape, only reaching 3.5' tall.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale, spider mites and mealybugs.

Easily grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Performs well in sun-dappled shade.  In optimum growing conditions, it will spread rapidly by rhizomes, almost to the point of being weedy, to form dense colonies in the landscape. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, including dry and clay soils. This is a long-lived plant which naturalizes easily in woodland areas and may be left undisturbed for many years.  Flowering may decrease over time, however, at which point dividing the plants may become appropriate.  This is a cool weather perennial which is not recommended for growing in hot and humid summer climates south of USDA Zone 7a where it will perform poorly.  May easily be propagated in spring or fall by root division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Convallaria majalis, commonly known as lily-of-the-valley, is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial that that typically forms an indefinitely-spreading ground cover to 8-12” tall.  It is native to Europe, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized over time throughout much of temperate eastern and central North America plus parts of the Northwestern U.S.  Foliage and flowers make this an attractive and beloved shade garden wildflower.  Each plant has 2 to 3 parallel-veined lanceolate-ovate to elliptic green leaves (to 5-10” long and to 1-3” wide).  In spring, an erect to slightly arching flowering stem rises from the center of each leaf clump bearing a one-sided raceme (to 4-9” long) of nodding, bell-shaped, sweetly fragrant, white flowers (corollas to 1/3” long) which bloom in early to mid-spring.  Each raceme typically contains 5-10 flowers.  Globoid orange-red berries may appear in fall, each berry containing 1-6 seeds.

All parts of this plant are very poisonous because they contain cardiac glycosides.Genus name comes from the Latin word convallis meaning a valley.Specific epithet means of or belonging to May in reference to the month of flowering.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids and spider mites.  Stem rot, leaf spot, leaf blotch and anthracnose may appear but usually are not significant deterrents to growing this plant.  Foliage decline will occur in hot summers. Deer tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses
Best as a ground cover for shady areas where aggressive spread is desired.  May be too rambunctious for shady areas of rock gardens or borders.  Popular cut flower.  Performs well under the shade of trees and shrubs.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus alternifolia is a small deciduous tree or large multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-25’ tall with distinctive tiered/layered horizontal branching which is upward-turned at the tips.  It is native to both moist and dry forests, forest margins, stream banks and fields from Newfoundland to Minnesota south to northern Arkansas and through the Appalachians to Georgia and Alabama.  Small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers bloom in flattened cymes (each to 2 1/2"" across) in late spring (May-June).  Flowers give way to bluish-black fruits (drupes) on red stalks.  Fruits mature in late summer.  Elliptic-ovate, medium green leaves (to 3-5” long) turn reddish-purple often tinted yellow or green in fall.  Although the leaves of most species of dogwood are opposite, those of pagoda dogwood are alternate, hence the specific epithet and often used common name of alternate-leaf dogwood.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the alternate arrangement of the leaves.Common name of pagoda dogwood is in reference to the tiered horizontal branching.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus canadensis, commonly known as dwarf cornel or bunchberry, is a shrubby deciduous ground cover that typically grows to 4- 9” tall and spreads in the landscape by creeping rhizomes.  This dwarf species of dogwood produces the same shaped leaves and flowers found on the familiar Cornus florida tree except in smaller size.  In North America, it is primarily native to coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests throughout Canada and the northern U.S., south in the Appalachians to Virginia and in the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico.  This is a circumpolar species which is also native to eastern Asia.  

Conspicuously-veined, oval to elliptic, glossy, medium to dark green leaves (to 1-2” long) are located near the stem tops in false whorls of 4-6.  Red to purple fall color.  Flowers emerge in late spring.  Each flower consists of a tiny greenish-yellow umbel surrounded by four showy, oval, petal-like white bracts (each bract to 1” long).  Flowers give way to terminal clusters of berry-like drupes (1/4” diameter) which ripen in August to bright red with good persistence on the plant until late fall unless earlier consumed by birds.  Drupes are edible for humans.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is in reference to the native habitat of this plant which includes Canada.Common name of dwarf cornel refers to the red fruits which resemble in color the semi-precious gemstone carnelian (or cornelian).  Common name of bunchberry refers to the fruit clusters (berries in bunches).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus kousa, commonly called Kousa dogwood, is a small, deciduous flowering tree or multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-30’ tall, with a vase-shaped habit in the early years but eventually maturing to a more rounded form.  Bloom occurs in late spring.  The showy parts of the Kousa dogwood “flower” (3-5” across) are the four narrowly pointed petal-like white bracts which surround the center cluster of insignificant, yellowish-green, true flowers.  Flowers are followed by berry-like fruits (to 1” diameter) which mature to a pinkish red in summer and persist into fall.  Fruits are technically edible, but are usually left for the birds.  Oval, pointed leaves (to 4” long) are dark green, but usually turns attractive shades of reddish-purple to scarlet in autumn. Mottled, exfoliating, tan and gray bark on mature trees is attractive in winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is the Japanese name for this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. This plant has better disease resistance and better cold hardiness than flowering dogwood, Cornus florida, and is an excellent alternative to flowering dogwood in areas where dogwood anthracnose is a problem. In full sun locations, leaf scorch may appear, particularly if soils are allowed to dry out.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus racemosa, commonly called gray dogwood, is a deciduous shrub which is native to Missouri and typically occurs in moist or rocky ground along streams, ponds, wet meadows, glade and prairie margins, thickets and rocky bluffs. It grows 10-15' tall and features white flowers borne in terminal racemes (hence the species name of racemosa) in late spring and grayish-green, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves (2-4"" long). Foliage turns an interesting (but not always showy) dusky purplish red in fall. Terminal stems holding the flowers are distinctively red and provide interesting contrast to the clusters of small white berries which form after the flowers have dropped. Red stem color is more easily seen after the fruits are gone, and red color often persists into early winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being produced in racemes.

Clumps spread somewhat slowly by creeping rhizomes, but will form attractive colonies over time.  Foliage is evergreen south of USDA Zone 7 but basically deciduous in the St. Louis area.  As needed, cut back any remaining old foliage in late winter prior to the emergence of the new growth.  Propagate by division in early spring or fall.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Epimedium acuminatum is noted for its attractive narrow green leaflets with acuminate tips and its large, spider-type, purple and white spring flowers.  It is a rhizomatous perennial that typically grows on wiry stems to form a clump rising to 12"" tall spreading to 18"" wide.  It is native to alpine woodlands in western and central China (Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces).  Showy, spidery, nodding, long-spurred, columbine-like, purple and white flowers (1-2"" across) bloom in compound inflorescences (10-55 flowers per inflorescence) in spring (April-May) atop flowering stems rising above the foliage to 24"" tall.  Each flower features four showy spurred purple petals and eight sepals (four petal-like ovate-elliptic white inner sepals and four much smaller light purple outer sepals which drop at the time of bloom).  Each flowering stem bears two opposite trifoliate leaves.  Leaves are basal and cauline, usually with biternate but sometimes triternate leaflets.  Leaflets (to 4-7"" long) are narrow and ovate to lanceolate with spiny marginal teeth and cordate bases.  New leaves emerge in spring with a pink-maroon cast, but mature to medium to dark green.  Leaves form attractive foliage mounds.Genus name is of unclear origin and meaning but the Greeks used epimedion for a very different plant.Specific epithet means tapering into a long narrow point.Epimediums are commonly called bishop’s hat or bishop's mitre (four-spurred flowers of some species resemble a clergyman's biretta) or barrenwort (root extract was once believed to prevent female conception).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cupressus sempervirens, commonly called Italian cypress, is an evergreen conifer that is native to southern Europe and western Asia. In its native habitat, it typically grows in a spreading, open-horizontal form (sometimes referred to as var. horizontalis) that is rarely if ever sold in commerce. Trees commonly sold in commerce as Italian cypress are of the familiar narrow-columnar or fastigiate form that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. This columnar/fastigiate form (sometime referred to as C. s. var. sempervirens, C. s. ‘Stricta’ or Stricta Group), is unknown to the wild, but was the tree originally described by Linneaus as Cupressus sempervirens and is the cypress of classical literature that has been commonly planted in Italian classic gardens since Renaissance times. This columnar/fastigiate form features scale-like dark gray-green leaves on upright branches. Foliage is aromatic when crushed. Rounded fruiting cones (to 1.5” diameter).Genus name is the Latin name for Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens.)Specific epithet means ever green.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spider mites attack foliage in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Narrow columnar form is sometimes difficult to fit into residential landscapes. Good specimen around tall buildings.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10 (possibly including protected areas in Zone 8) where it is easily grown  outdoors in sandy, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to shade.  Perhaps best in part shade.  Appreciates a good mulch.  Superior soil drainage is needed.  Established plants tolerate some drought.  Plants also tolerate temperatures that briefly dip into the high teens but some frost damage to the foliage will occur.  Plants may not survive temperatures below 15 degrees F.  Plants sucker at the base.  Propagation is by suckers/offsets or seed.   Very slow growth, but plants live a long time.  Indoors plants should be planted in containers with a soil-based potting mix amended with sand and peat.   Site plants in filtered sun for 4-6 hours per day (as through a window curtain on an east, west or southern window).  Needs regular and consistent moisture with soil surface nearly drying  between water applications.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Notwithstanding the common name of sago palm or King Sago palm, this cycad is botanically closer to conifers than to palms.  This species in native to Kyushu (third largest Japanese island), the Ryukyu Islands and southern China.  It is a very slow-growing, symmetrical plant that produces a crown of shiny, arching, palm-like, evergreen palmate leaves atop a shaggy upright trunk.  Trunks take a long time to form (1"" diameter trunks may take years to eventually reach 12"" diameter).  Young plants typically grow to 2-3' tall over several years, but may take 50 or more years to eventually reach 10' tall.   Arching pinnate leaves (to 3-7' long depending on age) form a loose, feather-like rosette with leaflets to 7"" long.  Each leaf has a large mid-rib with very narrow, rigid, spiny-tipped, deep green leaflets.  Leaflets have revolute edges (margins rolled downward), hence the specific epithet.   Young sago palm plants produce leaves intermittently in several different growth spurts per year, however mature plants only produce leaves once per year.  Plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants).  Female plants will not produce seed without a nearby male, however these plants rarely flower when grown indoors in containers.  Males produce upright yellowish ellipsoid pollen cones (to 12-18"" tall).  Orbicular female cones produce vermilion seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a kind of palm.Specific epithet means means rolled back.

Established plants tolerate some dry soils. Plants bloom on old growth. Avoid heavy pruning. Prune to shape as needed in spring after flowering to stimulate growth of flowering spurs which will improve bloom for the following year (although such pruning will reduce fruit production for the current year). Promptly remove root suckers to control possible spread.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chaenomeles japonica, commonly called Japanese quince, is a low-growing, densely-branched, deciduous shrub with spiny, often-tangled, gray-brown twigs. It typically grows to 3’ tall but spreads to 6' wide. Five-petaled, orange-scarlet flowers (to 1.5” across) with creamy white stamens bloom before the leaves unfold in an often showy early spring floral display. Flowers are followed by hard, greenish-yellow fruits (1.5” pomes that are commonly called quinces) which ripen in early autumn. Ripe quinces are fragrant. Quinces are edible, but usually are considered too bitter to be eaten directly from the shrub. Quinces are sometimes used to make preserves and jellies. Coarsely-toothed, broad-oval, green leaves (to 2” long). No appreciable fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek words chaino meaning to gape and melon meaning an apple in the incorrect belief that the fruits split open.Specific epithet means Japanese.
","
Problems
Susceptible to fungal leaf spot (particularly in years with heavy spring rainfall) which can cause considerable leaf defoliation. Fireblight and scab can be problems in some areas. Aphids can cause significant damage to new growth. Lesser pests include scale and mites. Chlorosis (yellowing of foliage) will occur in high pH soils. Flower buds are susceptible to significant damage from early spring frosts.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is evergreen (roots may be hardy to Zone 8b). In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual in gardens or in containers. It is easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but prefers full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but is best in organically rich loams with good drainage. Seed is difficult to obtain. Nurseries and seed companies generally sell starts in small pots. Fresh stalks of lemongrass (leaves and roots absent) can also be purchased from grocery stores specializing in Southeast Asian cuisine for rooting in a glass of water. Plant outside in spring after last frost date. In fall just before first frost, stalks can be harvested (cut off top leaves and save 6-"" sections of the bulbous shoot bases) and frozen for culinary use during the winter. Several leaf sections with attached roots can also be divided and potted with top leaves removed for overwintering in a bright window. These saved sections can be then used as starts for the following year. Smaller container plants can be overwintered indoors in bright light locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cymbopogon citratus, commonly called lemongrass, is a frost-tender clumping perennial grass that is popularly used as a lemony flavoring in Thai, Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian cooking and is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for that purpose. It is also an outstanding ornamental grass that lends great beauty to garden areas regardless of whether its culinary uses are to be tapped. In the St. Louis area, it typically forms a dense rounded clump of foliage to 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall and as wide in one growing season. Gracefully-arching, strap-shaped linear leaves (to 3’ long and to 1” wide) are light green. Leaves emit a lemony fragrance when bruised. It rarely produces flowers. Extracted plant oils have been used for many years in herbal medicines and perfumes.Genus name comes from the Greek words kymbe meaning a boat and pogon meaning a beard.Specific epithet means resembling Citrus for the scent.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spider mites can be a serious pest on indoor plants.
","
Garden Uses
Rapid-growing ornamental grass for herb gardens, borders, along walkways or for tubs/containers. Harvest bulbous lower leaf sections for cooking. Though tough and inedible (unless finely minced or mashed in a mortar and pestle or food grinder), sections of the mature leaf blades may be used fresh or dried for flavoring teas, soups or stews.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this plant is best grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Shelter from strong winds.  Mulch in winter near the northern parts of the growing range.  Propagation is best done from division.  Some cultivars may be grown from seed.  This is a Mediterranean-type plant that grows best in temperate climates with cool summers and  mild winters.  It thrives in some parts of California.  Commercial production for globe artichoke is generally limited to USDA Zone 7 and south.   Plants may be grown north of USDA Zone 7 as annuals (either as ornamentals and/or for harvest of artichokes).  Some plants will not produce good buds when grown from seed as annuals (develop too slowly), but some cultivars (such as 'Imperial Star' PVP) develop buds so quickly (90 days after transplants are set out) that a good crop will reliably be produced from seed by late summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynara cardunculus (Scolymus Group), commonly called globe artichoke, is an upright columnar perennial vegetable which features lobed, jagged, deeply-serrate, green leaves and thistle-like flowers.  Scolymus Group was probably developed from cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) in ancient times.  In comparison to the species, Scolymus Group plants have larger flower heads, nearly spineless leaves that are less divided, and broader involucre bracts.  The vegetable part of this plant is the large unopened flower bud which contains the edible heart.  Flower buds appear year round in warm climates, with the major crop being in April-May and a lesser crop in fall.  In cold winter climates, the major crop is in fall.  Globe artichoke typically grows in a clump to 3' tall.  Flower stalks rise from the clump to 4-5' tall, each stalk topped by a large terminal flower bud with several smaller buds below.  Flower buds are harvested prior to opening.  If buds are not harvested prior to bloom, the buds will open to spectacular violet blue thistle-like flowers with diameters to as much as 7"".  Nearly all commercial artichoke production in the U.S. occurs in the State of California with 75% of that California production occurring in Monterey County.  Castroville, known as the Artichoke Capital of the World, celebrates an annual Artichoke Festival in May of each year.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means resembling a small thistle.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids, snails, slugs and blackfly may appear.  Watch for gray mold, powdery mildew or root rot.
","
Garden Uses
Globe artichokes may be grown as vegetables.  Buds are harvested prior to flowering.  For consumption, the bud is first steamed until the bracts are easily removable.  Bracts are then removed one at a time with the fleshy edible base on each bract being eaten.  Inedible choke is removed, leaving the heart.  Regardless of culinary value, this plant provides excellent interest to gardens for ornamental foliage and flowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyperus papyrus, commonly called papyrus, is native to Africa. It is a tall, clump-forming, tender perennial sedge that, in frost-free areas, will grow up to 15’ tall. In St. Louis gardens, stems will grow shorter (to 5-8’ tall). It features a grass-like clump of triangular green stems that rise up from thick, woody rhizomes. Each stem is topped by an umbellate inflorescence of 100+ narrow arching thread-like rays (4-12” long). Greenish-brown flower clusters appear at the ends of the rays. Flowers give way to brown, nut-like fruits. In ancient Egypt, the stems of this plant (considered by some authorities to be the bulrush of the Bible) were used to make a paper-like writing material also called papyrus.Genus name comes from the Greek word kypeiros which was the name given to some local sedges.Specific epithet is the Greek name used for paper made into rolls from this plant in Ancient Egypt.A dwarf version of this plant, designated as C. p. ‘Nanus’ or C. profiler, typically grows to only 2-3’ tall.

It typically grows to 30-40' tall with a broad-spreading, flat-topped, umbrella-like crown.  Crowns of mature trees often spread to 60-70' wide.  This tree is noted for featuring a superb ornamental display of showy scarlet flowers and compound mimosa-like leaves.  In the U. S.,  it can be grown outdoors in the far southern areas of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California plus Hawaii. This tree is deciduous in climates that have a dry season or mildly cool winter, but otherwise is evergreen.  Lacy, feathery, mimosa-like, bipinnately compound  leaves to 8-15"" long, each having 10-20 pairs of pinnae with further division into 25-35 pairs of  smaller pinnules.  Flowers (3-4"")  are a brilliant scarlet orange.  Each flower has four spreading petals and a larger fifth petal (the banner) which has streaks of yellow and white.  In the continental U. S., flowering typically occurs from late spring into summer.  Flowers give way to flattened bean-like fruit pods (each to 24"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek words delos meaning evident or conspicuous and onux meaning a claw and referring to the long-clawed petals.Specific epithet means royal.Common name of royal poinciana honors M. de Poinci, 17th century governor of the French West Indies.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Spreading crown is too large for many lots.  Vigorous root systems can lift sidewalks.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-9. This is a short-lived perennial that is perhaps best grown as a biennial. However, many gardeners simply purchase cold treated plants in spring and grow them as annuals. Moreover, many of the new cultivars will bloom the first year from seed if the seed is started early enough. Sweet William is best grown in deep, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun, but generally appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. In optimum growing conditions it will reseed each year and remain in the garden for many years as if it were a long-lived perennial. Double-flowered forms will not come true from seed, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flowers (shear back large plantings) promotes perennial tendencies. Seed may be planted directly in the garden in late spring for bloom the following year. Some nurseries sell seedlings in early fall that may be planted immediately for bloom the following year. Nurseries commonly sell plants in spring for flowering the same year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus barbatus, commonly called sweet William, typically grows 12-24” tall and features small flowers held in dense, flat-topped terminal clusters (3-5” wide). Many cultivars are available in commerce, including double-flowered forms as well as some dwarf plants (4-8” tall). Flowers come in vivid shades of red, pink, white and bicolor, sometimes with a contrasting eye, and with fringed petals that are bearded on the inside. Bloom from late spring to early summer. Flowers may be fragrant, although many of the newer cultivars have no scent. Lance-shaped medium green leaves (to 4” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means bearded or with long, weak hairs.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dimocarpus longan, commonly called dragon's eye or longan, is an evergreen monoecious tree that is native to Southeast Asia.  It typically matures to 30-40' tall with spreading branches.  It is commonly grown for its edible fruit in tropical/subtropical areas around the globe, particularly in China, India , Southeast Asia and Australia.  In the U.S., it will survive winters in southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii.  Glossy, evergreen, leathery, wavy-edged, pinnate compound leaves, with each leaf having 6-10 narrow leaflets in opposite pairs.   Small male or bi-sexual pale yellow to white flowers bloom in panicles in spring.  Spherical, edible, single seeded, sweet and juicy, grape-sized fruits (3/4"" diameter) in pendant clusters ripen to yellow-brown in summer to early fall.  Each single-seeded fruit reportedly resembles the eye of a dragon, hence the common name.  Fruits may be eaten fresh, cooked, dried or canned in syrup.

Easily grown as an indoor plant in St. Louis. Tolerates a wide range of indoor temperatures. For best results, place in bright indirect light locations protected from direct sun and drafts. Tolerates low light, but foliage loses best color in too much shade. Pot may be placed on a bed of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Use a loamy, peaty, well-drained potting soil. Keep soils uniformly moist during the growing season, but reduce watering from fall to late winter. Plants of different heights may be placed in the same container. Tall plants may be trimmed by removing the crown and rooting it.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dracaena marginata is a very popular houseplant that typically grows to 6’ tall or more over time unless pruned shorter. It features perhaps the narrowest leaves of the various species of dracaena sold in commerce. Slender gray upright stems are topped by tufts of arching, glossy, sword-shaped leaves (to 2’ long and 1/2” wide). Leaves are deep green with narrow reddish edges. Lower leaves fall off with age leaving distinctive diamond-shaped leaf scars on the stems. In its native habitat of Madagascar, this species grows as a shrub or small tree to 20’ tall. Fragrant tiny white flowers in spring are followed by spherical yellow-orange beries. Flowers and berries rarely appear on indoor plants. This plant is also sometimes called Spanish dagger or red-stemmed dracaena or Madagascar dragon tree. ‘Tricolor’ is a popular cultivar which adds a thin yellow stripe to each leaf.Genus name comes from the Greek word drakaina meaning a female dragon.Specific epithet refers to the plants distinctive leaf margin.

This is a vigorous, fast-growing plant that tolerates a wide variety of soils including both poor dry soils and wet heavy clays. Also tolerates wind, summer heat and saline conditions. Performs poorly in humid summer climates, however, and is not recommended for planting in the deep South (south of USDA Zone 7). Can spread by root suckers and self seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elaeagnus angustifolia, commonly called Russian olive or oleaster is native to Europe and Asia. It is a small, usually thorny, deciduous tree or large shrub that is typically grown for its silvery foliage, small fragrant yellow flowers, olive-like fruit and ease of cultivation. It has been widely planted in North America as both a windbreak and an ornamental. As a tree, it typically grows 12-20’ tall. It responds well to clipping and can be grown much shorter as a hedge. Branches and trunk are covered with exfoliating brown bark that is attractive in winter. Twigs are occasionally thorny. Narrow, willow-like leaves (to 2” long) are dark green above and silvery beneath. Angustifolia means narrow-leaved. Fragrant apetalous flowers with four lobed calyces appear in clusters of 1-3 in leaf axils near the base of new shoots in late spring. Flowers are silvery white outside and yellowish inside. Flowers are followed in fall by an often abundant crop of berry-like, silver-scaled fruit resembling olives, hence the common name. Fruit is edible, and is sometimes used for making preserves. Fruit is also attractive to wildlife. Although relatively tame in the St. Louis climate, Russian olive has aggressively naturalized in many parts of the West, particularly in watersheads and marshlands of the Great Plains where it has self-seeded and spread along rivers and wetland areas, crowding out native plants such as cottonwoods and willows, to the point where it is now being considered a noxious weed.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.

Problems
Canker and verticillium wilt are serious problems in some areas. Fungal leaf spot and rust may also occur.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erigeron is a genus of about 200 species of annuals, biennials and perennials from dry grassland and mountainous areas of predominantly North America. Erigerons are similar in appearance to and sometimes confused with asters.Genus name comes from the Greek words eri meaning early and geron meaning old man in reference to the early bloom time and downy plant appearance suggestive of the white beard of an old man.Plants in the genus Erigeron are often commonly called fleabane as a result of a once widely held theory that these plants repel fleas.'Darkest of All' is a hybrid erigeron cultivar which probably features E. speciosus as a prominent parent. It features large flowers (to 2"" across) with deep violet rays and yellow center disks atop stiff stems rising to 2' tall from a basal clump of lance-shaped green leaves (3-6"" long). Smaller lance-shaped stem leaves. Blooms in summer with some intermittent rebloom extending into early fall. 'Darkest of All' is a translation of the original German cultivar name of 'Dunkelste Aller'.
","
Problems
Some susceptibility to powdery mildew, leaf spots and rust. Erigeron often does not thrive in hot and humid summer climates such as found in the St. Louis area.

Culture
This annual is typically grown in home gardens for culinary use as a lettuce-like salad green.  It thrives in rich moist soils in full sun to part shade.  It is best grown during the cooler spring and fall months of the year rather than in the heat of the summer.  After last spring frost date, sow seeds in the garden a few inches apart in rows about 18” apart, with seedlings later thinned to a spacing of about 12”.  In the alternative, seeds may be started indoors in containers prior to last spring frost date for later transplanting outdoors.  Leaves must be harvested when young and tender.  Leaf flavor becomes strong and often bitter as the leaves mature.  A second crop can be planted in late summer for harvest before fall frost.  Although this annual may self-seed in the garden, it is usually recommended that seed be purchased rather than harvested from garden plants.  In St. Louis, seeds typically germinate in May with leaves harvested in early summer.  By contrast, this plant also grows as a winter annual, albeit sometimes an invasive one, in some other parts of the U.S. such as the deserts of Arizona where seeds typically germinate in the wild after fall rains for growth over winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eruca vesicaria, commonly known as by a number of common names including arugula, garden rocket, rocket salad, roka, roquette, rucola or rugula, is a Eurasian annual herb of the mustard family.  It was first cultivated by ancient Greeks and Romans.  It continues to be widely cultivated in Europe today, but has also been introduced into many other parts of the world including much of North America where it has become not only a treasured culinary plant, but also, in some cases, an invasive garden escapee and self-seeder.  It typically naturalizes in disturbed habitats, fields and meadows.  

Plants typically grow to 10-24” tall.  Irregular, pinnately-lobed, basal leaves, each with 4 to 10 small lateral lobes and a large terminal lobe, appear in rosettes.  Uppermost stem leaves are entire and smaller.  Four-petalled flowers (to 1” long) bloom in corymbs.  Each flower has a pale yellow corolla, yellow stamens, and dark brown or purple veins.  Fruit (to 1.5” long) is a seeded, prominently-beaked pod.  

Leaves should only be harvested when young and tender.  Older leaves become bitter and lose significant culinary quality as they mature. Young leaves lack bitterness and are typically eaten raw, adding a peppery, some say nutty, mustard-like flavor to a variety of food dishes including salads, sandwiches, egg dishes, sauces, soups or stir fries. Notwithstanding its culinary virtues, this plant is also extensively cultivated in central and western Asia for its seed oil which is used as a lubricant and illuminant in pickling. 

Subsp. sativa from Latin means cultivated in probable reference to the historical designation of this subspecies as a salad plant for cultivation in home gardens.

Some authors include this subspecies in with the species and others elevate it to its own species, Eruca sativa.Genus name probably comes from the Latin eructo meaning to eruct or belch in reference to the strong, spicy, sometimes bitter taste of mature plant leavesSpecific epithet comes from the Latin word vesica meaning bladder in reference to the inflated seed pods.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Flea beetles can be troublesome.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bassia scoparia f. trichophylla, commonly called burning bush, is an upright, shrubby, warm weather annual that is primarily grown for its attractive shape, light green foliage and bright scarlet red fall color. It typically grows in a single season to 2-3’ (less frequently to 5’) tall with a globular to columnar habit. Branches are clad with feathery, narrow, light green leaves (2-3” long) that turn scarlet red in fall. Flowers are inconspicuous. Plants have a cypress-like form and soft foliage, hence the sometimes used common name of summer cypress. This plant is native to temperate Asia, but has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of North America. Synonymous with and formerly known as Kochia scoparia f. trachophylla and Kochia trichophylla.Genus name honors Ferdinando Bassi (1714-1774), Italian botanist and director of the Bologna botanic garden.Specific epithet means broom-like.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia pulcherrima, commonly called poinsettia, is the most widely grown of all shrubby euphorbias.  In Mexico it is a straggly deciduous shrub. Inconspicuous yellow flowers are surrounded by large brilliant red floral bracts (modified leaves) in winter through spring. Contrary to conventional wisdom, poinsettia plants are not a poisonous plant. A Ohio State University study showed that a 50 pound child could eat 500 bracts and might have a slight stomach ache. However, the white sap can have allergic properties, especially for people who have latex allergies.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet means pretty.The common name of poinsettia recognizes Joel R. Poinsette (1775-1851) a gardener, botanist and diplomat from South Carolina who was ambassador to Mexico in 1824. He brought the plant back to South Carolina.
","
Problems
Problems may include whitefly, mealybugs, red spider mites and scale. Root or stem rots can also occur if overwatered. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Grown primarily as a pot plant, poinsettias are a big industry representing about 85% of potted plant Christmas season sales. The USA exports about 90% of the world’s poinsettia plants. It is thought that poinsettias are grown commercially in greenhouses in all 50 states and over 60 million plants are produced for sale.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fagus grandifolia, commonly called American beech, is native to eastern North America. It is a large deciduous tree typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 120’) tall with a dense, upright-oval to rounded-spreading crown. In Missouri, it occurs in rich woods of ravines, slopes and valleys only in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark). It is a low-branched tree with its mature trunk ranging from 2-3’ (less frequently 4’) in diameter. Trunks have distinctive thin, smooth, gray bark. Ovate to elliptic dark green leaves (to 5” long) have coarse, widely-spaced marginal teeth and prominent parallel veins, each vein ending at the tip of a marginal tooth. Foliage turns golden bronze in fall. Monoecious yellowish green flowers bloom in April-May, the male flowers in drooping, long-stemmed, globular clusters and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to triangular nuts enclosed by spiny bracts. Beechnuts ripen in fall and are edible.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means large-leaved.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fagus sylvatica, commonly called European beech, is a large deciduous tree typically growing to 50-60’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a dense, upright-oval to rounded-spreading crown. It is native to woodlands in central and southern Europe. European colonists brought this tree to America in the mid-1700s and it has been a popular ornamental shade tree since that time. European beech is primarily distinguished from the similar American beech (see Fagus grandifolia) by (a) smaller size, (b) darker gray bark, and (c) shorter leaves that have wavy mostly untoothed margins. It is a low-branched tree, with its trunk ranging from 2-3’ (less frequently 4’) in diameter. Trunks have distinctive bark that is thin, smooth and gray. Ovate to elliptic, lustrous dark green leaves (to 4” long) have wavy mostly toothless margins and prominent parallel veins. Foliage turns golden bronze in fall. Monoecious yellowish green flowers bloom in April-May, the male flowers in drooping, long-stemmed, globular clusters and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to triangular nuts enclosed by spiny bracts. Beechnuts ripen in fall and are edible. Many cultivars are available in commerce in a variety of different forms, leaf shapes and leaf colors.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means growing in woods or forest-loving.‘Pendula’ is a weeping cultivar that typically grows to 35-50' tall. It originated in England in about 1836. Lots of variation in shape between specimens. It typically is seen in two different forms: (1) upright central trunk that droops at the top with major branches extending outward horizontally before drooping sharply downward, sometimes reaching the ground, and (2) broad crown with spreading main branches and drooping side branches. Cultivar name comes from the Latin word meaning ""hanging down"" in obvious reference to the drooping plant branches.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Beech scale is an occasional problem. Watch for aphids, Japanese beetles and caterpillars. Distressed trees may be attacked by borers. Beech bark disease, canker and powdery mildew may occur.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade, but best foliage color is in full sun.  Tolerant of some drought and poor soils, but best performance occurs when plants receive regular and consistent moisture throughout the growing season.  Intolerant of wet, poorly-drained soils.  In the St. Louis area, foliage is semi-evergreen in that it may retain some color in mild winters, but clumps will show considerable browning in harsh winters.  Clumps tend to die out in the center and need to be divided and replanted or replaced every 2-3 years.  Cut back foliage in early spring to 3-4” to tidy clumps and to facilitate emergence of the new leaf blades.  Clumps may decline in hot, humid summers, and should be cut back if such occurs.  Mass densely (plant 8-10” apart) when planting as a ground cover since clumps spread outward rather slowly.  Species plants will self-seed in the garden.‘Klose’ should be propagated by division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Festuca amethystine, commonly known as tufted fescue, hair fescue or large blue fescue, is an evergreen to semi-evergreen, tufted, fine-textured, blue-green, cool season grass with thin hair-like blades that typically grows in dense fountain-like clumps to 12” tall.  Slender stalks rise above the foliage in late spring to early summer (June) to 18-24” tall bearing terminal panicles of amethyst (violet) flowers.  Color of the grass ranges from blue-green to gray-blue.  This grass is native to Central Europe.Genus name comes from the Latin word meaning a grass stalk or straw.Specific epithet means violet-colored.‘Klose’ is an ornamental cultivar that is noted for its attractive olive green foliage.  It typically forms a foliage clump to a compact 8” tall.  Foliage emerges bluish-green in spring, maturing to olive green.  It may bronze in hot summers.  Foliage typically forms a tuft of erect to arching, needle-like blades radiating upward and outward to a height of 6-8” (inflorescences typically bring total clump height to 10-14”).  Light green flowers with a purple tinge appear in terminal panicles atop slender stalks rising well above the foliage in late spring to early summer.  Flowers give way to buffy seed heads which some gardeners find attractive but others find detractive to both the symmetry of the plant and the foliage color. 

Cultivar name honors German nurseryman Heinz Klose.
","
Problems
Plants are short-lived and require frequent division.  Plant foliage may decline considerably in hot, humid summers. Wet soils in winter can be very harmful.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fothergilla gardenii, commonly known as dwarf fothergilla or coastal fothergilla, is a slow-growing, deciduous, dwarf ornamental shrub that is native to moist lowland coastal plain bogs and savannahs in the southeastern U.S. from North Carolina to the Florida panhandle and Alabama.  It is a compact, slow-growing, mounded, deciduous shrub that typically grows 2-3’ tall and as wide.  Apetalous flowers in dense terminal bottlebrush-like spikes (to 1-2"" long) bloom in spring (April-early May) before the leaves appear.  Only the male flowers have color (showy white filaments and yellow anthers).  Flowers are aromatic.  Thick, pubescent, oblong to obovate, blue-green to green leaves (to 2 1/2"" long) have marginal teeth from mid point to leaf apex and are rounded at the base.  Leaves turn often brilliant shades of yellow, orange and red in fall.  Fruit is an ornamentally insignificant, two-seeded, beaked capsule that matures in fall.Genus name honors Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), English physician and botanist who grew plants from around the world in his London garden.Specific epithet honors Alexander Garden (1730-1791), Scottish physician and plant enthusiast, who took up residence in Charleston, South Carolina in 1752 and first discovered, described and introduced Fothergilla gardenii to England.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Fothergilla major, commonly called large fothergilla, tall fothergilla or mountain witch alder, is a member of the same family as witch hazel (Hamamelis).  It is native to the southeastern U.S., primarily in mountain woods, ravines and along stream banks in the southern Appalachians in North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.  It is a slow-growing, deciduous shrub that grows 6-10’ tall with an upright spreading habit.  It is noted for its aromatic spring flowers, quality summer foliage, excellent fall color and excellent disease resistance.  Terminal, bottlebrush-like spikes (1-3” long) of tiny, fragrant, apetalous, white flowers bloom in spring (April-early May) after the foliage emerges.  Flower color comes from the dense clusters of showy stamens (white filaments and yellowish anthers). Ovate to obovate dark green leaves (2-4” long) are leathery above and blue-gray beneath.  Leaves are typically toothed in the upper 2/3 of the leaf.  Foliage turns excellent shades of yellow, orange and red-purple in fall.  Fruit is a non-ornamental, beaked, egg-shaped two-seeded capsule (to 1/2” long) which  matures in fall, eventually bursting and explosively broadcasting the seed.  Fothergilla major is very similar to Fothergilla gardenia (native to coastal plains in the southeastern U.S.), except, inter alia,  Fothergilla major is (1) taller, (2) produces flowers as the leaves emerge, (3) leaves have more marginal teeth and (4) leaves are less pubescent on the undersides.Genus name honors Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), English physician and botanist who grew plants from around the world in his London garden.Specific epithet means bigger or larger.'Arkansas Beauty' generally differs from the species by growing more compact and by producing foliage that lacks the pubescence and darker green cast of the species.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Prefers organically rich, sandy loams. Strawberries are a high maintenance fruit crop which can be grown all over the United States. Growing recommendations can vary considerably depending upon the climate, however, and varieties are often regionally adapted. Grow only certified disease-resistant cultivars. University Extension, University of Missouri-Columbia publishes a pamphlet called ""Home Fruit Production: Strawberries and Their Culture"" (G 6135) which provides some basic information on growing strawberries in Missouri and is available for inspection or purchase at the Center for Home Gardening.Plants generally dislike high summer heat, humidity and strong drying winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Strawberries are a mainstay of the home fruit garden and are grouped into Junebearing and everbearing types. Junebearers produce one crop per year early in the season (typically June).  The berries of Junebearers are normally larger than the berries produced by everbearing or day-neutral plants. They are sensitive to the length of day, and send out runners in spring as day length increases. Everbearing types produce a first crop in spring and then subsequent crops at six week intervals thereafter throughout the summer and into fall. Unlike junebearers, everbearers are not sensitive to the length of day. Both have five-petaled, white flowers with yellow centers. Flowers give way to large, glossy, red berries which mature in late spring to early summer.Genus name comes from the Latin word fraga meaning strawberry presumably from fragrans meaning fragrant in reference to the perfume of the fruit.'Mara des Bois' was hybridized in Soings En Sologne France in 1991 by strawberry breeder Jacques Marionnet in a planned breeding program involving a cross of (F. 'Gento' x F. 'Osara') x (F. 'Red Gauntlet' x F. 'Korona'). It is a remontant (everbearing) variety that produces fruit in summer to early fall in the first year, but in subsequent years produces a heavy spring crop with continued production throughout the growing season. Plants typically grow to 12-15"" tall and spread to 12-24"" wide. Conical red berries are plump, fragrant, sweet and exceedingly tasty.  Berries are small to medium (acorn size), which puts them in the category of being much smaller than most commercially grown berries but larger and firmer than tiny wild strawberries. U.S. Plant Patent PP8,517 was issued on December 28, 1993. This patent expires in September of 2011.
","
Problems
Strawberries are susceptible to a large number of potential diseases, including but not limited to: foliage diseases (leaf spot, scorch), root rots (red stele, black root rot), fruit rots (anthracnose, leather rot), gray mold and viruses. Tarnished plant bugs, mites, aphids, leafrollers, slugs, nematodes and strawberry weevils are occasional insect problems.
","
Garden Uses
Strawberries have little special ornamental value and are usually grown as a fruit crop in a specific area set aside for the same.May be grown in beds or containers (strawberry jars).  By reputation, 'Mara des Bois' has the best flavor and fragrance of any strawberry currently in cultivation.  Unfortunately, picked berries have a shelf life of only 5 days which is fine for home production or for local sales, but way too short a time for commercial production and shipment.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fragaria vesca, commonly called woodland strawberry, is a small-fruited, everbearing wild strawberry that is native to Europe and Asia. Varieties of the species are found in North America both naturally and as introduced. This is a compact, stemless, 4-8” tall plant that spreads indefinitely by runners that root as they go. Numerous, small, 5-petaled white flowers with yellow centers appear throughout summer. Tri-foliate, coarsely-toothed, green leaves. Flowers are followed by edible, bright red strawberries (1/2” long) that may be harvested throughout summer. Flowers and fruit are usually simultaneously present on plants in summer. Although Steyermark finds F. vesca var. americana to be present in Missouri, the common wild strawberry of Missouri is a similar species, F. virginiana var. illinoensis.Genus name comes from the Latin word fraga meaning strawberry presumably from fragrans meaning fragrant in reference to the perfume of the fruit.Specific epithet means edible.‘Alexandra’ is a small-fruited, woodland strawberry cultivar that is grown both for its ornamental value and its tasty berries. It features compact, 6-10” tall runnerless plants which make good edgers. Dense foliage mounds discourage many weeds. Numerous, small, 5-petaled white flowers with yellow centers appear throughout summer. Typical tri-foliate strawberry foliage. Flowers are followed by small bright red strawberries (1/2” long) which may also be harvested throughout summer. Berries are slightly larger than most other alpine/woodland types. Flowers and fruit are usually simultaneously present on plants in summer.
","
Problems
Strawberries are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including anthracnose, leaf spots, rots, wilts, powdery mildew and blights. Insect visitors include spider mites and aphids. Leaf scorch may occur in hot summer climates. This species has good resistance to the aforementioned diseases and insects.
","
Garden Uses
Woodland strawberry is generally grown for its ornamental features because the fruits are so small. Native plant gardens. Edger or groundcover. Rock gardens. Open woodland areas. Also may be grown in containers or pots.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Fraxinus excelsior, commonly called European ash or common ash, is native to Europe and western Asia.  It is a large, rounded, deciduous tree that grows to 70-80’ (less frequently to 140’) tall.   It is a popular landscape tree in Europe, but has not been very popular in the U.S., in part because of its susceptibility to borers.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word excelsus meaning lofty or high.
","
Problems
Emerald ash borer is native to Asia.  It was first discovered in the U. S. (southeastern Michigan) in 2002.  It has now spread to a number of additional states in the northeast and upper Midwest, and is expected to continue spreading.  Emerald ash borer will typically kill an ash tree within 3-5 years after infestation.  Once infestation occurs, it is very difficult to eradicate this pest which feeds under the bark and bores into wood.  This borer now constitutes a serious threat to all species of ash in North America.  European ash trees are generally susceptible to a number of additional insect problems including ash borer, lilac borer, carpenter worm, oyster shell scale, leaf miners, fall webworms, ash sawflies and ash leaf curl aphid.  Potential disease problems include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, rust, anthracnose, cankers and ash yellows.  General ash decline is also a concern.  Brittle branches are susceptible to damage from high winds and snow/ice.
","
Garden Uses
Planting new European ash trees is no longer recommended given the susceptibility of this tree to the emerald ash borer.  Ash trees have typically been used over time in a variety of applications including shade tree, street tree or lawn tree.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fraxinus pennsylvanica, commonly called green ash, has the largest growing range of any of the native ashes, extending from Nova Scotia to Alberta south to Florida and Texas.  This is a lowland species that is commonly found throughout the State of Missouri in low woods, floodplains and along streams, ponds and sloughs (Steyermark). It is a medium sized tree, typically growing 50-70’ tall.  Young trees are pyramidal in shape, gradually maturing to a more rounded but usually irregular crown.  Green ash is similar in appearance to white ash (see Fraxinus americana), except, inter alia, (a) flowers appear after the foliage emerges, (b) leaflet undersides are green, (c) leaflets are toothed from midleaf to tip and (d) leaflet stalks are winged.  Green ash is primarily dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Clusters of apetalous purplish male and female flowers appear on separate trees in April-May after the foliage emerges.  Fertilized female flowers give way to drooping clusters of winged samaras (to 2” long) that ripen in fall and may persist on the tree throughout winter.  Features odd-pinnate compound leaves, each with 5-9 leaflets. Oval to oblong-lanceolate leaflets (3-4” long) are medium green above and below.  Foliage turns yellow in fall, with the quality of the fall color often varying considerably from year to year.  Gray-brown bark develops distinctive diamond-shaped ridging on mature trees.   As with white ash, the wood of green ash is commercially used for a variety of products including tool handles, oars, garden furniture and sports equipment.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.Specific epithet means of Pennsylvania.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Becomes weedy and sparse with diminished flowering performance if not grown in full sun. Does poorly in wet, poorly draining conditions. Will adapt to clay soil if properly amended. In USDA Zones 5 and 6, this plant will often die to the ground in winter and therefore is often grown therein in the manner of an herbaceous perennial.  Even if plants do not die to the ground in winter, they often grow more vigorously, produce superior flowers and maintain better shape if cut close to the ground in late winter each year.  Prompt removal of spent flower spikes during the growing season will usually encourage continued bloom until frost.  This shrub will naturalize, sometimes aggressively, by self-seeding (seed dispersed by wind), particularly in areas where it does not die back in winter.  Where self-seeding is a potential problem, remove spent flower clusters prior to formation/disbursement of seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buddleja davidii, commonly called butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub that is native to thickets on mountain slopes, limestone outcrops, forest clearings and rocky stream banks in China.  It typically grows to 6-12’ (less frequently to 15’) tall with a spread to 4-15’ wide when not killed back by cold winter temperatures.  It is noted for its bushy habit, arching stems, showy/fragrant flowers and vigorous growth.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in the eastern U.S. plus Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii.  It has been declared a noxious weed in Oregon and Washington.  Aggressive spreading has been observed in a number of eastern states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina.   

Spike-like terminal and axillary flower clusters bloom from early to late summer, sometimes to first frost.  Flowers are densely clustered in showy cone-shaped panicles from 6-18” long.  In the wild, straight species flowers are lilac to purple with orange-yellow throats.  Numerous named cultivars have been introduced over the years, expanding the range of flower colors to include pinks, yellows, whites and reds.  Flowers (each to ½” long) are mildly fragrant, and, as the common name suggests, very attractive to butterflies.  Flowers are also very attractive to hummingbirds and bees.  Flowers give way to two-valved seed capsules that split open when ripe (about 50 seeds per capsule).  Finely toothed, elliptic to lanceolate leaves (6-10” long) taper to long points.  Leaves are sage green above and white tomentose beneath.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.

The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia.  However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet honors Pere Armand David (1826-1900), French missionary and naturalist, who found this species growing in China in 1869/1870 along the border of China and Tibet.Common name refers to the plant being very attractive to butterflies.'PIIBD-II', part of the First Editions® series, is commonly sold under the trade name of FIRST EDITIONS® FUNKY FUCHSIA™. It was selected by Michael Dirr of Plant Introductions, Inc. and is distributed by Bailey Nurseries. It is a rounded to upright shrub with dark green foliage that is gray underneath. FUNKY FUCHSIA™ has upright 6 to 8 in. (sometimes up to 10 in.) long branches of fragrant, reddish pink flowers that attract butterflies and bees and will bloom into fall if deadheaded. It grows 6 to 8 ft. tall and wide. The shrub can be rejuvenated by cutting it back to 1 ft. from the ground. U.S. Plant Patent applied for.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, humusy soils in part shade.  Grows particularly well under deciduous trees where exposure to the sun is full in early spring but gradually changes to part shade as the trees leaf out.  Snowdrops prefer cool climates, and are somewhat short lived when grown south of USDA Zone 7.  Plant bulbs 3” deep and space 3-4” apart in fall.  In optimum growing conditions, snowdrops naturalize well by both self-seeding and bulb offsets to form large colonies.  If left alone, foliage disappears by late spring as bulbs go dormant.  Allow foliage to yellow before removing it from garden areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Galanthus alpinus, commonly called snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial of the amaryllis family that blooms in February-March in the St. Louis area, often poking its flower heads up through snow cover.  It is native to forested areas of the Caucasus Mountains.  The common name refers to the purported resemblance of the flowers to drops of snow.  Each bulb produces two or three erect, narrow (to 3/4” wide), linear, basal leaves (to 4” tall at flowering but elongating to 7” tall after bloom) and a leafless flower scape (to 6” tall) which is topped in late winter to early spring (February-March) with a single, nodding, waxy, bell-shaped, white flower (to 1 1/4” long).  Each flower has six showy white petal-like tepals, with each of the three inner tepals (smaller than the three outer ones) being adorned with  a showy green chevron-like mark straddling a notch in the tepal apex plus green striping on the inner tepal surface.  Each seed has an attached fleshy structure (elaiosome) which is attractive to ants which in turn act as dispersal agents in distributing the seeds to other locations.  

Galanthus caucasicus is a synonym.Genus name comes from the Greek words gala meaning milk and anthos meaning flower in reference to the color of the flowers.Specific epithet from Latin means from the high mountains above timberline.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Geranium maculatum is a clump-forming, Missouri native, woodland perennial which typically occurs in woods, thickets and shaded roadside areas throughout the State. Forms a mound of foliage that grows to 24"" tall and 18"" wide. Features 1 1/4"" diameter, pink to lilac, saucer-shaped, upward facing, 5-petaled flowers in spring for a period of 6-7 weeks. Deeply cut, palmately 5-lobed, dark green leaves (to 6"" across). Flowers give way to distinctive, beaked seed capsules which give rise to the common name of crane's bill.Genus name comes from the Greek word geranos meaning crane in reference to the fruit which purportedly resembles the head and beak of a crane.Specific epithet means spotted.‘Espresso’ is a chocolate-leaved variety. It typically forms a loose mound of foliage to 24” tall and 18” wide. Lavendar, saucer-shaped, upward-facing, 5-petaled flowers (1.5” diameter) appear in spring to early summer for 6-7 weeks. But it is the chocolate leaves that are the distinctive feature of this cultivar.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Geum triflorum is a North American native prairie plant. Perhaps its most distinguishing feature is not the reddish pink to purplish, nodding, globular flowers that bloom in late spring, but the fruiting heads which follow. As the flower fades and the seeds begin to form, the styles elongate (to 2"" long) to form upright, feathery gray tails which collectively resemble a plume or feather duster, all of which has given rise to a large number of regional descriptive common names for this plant such as torch flower, long-plumed purple avens, prairie smoke, lion's beard and old man's whiskers. The feathery seed tails act as sails in aiding dispersal of the seeds. A soft, hairy plant growing typically to 16"" tall with fern-like, pinnately divided, green leaves (7-19 leaflets). Spreads by rhizomes and can be naturalized to form an interesting ground cover. Native Americans once boiled the roots to produce a root tea that was used medicinally for a variety of purposes such as wound applications and sore throat treatments.Genus name is the classical Latin name of the group.Specific epithet means three-flowered.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot can be a problem in poorly drained soils, particularly in winter.
","
Garden Uses
Mass on a prairie, meadow, native plant garden or naturalized area. Also can be grown in the border front.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture soil in full sun. Prefers moist, sandy, well-drained soils. Tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, including both alkaline and acidic soils and compacted soils. Also tolerant of saline conditions, air pollution and heat. Adapts well to most urban environments.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ginkgo biloba is a large, deciduous tree that matures to 100' tall and is considered to be a living fossil. It is the only surviving member of a group of ancient plants believed to have inhabited the earth up to 150 million years ago.  It features distinctive two-lobed, somewhat leathery, fan-shaped, rich green leaves with diverging (almost parallel) veins.  Leaves turn bright  yellow in fall.  Ginkgo trees are commonly called maidenhair trees in reference to the resemblance of their fan-shaped leaves to maidenhair fern leaflets (pinnae).  Ginkgos are dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Nurseries typically sell only male trees (fruitless), because female trees produce seeds encased in fleshy, fruit-like coverings which, at maturity in autumn, are messy and emit a noxious, foul odor upon falling to the ground and splitting open.Genus name is a misrendering of the Japanese gin meaning silver and kyo meaning apricot used in Japan in the 17th century.Specific epithet means two-lobed in reference to the leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Usually slow growing, with initial growth being somewhat sparse.

Best foliage color usually occurs in full sun, but plants will also grow in close to full shade. Prune regularly to stimulate new foliage growth and promote bushiness. Container plants should be overwintered indoors in a bright sun room. Container plants may also be forced into dormancy by cutting back foliage and storing in a dark, cool but frost-free basement or garage for the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Graptophyllum pictum, commonly called caricature plant, is most likely native to New Guinea. It is a tropical evergreen shrub that will grow to 6-9’ tall. Container plants in the St. Louis area typically grow as rounded 2-4’ tall plants. Caricature plant is primarily grown for its variegated foliage. Oval to elliptic leaves (to 6” long) are deep green varyingly blotched with cream along the midveins. Terminal clusters (3-4” long) of red to purple-red tubular flowers with protruding stamens bloom in summer. Flowers often do not appear on container plants, particularly if stems are regularly pinched to promote new foliage growth.Genus name comes from the Greek words graptos meaning painted or marked with letters or to write and phyllon meaning a leaf from the variegated markings on the leaves.Specific epithet means painted or brightly colored.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gypsophila aretioides, commonly known as alpine baby’s breath, is a low-growing, cushion-forming, evergreen perennial that is native to the Caucasus Mountains in northern Iran.  Tiny, fleshy, oblong, gray-green leaves (to 1/4” long) form a dense foliage mat that only rises to 2-3” tall.  Small, star-shaped, 5-petaled, white flowers bloom infrequently in June-July.  

Although some species of baby’s breath serve as mainstay filler plants (fresh bouquets and floral arrangements) for the floral industry and are sometimes commercially grown for that purpose, the within alpine cultivar is a dwarf plant that in most cases is much too small for any commercial floral use.Genus name comes from the Greek gypos meaning gypsum and philos meaning friendship in reference to this plant’s preference for high pH soils.Specific epithet means having similarity to plants in the genus Aretia.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best flowering is in full sun.  Prefers moist, acidic, organically rich soils.  Consistent moisture is best (leaf scorch may occur during periods of summer drought).  Shrubs have some tolerance for clay soils as long as drainage is good.  Promptly remove root suckers to prevent colonial spread.  It is particularly important to remove root suckers rising from below a graft union.  Prune in spring after flowering to control shape and size.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hamamelis is a genus of 5 to 6 species of deciduous shrubs from East Asia and North America. They are grow for their very early late winter through early spring bloom (H. virginiana flowers in autumn.) Plant them where you can enjoy their very early flowers and showy, yellow fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek words hama meaning at same time and melon meaning apple or fruit in reference to the occurrence of both fruit and flowers at the same time on this shrub (particularly in the case of fall flowering members of the genus).'Amethyst' was introduced in 2003 by Brotzman’s Nursery, Inc. in Ohio and named by Tennessee nurseryman, Don Shadow. It was raised from open-pollinated seed of 5 different witch hazel cultivars and is probably a H. vernalis hybrid. It has lightly fragrant, reddish purple blossoms in mid winter. It is a rounded bush that grows 8 to 10 ft. tall and wide with gray-green foliage that turns a brilliant red and orange in autumn.

Tolerates some drought, but produces best foliage color in evenly moist soils. In the St. Louis area, plants will benefit from a placement that will provide some protection from winter wind and sun and from hot summer temperatures. Plants may be propagated vegetatively or by seed. Birds help disperse seed. Spreading stems will root at the nodes where they touch the soil. Ground covers rarely need pruning except when they invade unintended areas. Ground covers may be trimmed on the edges with a spade or shears.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hedera helix, commonly known as English ivy, is a vigorous, aggressive, fast-growing, woody evergreen perennial that is primarily grown as a climbing vine or trailing ground cover.   As a climbing vine, it  may over time grow upwards to 50-100' in height.  As a ground cover, it typically grows to 6-9"" tall but spreads over time to 50-100'.  English ivy grows in two forms or stages:  (1) juvenile stage is the climbing/spreading stage (most often seen) in which plants produces thick, 3-5 lobed, dark green leaves (to 4” long ) on non-flowering stems with adventitious roots, and (2) adult stage is the shrubby non-climbing stage in which lobeless, elliptic-ovate, dark green leaves appear on rootless stems that do not spread or climb, but do produce round, umbrella-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in early fall followed by blue-black berries. Native to Europe, English ivy was brought to the U. S. by settlers in colonial days.  It has been and continues to be widely sold in the U. S. as an ornamental plant.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in a large number of eastern, midwestern and pacific coast states.  In some climates such as in the Pacific Northwest, it is considered by some to be an invasive invader of woodland and open areas where it often aggressively displaces native vegetation by densely smothering large areas of ground with its trailing densely-leaved stems or by climbing into tree canopies via clinging aerial rootlets.Genus name is the Latin name for ivy.Specific epithet from Greek means spiral or twisted.
","
Problems
Aphids, mealybugs, caterpillars, loopers and scale may appear.  Watch for leaf spots, canker, bacterial leaf spot, stem rot and powdery mildew.  Mites can be significant problem.  Climbing vines around homes easily crawl into unintended areas, curl around gutters and damage painted surfaces, loose mortar or aluminum siding if growth is not closely monitored.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helenium amarum, commonly known as bitterweed or sneezeweed, is an upright, aromatic, bushy annual of the composite family that typically grows to 12” tall, but less frequently rises to as much as 24”, on upright, striate stems which are many-branched above.  Stems are clad with alternate, wide-spreading and ascending, linear to linear-filiform, thread-like leaves (to 3” long but less than 1/8” wide) with resinous glands.  Daisy-like flowers (to 3” diameter) bloom from mid/late summer into fall (August-October), with earlier bloom typically occurring in warm winter climates.  Each flower features 5-10 wedge-shaped, golden yellow rays, each ray having three lobes at the tip.  Rays droop downward from a spherical yellow (occasionally brown) center disk containing numerous tiny disk florets.  

This genus is primarily found growing in sandy soils in the southeastern to southcentral U.S. from Virginia to Florida west to Missouri, Kansas and Texas.  However, it has spread over time and naturalized in many of the eastern, central and Great Plains states plus California.  It is currently found in a variety of habitats primarily including disturbed areas, upland prairies, plains, rocky glades, woodland margins, gravelly areas along railroad tracks, roadsides, pastures and sandy/gravelly ground.Genus name comes from the Greek name helenion which is the name of a Greek plant which honors Helen of Troy.  It is unclear as to the relevance of Helen of Troy to the within genus of plants which are exclusively native to North and South America.Specific epithet from Latin means bitter.Common name of bitterweed is in reference to this plant containing a toxic substance which causes milk to taste bitter when cows graze on the foliage.  

Common name of sneezeweed is reportedly in reference to a former snuff-like use of the dried and powdered flowers of this plant by members of some native American Indian tribes for treatment of blocked sinuses.

Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Foliage tends to bleach when grown in too  much sun.  Plants thrive in sun dappled shade under large trees.  For use as a ground cover, set starter plants 6-12"" apart.  Plants will spread by rhizomes to form large colonies.  Avoid overhead watering and thin plants periodically to promote good air circulation, particularly if plants have experienced problems with leaf blight.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pachysandra terminalis, commonly called Japanese pachysandra, is a shrubby, evergreen ground cover which grows 8-12"" high and spreads by rhizomes to form a dense carpet of rich, dark green foliage. Oval leaves (2-4"" long) appear primarily in whorls at the stem ends. Tiny white flowers in 1-2"" long, terminal (hence the species name) spikes bloom in early spring. Flowers are not particularly showy, but on close inspection are quite attractive.Genus name comes from the Greek words pachys meaning thick and aner or andros meaning  stamen with reference to the thickened white filaments.Specific epithet means terminal in reference to the flower location at the ends of the stems.'Green Carpet' is a more compact form (grows to 6-8"" tall) which produces darker green leaves with shinier surfaces.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf blight  is a potentially serious problem which can necessitate remedial fungicide applications.  Root/stem rot may also occur.  Watch for scale and mites.
","
Garden Uses
Extremely popular ground cover for a variety of shady locations in the landscape including areas under trees, foundations, around shrubs or along walkways. Mass on banks or slopes.

Culture
Heucheras are best grown in organically rich, humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade.  Parentage determines the best culture including optimum sun exposure.  Unfortunately, the parentage of many hybrids in commerce today is unknown.  Some hybrids will perform well in full sun, particularly in northern climates, but generally prefer some shade in the heat of the afternoon in southern locations.  If grown in full sun, consistent moisture is very important.  Scorch and general foliage decline may occur if soils are allowed to dry out.  On the other hand, some hybrids perform well in shady locations, particularly if H. americana is a parent.  Remove stems of faded flowers to encourage additional bloom.  Foliage is essentially evergreen in warm winter climates.  In cold winter climates such as St. Louis, the amount of retained foliage color in winter depends in large part upon the severity of the temperatures.  A winter compost mulch applied after the ground freezes will help prevent root heaving.  Divide clumps in spring every 3-4 years.   Species plants may be grown from seed, but hybrids are usually divided in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heuchera, commonly called coral bells or alumroot, is a genus consisting of about 55 species of evergreen to semi-evergreen herbaceous perennials which are all native to North America.  Plants grow in a variety of different habitats including woodland areas, Appalachian seeps, prairies, rocky cliffs and alpine slopes.   Plants range in size from dwarf alpine plants with flower spikes rising to only 5” tall to much larger woodland plants with flower spikes towering to 36” tall.  Species plants are primarily native to the West, particularly in the Rocky Mountains, with a few species extending into northern Mexico.  However, some important species are native to woodland areas in the East and Southeast.

The first significant hybrid heucheras were introduced into commerce around 1980, with the volume of new introductions increasing to almost avalanche proportions in recent years.  Hybrids have now supplanted species plants in the marketplace.   Species plants most frequently used in producing the hybrids of today are H. sanguinea, H. americana, H. micrantha, H. villosa and H. cylindrica.   Leaves of hybrid plants are available in an expanded variety of colors including various shades of green, blue-green, violet, purple, maroon, bronze, silver-black, orange-yellow, yellow, or red, but often with a streaked, mottled or marbled variegation which sometimes includes bold contrasting veins.  Flowers of hybrid plants are also available in a variety of different colors including various shades of white, pink, coral or red.Genus name honors Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677-1747), physician, botanist and medicinal plant expert at Wittenberg University, Germany.‘Amber Waves’ is a vigorous, clump-forming coral bells cultivar that is best noted for its ruffled, amber leaves. It is the result of a tissue culture of a petiole off a gold leaf found on a Heuchera ‘Whirlwind’. This is a clump-forming perennial which features large, ruffled, amber gold leaves and light rose-pink flowers. Rounded, lobed, long-petioled leaves form a basal mound (to 8” tall) which may spread to 17” wide. Best foliage color occurs in spring. Tiny, very light pink flowers borne in open, airy panicles appear in late spring to early summer on slender, wiry stems rising above the foliage mound (typically to 12” tall). U.S. Plant Patent PP13,348 was issued on December 10, 2002.

Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun.  Best in moist, organically rich soils, but does surprisingly well in average garden soils as long as those soils are not allowed to dry out.  Deep and consistent watering is advisable.  Tolerates some light shade, but full sun with good air circulation produces best flowers, strongest stems and the best environment for resisting potential diseases.  Site in locations protected from wind to minimize risk of wind burn.  Deadhead individual flowers immediately to maintain plant appearance.  Cut back stems to approximately 3-4 inches in late autumn.  New growth shoots are slow to emerge in spring.  However, once new growth begins, it proceeds quite rapidly and plants will benefit from regular fertilization during the growing season.  May be propagated by division or cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hardy hybrid hibiscus is a vigorous, sturdy, erect but sometimes shrubby, woody-based perennial that typically grows to 4-8’ tall.  Hardy hybrid hibiscus plants are often complex mixtures of different species which are native to the U.S., including H.  coccineus, H. laevis, H. militaris, H. moscheutos and H. palustris.  Hybrids are winter hardy to USDA Zones 4 or 5 which significantly distinguishes them from the many tropical to semi-tropical hibiscus on the market today.   Each disc-shaped flower (to 6-10” across) features five flat showy overlapping petals (each to 3-4” long) in a variety of colors which surround a prominent and showy central staminal column.  Individual flowers remain in bloom for only one day, but one or more flowers usually open each day, in  succession, over a long mid-summer to early fall (sometimes to first frost) bloom period.  Each plant can produce up to 250 flowers per growing season.  Heavily, deeply-cut, irregularly serrate, glossy dark green leaves have reddish stems.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.‘100 Degrees’ is a vigorous, sturdy, rounded, somewhat shrubby, woody-based hibiscus cultivar that typically grows to 3-4’ tall and features dinner plate-sized, 5-petaled, hollyhock-like flowers (to 9” diameter) which are among the largest flowers produced by any perennial which is hardy to the St. Louis area. Flowers are light pink with red eyes. Each flower has a prominent and showy pale yellow central staminal column.  Plant patent applied for (PPAF).
","
Problems
Some susceptibility to leaf spots, blights, rusts and canker.  Japanese beetles, sawflies, whiteflies and aphids are occasional insect visitors.  Japanese beetles can severely damage foliage if left unchecked.  Leaf scorch will occur if soils are allowed to dry out.  Healthy plants grown in the proper environment usually do not need staking. Deer tend to avoid this plant.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. In St. Louis, wax plant is easily grown as a houseplant. It is best grown in a standard, loamy, well-drained potting mix. It may be trained to a small trellis or framework. Site in bright light with at least 1/2 day of direct sun. Tolerant of curtain-filtered sun and bright indirect light. Good light is necessary for flower production. Pots should not be rotated or moved to another location after flower buds appear. Water plants moderately but consistently throughout the growing season, allowing the soils to become nearly dry between water applications. In winter, plants require less bright light, less watering and tolerate night temperatures to 50F degrees. Do not remove the flowering stalk after bloom because new flowers will form on the old spur.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hoya carnosa, commonly called wax plant or honey plant, is a climbing or trailing perennial of the dogbane and milkweed family. In St. Louis, it is typically grown as a houseplant. It grows 2-4’ indoors. Trailing stems will climb counterclockwise around wire or other thin trellis-like structures. Stems will also trail from hanging baskets. Plants feature glossy, elliptic, fleshy, dark green leaves (to 4” long) and tight rounded clusters (umbels) of fragrant white summer flowers. Each tiny flower (to 1/2” diameter) sports a distinctive, star-shaped, red-centered corona. Each cluster may include from 10-30 flowers. Wax plant is native to India, China and Australia. The genus name honors Thomas Hoy, late 18th century gardener to the Duke of Northumberland.Genus name honors Thomas Hoy, late 18th century gardener to the Duke of Northumberland.Specific epithet means fleshy.Common name refers to the waxy flowers and leaves.‘Variegata’ features leaves with creamy white margins and sometimes a pink tinge.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, rich soils, but has some tolerance for drought.  This vine is dioecious (separate male and female plants), so some male plants are needed (if seed is desired) in order for the female plants to produce seed.  Plants die to the ground each winter, but perennial roots survive to send up new growth each spring.  Stems may be pruned to the ground in autumn after a hard frost.   Propagate by cuttings of runners emanating from the crown.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Humulus lupulus, commonly known as common hop, is a dioecious, rhizomatous, twining perennial vine that is grown commercially for harvest of female fruits which are used by breweries to preserve and flavor beer.  It is also an easy-to-grow ornamental plant that can be grown on a variety of support structures.  This vine is native to Europe, southwestern Asia and North America.  Hops grown commercially in the U.S. are the European variety which has now escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas.  Common hop grows rapidly each year to 15-20' long on rough stems clad with lobed leaves.  Yellow-green male flowers bloom in catkins.  Female flowers and subsequent seeds are born in cone-like structures (strobiles) which mature in late summer to early fall.  Strobiles are typically collected in September-October with the seeds dried for use in the manufacture of beer.  Flowers emit a pine-like fragrance and are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from a Medieval name of the hop plant that has apparently been Latinized.Specific epithet literally means small wolf but his plant was was once called willow-wolf as it would be found climbing over willow trees.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Needs a support structure on which to climb. Skin contact may cause dermatitis.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, acidic, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Does best in full sun, but easily tolerates open woodland conditions.  Plant bulbs 4-6” deep and 6” apart in fall.  Tolerates clay soils.  Plants need regular moisture during the periods of spring growth and bloom, but will tolerate drier conditions after bloom as the plants head for summer dormancy.  Best left undisturbed once planted.  In the alternative, plants can be grown from seed, but will not bloom until the 3rd or 4th year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camassia scilloides, commonly known as wild hyacinth, eastern camas or Atlantic camas, is a spring-flowering bulbous perennial that typically grows to 1-2’ (less frequently to 3’) tall.  It is native to a variety of habitats including low rich woods, wet open woodlands, open meadows, stream banks, limestone glades, ledges, rocky slopes and prairies, often on calcareous soils, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin south to Georgia and Texas.  

Narrow, linear, grass-like, sharp-pointed leaves (to 12” long by 1/2” wide) form a basal foliage clump from which rises a naked flowering stalk to 2’ tall topped by a terminal raceme (4-12” long) of fragrant, pale blue to white flowers which bloom sequentially from the bottom of the raceme to the top in April-May.  Each flower (to 1” across) has 6 linear to elliptic tepals, 6 yellow-anthered stamens, and a green ovary with a central style.  Each raceme typically holds up to 20 flowers.  Each fertilized flower gives way to a 1/3” seed capsule.  Basal leaves turn yellow and wither after flowering as plant appearance declines on its way to a mid-summer dormancy.  

Bulbs of several different species of Camas, including the within species, once served as an important food for several different native American Indian tribes plus early settlers and explorers of North America.  

The bulbs of C. scilloides are edible (raw, baked, roasted or boiled) and were once a significant food source for some native American Indians and early North American explorers/settlers.  However, it should be noted that the bulbs of a very similar plant commonly known as death camas (Zygadenus nuttallii) are very poisonous if ingested.  Unfortunately the bulbs of these two genuses are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other by observation.Genus name is derived from the Native American Indian name of kamas or quamash for a genus plant whose bulb was once used by native Americans and settlers as a food source.Specific epithet is in reference to a purported resemblance between plants of the genus Camassia with plants of the genus Scilla.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Plants stems are strong and seldom need support.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or plant in groups of at least 15 bulbs in wildflower meadows, open woodland areas or borders.  May not deserve a prominent place in the border, however, since foliage becomes rather scruffy in appearance after bloom on its way to mid-summer dormancy.  May also be utilized as an accent on the periphery of a water garden or pond.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade.  Tolerates full sun only if grown with consistent moisture.  Can adapt to a variety of soil conditions, but intolerant of drought. The foliage tends to decline considerably in dry conditions. Plants may die to the ground in harsh winters.  Bloom occurs on new wood, so plants may be pruned back close to the ground in late winter to revitalize and to encourage vigorous stem growth and best form.  If not pruned back, any weakened and/or damaged stems should be removed in early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hydrangea arborescens, commonly known as smooth hydrangea or wild hydrangea, is a loosely and widely branched deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ (less frequently to 10’) tall.  It is native to moist or rocky wooded slopes, ravines, streambanks and bluff bases from New York to Florida west to Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Louisiana.  Gray-brown stems are clad with opposite, broad egg-shaped to rounded, sharply toothed, dark green leaves (2-6” long) with pale green undersides.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Tiny white fertile flowers bloom in May-July in flattened hairy clusters (corymbs to 2-6”across).  Scattered continuing flowering may occur throughout summer to September.  A few large sterile flowers usually appear at the cluster margins (usually not enough for a quality lacecap effect).  Flowers give way to dehiscent seed capsules which ripen in October-November.The genus name Hydrangea comes from hydor meaning ""water"" and aggeion meaning ""vessel"", in reference to the cup-like capsular fruit.Specific epithet comes from arbor meaning tree in reference to the similarity of this shrub to a small tree.
","
Problems
Many species of hydrangea, including this one, are susceptible to bud blight, bacterial wilt, leaf spots, mold, rust and powdery mildew.  Watch for aphids, mites, scale and nematodes.  Pruning stems back to the ground in late winter each year helps promote stem vigor. Rabbits tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9.  If attempted in the St. Louis area, it should be sited in a protected location (e.g., south side of a building) and given a good winter mulch.  Where winter hardy, it should be grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in locations protected from cold winter winds.  Part afternoon shade is best in hot summer climates.  Avoid poorly drained soils.  This holly is a good selection for the deep South because it has tolerance for heat and periods of drought.  Prune in winter if needed.  Plants of this species are dioecious (separate male and female plants).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex cornuta, commonly called Chinese holly, is native to China and Korea. It has naturalized from garden plantings in North Carolina and Alabama. It is a broadleaf evergreen that typically grows as a shrub to 8-10’ tall, but may be trained as a small tree to as much as 25’ tall. Unusually shaped rectangular leaves (to 4” long) have three large spines at the apex. Dull white flowers appear in May. Flowers are fragrant but generally inconspicuous. Pollinated flowers give way to berry-like red drupes (1/3” long) which ripen in fall and persist into winter. Birds are attracted to the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet means horn or horn-shaped.
","
Problems
Potential insect problems include holly leaf miner, spider mites, whitefly and scale. Potential disease problems include leaf spot, leaf rot, tar spot and powdery mildew. Plants are also susceptible to leaf drop, leaf scorch and chlorosis (yellowing of leaves in high pH soils). Winter hardiness is a significant problem in St. Louis.
","
Garden Uses
Effective as a specimen or in small groups or as a hedge. Foundation plantings. Foliage and fruit provide good color for the winter landscape.This species is infrequently found in commerce, but a number of popular cultivars are commonly sold.

Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun.  Tolerates some light afternoon shade, particularly in hot and humid summer climates.  Tolerates neutral to slightly alkaline soils.  Established plants tolerate some drought.  Plants may suffer tip damage or die to the ground in harsh winters of USDA Zone 5, but usually will come back nicely in spring.  Flowers bloom on new growth.  Several pruning options exist.  As is often done with Buddleja, plant stems may be cut back close to the ground in late winter to early spring each year before new growth appears.  Another option is to simply prune stems back to live wood in early spring of each year.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Indigofera amblyantha, commonly called indigofera or indigo, is a deciduous, spreading shrub that is native to forest margins and streambanks in central to south central China.  It typically grows in a rounded form to 4-6' tall and as wide.  It is perhaps best noted for producing a very long bloom (May to September) of attractive pale lilac to rose to pink pea-shaped flowers in narrow vertical racemes (2-5"" long) growing from the leaf axils.  Flowers are followed by dark purple seed pods.   Each compound odd-pinnate leaf (4-6"" long) has 7-13 ovate gray-green leaflets (each to 1 1/4"" long).   No appreciable fall color.Genus name comes from indigo plus Latin fero meaning to bear. The dye indigo is obtained from this genus.

Culture
This is a tender perennial vine that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.  In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual in moist, well-drained soils in full sun.  This vine needs a support structure upon which to grow.  It is easily grown from seed.  Start seed indoors about 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date.  Notch seed coat with a knife before planting to promote better germination.  Seed could be started outdoors after last frost date, but the onset of bloom would occur unacceptably late in summer.  Take new young plants outdoors about 1-2 weeks after last spring frost date.  Once established, growth is rapid.  Seeds may be harvested in fall, but only mature seeds that have fully ripened on the vine are of value.  Plants grown in containers can  be brought inside in fall for overwintering, albeit with some difficulty, but most gardeners simply start new seed indoors each spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea mauritiana, commonly known as morning glory, is a vigorous, twining, tuberous-rooted, tender perennial vine that may be grown in St. Louis as a warm weather annual.  It is native to montane forests, thickets, streambanks, seashores and waste places in southern China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, New Guinea, the Philippines, and Pacific Islands, but is now distributed throughout the Pantropics.  It is noted for its funnel-shaped pink to reddish purple flowers (to 2"" across) with darker throats which bloom in axillary or terminal cymes on stems clad with circular leaves (to 6-8”) that are palmately divided into 5-7 acuminate, elliptic to lance-shaped segments.  Vines can grow to 30' long or more in tropical areas, but will typically reach 10-15’ in one year when grown as an annual.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet is in reference to the island nation of Mauritus located in the Indian ocean.

Plant rhizomes, depending on location, from late July through October (late July–early September in areas with cold winters or September-October in areas with mild winters).   Plant rhizomes 12-20” apart.  Plant each rhizome shallowly over a baseball-sized mound of soil with 1/3 of the rhizome above the soil and with the roots horizontally spread to support the plant.  Growth comes from the leafy end of the rhizome.  If overcrowding occurs over time, lift the clump in late summer (August) with a garden fork, divide and replant.  Keep the iris bed free of weeds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tall Bearded Iris is a rhizomatous iris class whose numerous hybrid cultivars grow to heights above 27.5” tall featuring two or more branches and 7 or more blossoms per stem with flowers spreading to more than 5” wide.  Each flower has upright standards and pendant falls.  Flowers bloom in June (St. Louis).  Most cultivars produce plants significantly taller than 27.5”, with many rising to 38-40” tall.  Bearded name comes from the bushy beard which is easily visible in the middle of each fall.  Plants typically form clumps in the garden over time. Flowers bloom in an almost unlimited variety of different colors and color combinations.  Narrow, linear green leaves are substantially erect.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.‘America’s Cup’ is a tall bearded iris that typically grows to 40” tall and slowly spreads by rhizomes. Flowers are white and ruffled with white beards. Flowers are fragrant and bloom in spring. Sword-shaped, linear, green leaves. McWhirter, 1989.
","
Problems
Leaf spot, root rot, bacterial soft rot, crown rot and mosaic viruses may appear.  Watch for slug, snails, whiteflies, aphids and thrips.  Iris borers can cause significant problems in areas where they are found.

The major insect pest of bearded iris is iris borer. Major disease problems are bacterial soft rot and fungal leaf spot. Good sanitation practices are the most important component of any disease/insect control program: promptly remove and destroy diseased foliage/rhizomes, promptly remove and destroy borer-infected foliage/rhizomes and perform an annual clean-up of all debris and foliage from beds in fall after frost. The most frequent causes of failure to flower or sparse flowering are (1) rhizomes are planted too deep, (2) plants are located in too much shade, (3) plants were given too much fertilizer or (4) plants have become overcrowded and need division.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Soil needs to stay relatively dry in summer in order for the bulbs to set buds for the following year. Plant bulbs 3-4” deep and space 3-4” apart in fall. Bulbs tend to separate into offsets or bulblets after bloom (particularly when planted shallowly), with each new bulblet requiring several years to mature. Although bulbs can be dug and divided (offsets removed) after bloom, it is probably best to do this only if flowering has significantly declined. In order to insure consistent flowering from year to year, it is an option to plant supplemental bulbs each fall, or to grow this plant as an annual by planting new bulbs each fall.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris reticulata, commonly called reticulated iris, is a bulbous perennial iris that is native to Turkey, the Caucasus, Northern Iraq and Iran.  It is a low-growing purple-flowered reticulate or netted iris that blooms in March to early April in the St. Louis area, at about the same time as snowdrops (Galanthus), glory-of-the-snow (Chionodoxa) and the early crocuses.  Striking purple 2.5” diameter flowers with gold crests and white streaks on the falls appear on naked stems (scapes) typically growing to 6-8"" tall.  Flowers have a sweet fragrance.  Narrow, linear, 4-sided, grass-like leaves (usually 2-4 per plant) typically rise to the same level as the flower at the time of bloom, but elongate to 12-15” after bloom before eventually disappearing by late spring as the plant goes dormant.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet is in reference to the netted or reticulate pattern on the dry bulbs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Fusarium basal rot is an infrequently occurring disease problem.

Culture
Easily grown in moist, fertile, humusy, organically rich, neutral to slightly acidic, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Siberian iris is an adaptable plant which tolerates a wide range of soils, including boggy ones, but will generally perform well in average garden soils.  Avoid soils that are too wet or too dry.  In too much shade, plants tend to produce fewer flowers and foliage tends to flop.  Best with consistent moisture from the onset of spring growth until several weeks after the flowers fade.  Continue irrigation after bloom, however, to keep foliage clumps attractive.  Rhizomes should be planted 1-2” below the soil surface and 1-2’ apart.  In cold winter regions, plant the rhizomes in early spring or late summer.  In mild winter regions, plant the rhizomes in fall.  Divide plants as needed when overcrowding occurs and decreased flowering is evident.  Remove flowering stems promptly after bloom unless the seed pods are considered to be an attractive addition to the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Plants in the Siberian iris group are chiefly of hybrid origin, primarily being derived from two blue-flowered Asian species, namely, I. sibirica (central Europe to northeastern Turkey and southeastern Russia) and I. sanguinea (Russia, Korea and Japan).  Arching, narrow, grass-like, linear, blue-green leaves form a vase-shaped foliage clump to 2’ tall.  Flowering stems rise above the foliage to 3’ tall in May-June, each stem bearing 2-5 flowers in colors which primarily include blue, lavender, purple and white, but sometimes yellow, pink and wine.  Each flower features upright standards and flaring to drooping falls.  In comparison to bearded varieties, Siberian irises have smaller beardless flowers, narrower grass-like leaves and an absence of thick fleshy rhizomes.  After bloom, the foliage clump will retain its blue-green color into the fall, often displaying showy leaves reminiscent of some ornamental grasses.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.'Baby Sister' rises on stiff stems to a height of only 6"". Flowers are violet blue veined darker on the falls with a white signal on the falls. Makes a good parent for short Siberian iris.
","
Problems
Siberian irises are generally pest-free, with very little susceptibility to the two main problems of bearded iris, namely iris borer and bacterial soft rot.
","
Garden Uses
Mixes well with other perennials in borders.  Also effective when planted along a slope or hillside, along a path or along a stream or pond margin.  A good moisture-loving plant for moist garden areas.  Massed plantings and well-placed specimens can enhance almost any setting, and the foliage provides lasting beauty after bloom.  Excellent cut flower, but usually lasts only two days.

Train as a vine on a support structure or sprawl along the ground. When grown as a ground cover, plants will spread less aggresively in poor, lean soils. Prune as needed in early spring just after flowering is completed. If renovation is needed, cut back hard to 18-24” or replace plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jasminum nudiflorum, commonly called winter jasmine, is a trailing, viny shrub that grows from a central crown. As a shrub, it typically grows in a sprawling mound to 4’ tall with arching branches, and spreads by trailing branches that root as they go along the ground. As a vine, it typically grows to 10-15’. Willowy green stems are attractive in winter. Non-fragrant, bright yellow flowers bloom along the stems in late winter before the leaves. Compound, trifoliolate, dark green leaves with ovate leaflets (to 1.25” long).Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet means with flowers coming before the leaves.

Non-invasive clumping bamboo.  Winter hardy to USDA Zone 9b (needs a protected locations in 9a).   Plants will not survive significant frost.  Best in full sun to part shade.  Likes deep, rich, consistently moist soils with even watering.  Avoid overly wet soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bambusa ventricosa, commonly called Buddha bamboo or Buddha Belly, is a tropical clumping bamboo of the grass family.  It is native to southern China where it typically matures on thick-walled stems (to 2 1/4” diameter) to 55’ tall.  In the U.S., it is grown in the ground in parts of southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii where it typically matures to a somewhat shorter 30-45’ tall.  This bamboo has cylindrical jointed stems and usually persistent leaf sheaths.  Linear lanceolate leaves grow to 7” long.

This species is, however, popularly grown in containers and tubs in subtropical regions around the world where it assumes a much more compact form to only 5-8’ tall with stem diameters to 1 5/8”, featuring not only shorter stems, shorter internodes and smaller leaves, but also showcasing internodes that are distinctively swollen or bulging in an ornamentally attractive fashion, hence the common name of Buddha belly.  The swollen internodes are basically caused by stress to the plant (e.g., limited available root space of a container, poor soil, inadequate water).Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Malayan vernacular name.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word ventricosus/ meaning swollen on one side (pot-bellied).

Culture
Prefers moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Intolerant of shade. Difficult to transplant because of deep taproot. May be grown for its edible nuts. Although young trees will sometimes begin producing nuts when only 4-6 years old, it usually takes 20 years before a tree will produce a large crop of nuts.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juglans nigra, commonly called black walnut, is a large deciduous tree typically growing 75-100’ (less frequently to 125’) tall with and an oval to rounded crown. Mature trees characteristically have long trunks, often with an absence of lower branching. Fissured, sharply ridged, dark gray-black bark forms diamond patterns. Black walnut is native from Massachusetts through southern Ontario to South Dakota south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rich woods, in valleys along streams and in open upland woods throughout the state (Steyermark). Features odd-pinnate compound leaves (to 24” long), each with 13-23 oblong to lanceolate leaflets. The terminal leaflet is often missing. Leaves are late to emerge in spring and early to drop in fall. Leaves are strongly aromatic when crushed. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow. Yellow green monoecious flowers appear in late spring (May-June), the male flowers in drooping hairy catkins and the female flowers in short terminal spikes. Female flowers give way to edible nuts, each being encased in a yellow-green husk. Nuts mature in autumn, falling to the ground where the husks blacken as they rot away. Kernels are edible but hard to extract. Black walnuts are harvested for commercial sale. The wood from this tree is highly valued for a number of commercial uses including cabinets, furniture, gunstocks and fine veneers. It is perhaps the best furniture wood available from any native American tree. Overharvesting of trees for the wood has greatly reduced the native populations in the wild. Native Americans used the nuts for food and boiled the tree sap for syrup. They also reportedly threw the husks into ponds to poison fish, making them easier to catch.Genus name comes from the Latin names jovis meaning of Jupiter and glans meaning an acorn.Specific epithet means black, in reference to the dark bark and nuts.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Potential diseases include anthracnose, bacterial blight, root rot, canker, leaf spot and shoot dieback. Watch for aphids, fall webworm and a variety of foliage chewing caterpillars. Black walnut roots produce chemicals called juglones which are very toxic to certain other plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, peonies and solanaceous crops (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes). Most of the toxicity is limited to within the drip line of the tree, but the area of toxicity typically increases outward as the tree matures. Nuts can be quite messy in fall. Husks can stain clothing and sidewalks.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus conferta, commonly called shore juniper, is a decumbent evergreen shrub that is native to certain sandy coastal areas of Japan and Sakhalin Island (Russia). It is a dense, low-spreading plant that grows 10-18” tall and spreads by creeping, branched stems over time to 6-8’ wide. It is noted for its attractive, aromatic, awl-shaped, blue-green foliage featuring spiny-pointed blue-green needles (to 5/8” long) in groups of three. Fleshy, blackish, berry-like seed cones acquire a silvery bloom at maturity.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet conferta comes from the Latin word for crowded in reference to the foliage.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Junipers are generally susceptible to blights (dieback of stem tips), particularly in unusually rainy/wet springs. Phomopsis twig blight is of particular concern. Cedar-apple and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers. Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils. Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, twig borers, webworms and scale. Watch for spider mites. Foliage on mature plants will sometimes die back in the center. Susceptible to winter injury when temperatures dip below minus 10 degrees F.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus sabina, commonly known as savin juniper, is a shrubby evergreen conifer that is native to mountain areas of central and southern Europe to the Caucusus.  It is usually seen in the wild as a spreading shrub to 4-6' tall and to 5-10' wide.  Foliage is dark green with no purplish color in winter.  Crushed foliage releases an unpleasant aroma.  Brown bark on mature stems peels in strips.  Although species plants are rarely sold in commerce (not particularly ornamental), a number of cultivated varieties have become popular ornamental landscape plants.  Sabin juniper leaves come in two types:  scale-like (adult) and awl/needle-like (juvenile).  Cones (pollen and seed-bearing) usually appear on different plants.  Male plants produce catkin-like pollen cones.  Female plants produce fleshy, berry-like, bluish-black seed cones.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet comes from the name of an ancient people who lived in central Italy, the Sabines.
","
Problems
Savin junipers are generally susceptible to tip and needle blights.  Cedar-apple rust and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers.  Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils.  Canker may attack bark or main stems.  Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, webworms, borers and scale.   Watch for spider mites.

Raised plantings should be considered in order to promote better drainage.  Plants do not grow well in heavy clay soils.  Remove spent flower clusters immediately after bloom.  Prune lightly after bloom to promote bushy growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kalmia latifolia, commonly called mountain laurel, is a gnarled, multi-stemmed, broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that is native to Eastern North America (New England south to the southern Indiana, Louisiana and the Florida panhandle) where it is found in a variety of habitats including open rocky or sandy woods, cool meadows, balds, mountain slopes and woodland margins.  It is noted for its excellent spring flowers and quality year round foliage.  It typically grows as a dense rounded shrub to 5-15’ tall, opening up and developing gnarly branches with age.  Notwithstanding its usual shrub habit, mountain laurel will rarely grow as a small tree (particularly on slopes in the Appalachian Mountains) to as much as 30’ tall.  Flowers appear in terminal clusters (corymbs to 6” across), typically covering the shrub in late May-June for several weeks with an often exceptional bloom.  Each flower (to 1” across) is cup shaped with five sides and ranges in color from rose to white with purple markings inside.  If not deadheaded, flowers give way to non-showy brown fruits (3/16” dehiscent capsules) that persist into winter.   Elliptic, alternate, leathery, glossy evergreen leaves (to 5” long) are dark green above and yellow green beneath and reminiscent to the leaves of rhododendrons.  All parts of this plant are toxic if ingested. Kalmia latifolia is the state flower of Connecticut.  

Mountain laurel has acquired a number of different common names over time including ivy bush, spoonwood, calico bush and American laurel.  Linnaeus named the genus herein after Swedish botanist Peter Kalm (1716-1779) who explored plant life in parts of eastern North America from 1747 to 1751.Genus name honors Pehr Kalm (1715-1779), Finnish pupil of Linnaeus, who was sent by the Swedish government in 1748 to report on the natural resources of North America.Specific epithet means broad-leaved.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Performs best in humusy, compost-enriched soils in alpine areas to 7,000’ in elevation.  Tolerant of drought, but prefers even moisture in the summer growing season.  Intolerant of wet, heavy soils, particularly in winter.  Locate in areas protected from strong wind.  Promptly remove spent flower spikes to encourage additional bloom and to maintain the integrity of the planting.  Winter hardy to USDA Zones 6-8 (possibly Zone 5).  Foliage remains evergreen in frost-free climates, but will show significant damage in colder winters.  Crowns benefit from a protective mulch in winter in USDA Zones 5 and 6.  Tie leaves together in late fall to form a canopy over the crown in order to prevent water from settling in the crown and freezing.  Cut back foliage to 3” in early spring in anticipation of the new growing season.  Established clumps are best left undisturbed.  Plants may be grown from seed and will self seed in the landscape to form colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kniphofia caulescens, commonly known as red-hot poker or torch lily, is an upright, clump-forming, rhizomatous, evergreen perennial that is native to grassy slopes, often in marshy sites and seepage areas, in the Drakesberg Mountains of South Africa and Lesotho (landlocked country encircled by South Africa) at elevations above 3,000’ where it is often found growing in huge colonies.  

From an 18-24” tall basal tuft of coarse, narrow, linear, sword-shaped, evergreen to semi-evergreen, bluish-green leaves (to 3' long and 1"" wide) rise one or more thick, leafless flower scapes (no support needed) which soar well above the foliage clump to 3-4' tall.  Each scape is topped with a dense, showy, bottlebrush-like spike (scapose terminal raceme to 6-10"" long) of drooping, short-stalked, tubular flowers which bloom in summer (July-August).  Buds and emerging flowers are coral red but mature to yellow (bottom to top), giving each spike a two-toned appearance.  Flowers bloom in summer (July-August).  Common names refer to the purported resemblance of each flower spike to a red hot poker or torch.Genus name honors Johann Hieronymus Kniphof (1704-1763) German physician and botanist.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words caulos meaning having a well-developed stem and -escent meaning like.

Will self-seed in the garden, but cultivars may not come true to form.  If plants become leggy, shear back to 4-6” or to new fresh basal leaves in order to shape plants and to promote new foliage growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lamium galeobdolon, commonly known as yellow archangel or golden dead-nettle, is a stoloniferous spreading perennial of the mint family (opposite leaves and square stems) that typically grows to 9-15” tall but spreads by stem fragments, rooting at the nodes, and spreads to 18” wide or more.  It is native to shaded woodlands, copses and thickets throughout much of Europe and western Asia.  It has been introduced into parts of the U.S., often escaping into the wild where it persists and spreads as a weed, typically outcompeting native plants.  It has been declared a non-regulated Class B noxious weed in parts of the State of Washington where it cannot now be legally sold.  

Yellow archangel forms a loose mat of foliage which spreads indefinitely.  Small, tubular, two-lipped, asymmetrical, yellow flowers (each to 3/4” long) bloom in 2-10 flowered verticillasters on short axillary stalks in late spring (April-June).  Each flower has some reddish-brown markings on the lower lip.  This plant trails along the ground by creeping runners (stolons) as a ground cover, but will climb in an almost vine-like manner over low growing vegetation and tree stumps, typically rooting in the ground at the nodes when they come in contact with the soil.  Sprawling to erect stems are clad with toothed, ovate to rounded, cordate-based, medium to dark green leaves (1-3” long) with pointed tips.  Leaves are aromatic when crushed.  Leaves are sometimes variegated with silver-gray markings.  Leaves are semi-evergreen in warm winter climates, but deciduous in the colder parts of the growing range.

Lamiastrum galeobdolon is a former name currently considered to be a synonym.Genus name comes from the Greek laimos or lamos meaning throat in reference to the throat-like appearance of the corolla.Specific epithet has several possible origins.  It may come from the Latin words galeo meaning to cover with a helmet and dolon meaning a fly’s sting.  On the other hand, it may come from the Greek words gale meaning weasel and bdolos meaning fetid smell (weasel-snout is a sometimes used common name for this plant).Archangel is the primary common name for this plant in reference to the wing-like shape of the leaves.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where plants will thrive outdoors as sprawling, low-growing shrubs featuring continuous bloom throughout the year. Plants are easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants tolerate part shade, but best flowering is in full sun. Plants thrive in lean, sandy, slightly-dry soils. In St. Louis, plants must be grown as annuals or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool locations. Another option is to take cuttings in late summer from favorite plants for overwintering. Many gardeners elect to purchase new plants each spring in 6-packs rather than trying to overwinter plants or cuttings from the previous year. Container plants are less tolerant of dry soils than plants grown in the ground, and accordingly should be watered regularly and never allowed to dry out.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Lantana montevidensis, commonly called trailing lantana or weeping lantana, is native to tropical areas of South America. In frost free areas, it grows as a low, trailing, woody shrub to only 12-20"" tall, but spreads by vine-like stems to 5' wide or more. It is typically grown as a dense ground cover. It features hairy, opposite, coarsely-toothed, ovate, dark green leaves (unpleasant aroma when bruised). Leaves can be a skin irritant. Clusters (to 1 1/2"" across) of tiny lilac to purplish-pink flowers with yellow throats bloom profusely throughout the year in frost free areas. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. In St. Louis, trailing lantana is grown as an annual, with flowers blooming from spring to fall frost. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. Trailing lantana has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the southern U.S. including Florida, the Gulf Coast and southern California. It can spread invasively in frost free areas, but appears to be somewhat less invasive than its close relative Lantana camara. Genus name comes from the Latin name for viburnum. This species was reportedly discovered in Montevideo, Uruguay, hence the specific epithet.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Viburnum transferred to this genus.Specific epithet means of Montevideo, Uruguay.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew may occur, particularly if plants are grown in less than full sun locations. Leaf spot and stem rot may also occur. Watch for whiteflies and spider mites, particularly on overwintering plants.
","
Garden Uses
Flowering, shrubby, low-maintenance ground cover for frost-free areas. Good for erosion control on banks or hillsides. Where not winter hardy, it serves as an excellent annual for bedding or ground cover. Cascading stems make this a superior selection for hanging baskets, containers or growing along the tops of walls.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Larix decidua, commonly called European or common larch, is a deciduous conifer although it looks like a needled evergreen in summer. It is a large tree that will grow to 60-100’ tall with a pyramidal shape, horizontal branching and drooping branchlets. Shape becomes broader and more irregular with age. It is perhaps best noted for its soft green foliage that turns golden yellow in fall before dropping. Needles (to 1.5” long) appear in tuft-like clusters. Erect reddish brown cones (to 1.25”) are covered with brown hairs. Bark on mature trees is scaly, furrowed and reddish-brown. This is an important timber tree in Europe. It is native to cool mountainous regions from the Alps to the Carpathians. Other deciduous conifers include dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).Genus name is the classical name for larch trees.Specific epithet means deciduous.

Winter hardy to USDA Zone 7 where it is easily grown in average, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.   Appreciates part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Apply a thick winter mulch in areas near the northern edge of the growing range to protect the root system.  Shrub stems will typically freeze to the ground in winter when temperatures dip below 15 degrees F, but new stems will likely rise up from a protected root system in spring and rapidly grow back to as much as 6’ tall by summer.  Whether or not winter stem freezing occurs, plant appearance can often be greatly improved by a late winter pruning of stems to as far back as 6-12” from the ground without fear of flower loss because flowers appear on new growth.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Litchi chinensis, commonly known as lychee, is an evergreen monoecious tree with a dense rounded crown that is native to southern China.  It is noted for producing an excellent tasting globose to ovoid red fruit.  Cultivation of this fruit tree (particularly cultivars thereof) now occurs in tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world including southern Florida, California and Hawaii.  It will grow to 110' tall in its native habitat, but usually grows slowly in cultivation to only 20-30' tall over the first 25-30 years.  Pinnate compound glossy lime green leaves, each with 4-8 pointed lanceolate leaflets in pairs, are evergreen.  Yellow flowers in long terminal and axillary panicles (separate male and female flowers in each panicle) bloom in spring.  Flowers are followed by globose to ovoid fruits which turn red when ripe with inner white translucent flesh.   Fruits typically mature June -July (sometimes to September).  Fruit is eaten fresh when in season, made into preserves, dried (lychee nut), pickled, or frozen with little loss of flavor.  Lychee was introduced from China to Hawaii in 1850s.  In Hawaii, the tree is grown both commercially for fruit production and as a landscape tree for both shade and fruit harvest.Genus name comes from the Chinese name for the tree that produces the well-known fruits.Specific epithet means Chinese.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Lobelia cardinalis, commonly called cardinal flower is a Missouri native perennial which typically grows in moist locations along streams, sloughs, springs, swamps and in low wooded areas. A somewhat short-lived, clump-forming perennial which features erect, terminal spikes (racemes) of large, cardinal red flowers on unbranched, alternate-leafed stalks rising typically to a height of 2-3' (infrequently to 4'). Tubular flowers are 2-lipped, with the three lobes of the lower lip appearing more prominent than the two lobes of the upper lip. Finely-toothed, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 4"" long). Late summer bloom period. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds, but not cardinals. White and rose colored forms are also known.Genus name honors Matthias de l'Obel (1538-1616), French physician and botanist, who with Pierre Pena wrote Stirpium Adversaria Nova (1570) which detailed a new plant classification system based upon leaves.Specific epithet means scarlet or cardinal red.Common name is in reference to the red robes worn by Roman Catholic cardinals.

Culture
Best grown in organically-rich, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Shrubs will take full sun in the northern parts of the growing area, but appreciate some afternoon shade in hotter southern parts of the growing area.  Shredded bark mulch will help soils retain moisture.  Consistent moisture is important in the early years of development.  Shrubs will show some drought tolerance only after root systems are well-established.  Shrubs are winter hardy to USDA Zones 2-6 or 2-7.  South of Zone 7, plants often will not receive enough chilling hours in winter to grow well and produce abundant fruit. Shrubs are unisexual (not self fertile).  Compatible plants should be planted in pairs or groups in order for pollination and fruit set to occur.  Prune if needed immediately after harvest of fruits.  Shrubs will not sucker in the landscape.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lonicera caerulea, commonly known by a variety of common names including blue honeysuckle, honeyberry, sweetberry honeysuckle, and haskap, is a circumpolar, multi-branched, deciduous shrub that is native to moist boreal forest areas, mostly in peaty soils, in northern temperate climates in Asia, Europe and North America.  

This shrub in general is unlike many of its honeysuckle relatives in that it produces an edible, tasty, blueberry-like fruit.  It typically grows to 4-6’ tall and as wide.  Opposite, elliptic to ovate, glaucous green leaves (each to 2-3” long) have slightly wavy leaf margins.  Pale yellowish-white flowers (to 5/8” long) bloom in late spring to early summer (April-June) in pairs along the shoots.  Fruits ripen in early summer to deep blue with reddish-purple insides.  Fruits are pruinose with an oval-teardrop to almost-globose shape.  

Variability in growing characteristics results in part from the large geographic distribution of this shrub.  Some current confusion exists regarding differentiation between varieties/subspecies.  Some experts have identified as many as 9 different varieties, but other experts have instead divided the species into 4 different
subspecies.  Cultivars with improved characteristics are available in commerce.Genus name honors Adam Lonitzer (1528-1586), German botanist, the author of an herbal (Kreuterbuch) many times reprinted between 1557 and 1783.Specific epithet means dark blue in reference to fruit color.‘Blue Moon’ is a compact shrub that typically grows to 2-3’ tall.  Small, funnel-shaped, slightly fragrant white flowers bloom in early spring followed by cylindrical-rounded, blueberry-like, dark blue fruits which ripen in May-June.  Soft, velvety, dark green foliage is attractive throughout the growing season.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew may occur.
","
Garden Uses
Fruit garden.  Hedge.  Uncommon in commerce.  Berries may be eaten directly off the shrub or harvested for use in a variety of foods including pastries, jams, jellies, juices, wines, ice cream, and sauces.

Culture
Easily grown in wet soils in full sun to part shade.  This plant is a native U.S. wetland plant that thrives in marshes, bogs, and the mucky banks of ponds, lakes and water bodies, including locations in shallow standing water to 24” deep in the eastern half of North America.  It often colonizes in damp ground near shorelines.  This plant can spread rapidly.  It is considered to be an emergent aquatic plant in stagnant, slow-moving water.  Plants will clonally reproduce whenever the stem tips dip to touch moist ground or water.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Decodon vertilicillatus, commonly known as swamp loosestrife or water willow, is a multi-stemmed, woody-based, sub-shrub that typically grows to 6-8’ tall in a variety of wetland areas ranging from swamps to areas where plants are partially submerged in standing water to as much as 24” deep.  It is native to marshes, water margins, peaty bogs, sloughs, swamps and shorelines along ponds, small lakes and fens, from Ontario and central Maine south to Florida and Louisiana north along the Mississippi River to the Missouri bootheel and southern Illinois.  

Slender, recurved to arching, usually unbranched, wand-like stems grow to 3-8’ long.  Stems of plants growing in water margins will typically arch over the water in an ornamentally attractive fashion.  Stems are clad with toothless, nearly stalkless, elliptic-lanceolate to lanceolate, opposite or whorled, willow-like leaves (each to 1 1/2 to 6” long and to 1” wide).  Showy, bell-shaped, five-petaled, deep pink to rose-purple flowers (1” across) bloom in dense clusters in the upper leaf axils during July-August.  Each flower has five petals, 5-7 sepals and 10 stamens.  Fruit is a rounded capsule.  Plants may form sizeable clumps at the edges of lakes and streams.  Leaves acquire often attractive shades of red, orange and yellow in fall.   Despite the willow-like leaves, this plant is not related to willows. 

D. verticillatus is the only species in this loosestrife family genus.Genus name is from Greek decas meaning odous","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Japanese beetles can be problematic in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Moist to wet soils in sun.  Not a good plant selection for small gardens.  It is useful as a waterside plant in large landscapes.  Willow-like leaves arch gracefully over water margins.  Hedge.  Single specimen.

Species plants will flower in the first year from seed and therefore may be grown as annuals.‘Eco Dark Satin’ will not come true from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lysimachia congestiflora, commonly called dense-flowered loosestrife or golden globes, is a prostrate, mat-forming herbaceous perennial that grows to only 3-6” tall but spreads in the garden by creeping stems to 12” wide or more to form a dense medium green ground cover accented from late spring to mid-summer by showy cup-shaped bright yellow flowers.  It is native to ditches, roadsides, edges of rice paddies, and damp forest margins in China, Bhjutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sikkim, Thailand and Vietnam. Stems are clad with opposite to whorled, ovate to broad-ovate medium green leaves (to 1 1/2” long).  Leaves are semi-evergreen to evergreen in warm winter areas where temperatures do not drop below 15 degrees F.  Some species plants with colorful variegated leaves have been found growing in the wild.  Cup-shaped, 5-petaled, yellow flowers (to 3/4” wide) bloom in terminal clusters (3-8 flowered racemes) from late May to July.Genus name honors King Lysimachus (661-281 B.C.), Macedonian King of Thrace and is derived from lysimacheios which was the ancient Greek name of a plant in this grouping.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words congestus meaning congested and flos meaning flower in reference to the flower clusters.‘Eco Dark Satin’ is a cultivar selected and introduced into the U. S. by Don Jacobs (1917-2010) of Eco Gardens.  It differs from the species by having dark green leaves with burgundy overtones, yellow flowers with distinctive red throats, and a somewhat longer late May to September bloom time.

Culture
Easily grown in humusy, moist to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Plants prefer some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  This is an aggressive perennial of wetland areas which can spread invasively by creeping rhizomes and self-seeding to form large colonies which displace native vegetation and disrupt habitat needed by certain types of waterfowl and fish.  Eradication of the underground rhizomatous network present in established plant colonies can be difficult.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lysimachia vulgaris, commonly known as yellow loosestrife or garden loosestrife, is a rhizomatous perennial that grows to 3-4’ (less frequently to 6’) tall on stiff upright stems clad with pubescent, ovate to lance-shaped, opposite or in whorls of 3-5, medium green leaves (to 4 1/2” long and 1” wide) which are dotted with black to orange oil glands.  It is native primarily to wetland areas of Europe and Western Asia.  It was introduced into North America in the early 1900s as a garden ornamental, but has since that time escaped gardens and naturalized in a number of damp habitats including marshlands, fens, wet woods, pond/lake margins, stream banks, waste places, ditches and along roadsides in Canada (Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia) and northern parts of the U.S. (Maine to Minnesota south to Illinois, Kentucky and Maryland plus Colorado, Montana, Washington and Oregon).  

Cup-shaped, five-petaled, primrose-like, bright yellow flowers (to 1” across) bloom primarily in terminal panicles from June to September on soft hairy stems.  Each flower has 5 yellow petals with reddish brown near the petal bases.  Flowers are followed by 1/4” wide seed capsules which split open when ripe.    

In the State of Washington, L. vulgaris is listed as a Class B noxious weed and is also listed on the Washington quarantine list meaning it is unlawful to transport, buy, sell, offer to sell, or to distribute this plant into or within the State of Washington.Genus name honors King Lysimachus (661-281 B.C.), Macedonian King of Thrace and is derived from lysimacheios which was the ancient Greek name of a plant in this grouping.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning common.Even though its common name is yellow loosestrife, Lysimachia vulgaris is a member of the primrose family and is unrelated to Lythrum silicaria, aka the infamously invasive purple loosestrife, which is a member of the loosestrife family.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Lysimachia is susceptible to rust and leaf spots.  Plants should be closely monitored to avoid unwanted spread in the landscape.
","
Garden Uses
Notwithstanding its long and showy bloom of bright yellow flowers, this plant should not be grown in areas where it is expected to spread invasively.  It is best located in moist areas separated from other valued perennials where it can be allowed to naturalize into colonies.  May be grown in cottage gardens, wild gardens, remote parts of borders, bogs, pond peripheries or along streams.

At best, Magnolia grandiflora is considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 6b and is not reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area. If grown in St. Louis, it should be sited in a protected location. Plants may become somewhat deciduous in hard winters. It is best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Part shade may be best. It is generally intolerant of soil extremes (dry or wet). It is also intolerant of many urban pollutants. Trees will become quite large over time and should be planted in areas where they can expand.See M. grandiflora ‘Bracken’s Brown Beauty’ for a cultivar that is reliably winter hardy to USDA Zones 5b and is generally considered to be a much better selection for St. Louis landscapes than the straight species.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Magnolia grandiflora is a broadleaf evergreen tree that is noted for its attractive dark green leaves and its large, extremely fragrant flowers. It typically grows to 60-80’ tall with a pyramidal to rounded crown. This is a magnificent tree of the South. It is native to moist wooded areas in the southeastern United States from North Carolina to Florida and Texas. Leathery evergreen ovate to elliptic leaves (to 10” long) are glossy dark green above and variable pale green to gray-brown beneath. Fragrant white flowers (to 8-12” diameter) usually have six petals. Flowers bloom in late spring, with sparse continued flowering throughout the summer. Flowers give way to spherical cone-like fruiting clusters (to 3-5” long) that mature in late summer to early fall, releasing individual rose-red coated seeds suspended on slender threads at maturity.Genus name honors Pierre Magnol, French botanist (1638-1715).Specific epithet is from Latin meaning large flowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Magnolia virginiana, commonly called sweet bay magnolia, is native to the southeastern United States north along the Atlantic coast to New York. In the northern part of its cultivated growing range, it typically grows as either a 15-20' tall tree with a spreading, rounded crown or as a shorter, suckering, open, multi-stemmed shrub. In the deep South, it is apt to be more tree-like, sometimes growing to 60' tall. Features cup-shaped, sweetly fragrant (lemony), 9-12 petaled, creamy white, waxy flowers (2-3"" diameter) which appear in mid-spring and sometimes continue sporadically throughout the summer. Oblong-lanceolate shiny green foliage is silvery beneath. Foliage is evergreen to semi-evergreen in the South, but generally deciduous in the St. Louis area. Cone-like fruits with bright red seeds mature in fall and can be showy. See also Magnolia virginiana var. australis which primarily differs from the species by being somewhat taller, having more fragrant flowers and being more likely to be evergreen.Genus name honors Pierre Magnol, French botanist (1638-1715).Specific epithet means of Virginia.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 (perhaps Zone 6 where planted in protected locations) where it is easily grown in moist, well-drained soils in part shade (morning sun or sun dappled shade) to full shade.  Also tolerates full sun (albeit often with some bleaching of foliage colors), but only in the cooler northern parts of its growing range.  Established plants tolerate some soil dryness and drought.  Site in locations protected from exposure to strong winds.  Plants will spread by suckering.  Unless naturalization is desired, suckers should be promptly removed as they appear.  Single specimen shrubs may fruit poorly.  Grow more than one shrub together for best fruit production.  Easily propagated from cuttings or seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Mahonia bealei, commonly known as Beale’s barberry or leatherleaf mahonia, is an evergreen shrub with pinnate compound leaves which typically grows in a multi-stemmed clump to 4-10’ tall but occasionally taller.  It is native to western China.  It is very similar to M. japonica (native to Taiwan).  It has been introduced into the southeastern U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized from Maryland and Virginia south to Alabama and Florida.  Leathery, pinnate-compound, holly-like leaves (to 12-18"" long) grow in horizontal tiers.  Each leaf has 5-8 pairs of narrow, stiff, spiny-toothed, oblong to lance-shaped, dark green leaflets (to 4"" long) with a broad terminal leaflet extending to as much as 8” long.  Fragrant yellow flowers in loose, spreading to pendant racemes (each to 3-6” long), bloom in late winter to early spring (February- April).  Flowers are followed by ornamentally attractive, waxy green fruits which hang in grape-like clusters and mature to blue-black in late spring to early summer.  Fruits are attractive to birds. Synonymous with Berberis bealei.Genus name honors Bernard M'Mahon (1775-1816), American horticulturist and author of The American Gardener's Calendar (1806).Specific epithet probably honors a person named Beale who lived in China in the early to mid-1800s, but it is unclear today as to which Beale deserves the honor.  Thomas Chaye Beale, Scottish merchant who became Portuguese Consul to Shanghai in 1851, is a likely candidate according to many historians.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12.  Acceptable growth requires rich soils in hot and humid tropical climates, abundant water (over 150"" per year), and air temperatures that do not fall below 40 degrees F. nor rise above 100 degrees F. Propagation is from fresh seed, but it takes 8-12 years before fruit first appears.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Garcinia mangostana, commonly called mangosteen, is an erect, slow-growing, tropical tree with a pyramidal crown that is native to rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia.  It produces tangerine-sized fruits called mangosteens which are considered in many circles to be the finest tasting fruits in the world.  Unfortunately this tree is very difficult to grow outside of its native habitat because of its specific and uncompromising cultural requirements.  At this time, mangosteens are primarily cultivated in Malaysia, Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines.  Attempts to grow mangosteens in Florida, California and Hawaii have been largely unsuccessful.  In its native habitat, this tree will grow to 80' tall, but in most other tropical locations it typically matures to 40-50' tall.  Large, glossy, leathery, elliptic leaves (to 20"" long) are evergreen.  Trees are dioecious (separate male and female trees), but female flowers will produce seedless fruit without pollinization.  Four-petaled female flowers  are yellow-red with a cluster of center stamens which produce no pollen.  Hermaphroditic flowers are yellow-green with red petal  margins.  Fruits (to 4"" diameter) have thick inedible rinds that mature to reddish purple.  Within each rind are 5-8 fleshy, creamy-white, usually one-seeded segments (arils) which are the edible part of the fruit.  Fruit is juicy, sweet and mildly tart.  Time of fruiting seasons will vary depending upon geographical location and growing conditions.  

National fruit of Thailand.Genus name honors Laurent Garcin (1683-1751), French botanist, who travelled widely in India.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12 where it may be grown outdoors in sheltered locations in moist, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Prefers temperatures that do not dip below 60 degrees F.   Zero tolerance for frost.  In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant.  It performs well in a soil-based potting mix and with bright indoor light but no strong direct sun.  Too much sun will bleach out the attractive leaf colors.  Keep soils consistently moist and fertilize monthly during the growing season, but reduce soil moisture and substantially reduce fertilizer applications from autumn to late winter.  Consider placing this plant in a humidified room and/or in standing pot in a tray of wet pebbles to increase humidity.  Propagate by cuttings or division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Maranta leuconeura, commonly called prayer plant, is an evergreen, rhizomatous, low-growing, clump-forming, tropical perennial that is noted for its beautiful foliage.  It typically grows to 12-15” tall and as wide, featuring broad-elliptic to oval, predominately green leaves (to 5” long) with striking patterns, lines, blotches and shading.  White veins radiate from the midrib to the margins.  Leaf undersides are grayish-green to purplish-green.  It is native to Brazil.  Leaves close upward at night in a manner resembling praying hands, hence the common name of prayer plant.  White, two-lipped flowers with purple spots typically bloom on slender spikes in late spring to early summer, but infrequently appear on houseplants.  Small flowers are somewhat attractive but ornamentally insignificant.

Varieties and cultivars of this species are distinguished from the species by leaf patterns and leaf coloration.Genus name honors Bartolomeo Maranti (1500-1571), Venetian physician and botanist.Specific epithet from Greek leuko meaning white and neura meaning string in reference to its white leaf veins.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Performs well in light sandy soils.  Tolerates light shade.  Tolerates poor soils.  Best with regular moisture.  Plant seed directly in the garden shortly before last spring frost date (flowers will appear in mid- summer with continued flowering to frost).  For earlier flowers, start seed indoors in small pots about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date for planting outside at last frost date.   Plants will typically remain in the garden from year to year by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Matricaria recutita, commonly called German chamomile or sweet false chamomile, is an annual aromatic Eurasian herb that is commonly grown in herb gardens for harvest of its flowers which are principally used to make chamomile tea which is a mild sedative herbal drink recommended for a large number of applications including calming nerves, relaxing tense muscles, alleviating stress, dispelling insomnia and treating indigestion.  This plant has escaped garden plantings and has naturalized in open areas and along roads in various parts of North America.  It typically grows to 12-24"" tall and to 12"" wide on stems clad with aromatic but bitter tasting double pinnate leaves (to 3"" long).   Showy daisy-like flowers bloom summer to fall.  Each flower features 10-20 petal-like white rays surrounding a showy bright yellow domed center disk of tubular yellow florets.  For herbal use, harvest flowers when fully open.  Flowers may be used fresh off the plant or dried and stored in airtight containers (freeze if product will not be used soon).  German chamomile is used in most commercially marketed packages of chamomile tea rather than Roman chamomile (Chamamaemelum nobile) in large part because the former has a much sweeter and less bitter taste than the latter.Genus name comes from the medieval name possibly from the Latin word matrix meaning womb because of its one-time medical use.Specific epithet means circumcised for the ray petals.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade.   Best in rich soils with constant moisture.  Soil must never be allowed to dry out.  Spreads by underground  rhizomes to form dense colonies in optimum growing conditions.  Prefers cool summer climates and is generally intolerant of the hot and humid summers of the deep South.  Avoid windy sites.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Matteuccia struthiopteris, commonly called ostrich fern, is a clump-forming, upright to arching, rhizomatous, deciduous fern which typically grows 2-3' tall in cultivation, but may reach 6' tall in moist, cool climates in the wild. The showy parts of this fern are the finely dissected, medium green, vegetative (sterile) fronds which, as the common name suggests, exhibit the feathery appearance of long ostrich plumes. The vegetative fronds emerge at the narrow base of the clumps in spring as the familiar ""fiddleheads"" from where they unfurl to a maximum length of 4'. These vegetative fronds usually depreciate as the summer proceeds, begin to look rather tattered by early fall and finally lose their leaflets later in the fall as the plant goes dormant for the winter. The sterile fronds form a huge vase-like crown around the much less showy fertile fronds which are erect, spike-like and dark brown.  The fertile fronds arise in mid-summer and persist through the winter.Genus name honors Carlo Matteucci (1800-1863), Italian physicist.
","
Problems

Garden Uses
Mass in moist, shady woodland areas, wild gardens or wet areas near streams or ponds. Combines well with astilbes or hostas. Plant in conjunction with early spring wildflowers (e.g., trilliums, bloodroot, trout lilies or Dutchman's breeches) which will be well on the way toward dormancy by the time this fern reaches full size.

Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 6, but may be grown as annuals north of Zone 6 with plants continuing to appear in the garden for several years by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Mentha requienii, commonly called Corsican mint or creeping mint, is a miniature mat-forming plant that typically grows to only 1/2"" to 1"" tall but spreads by thread-like stems which creep along the ground rooting as they go to 12"" wide or more to form a dense flat diminutive ground cover.  It is particularly effective as an aromatic filler growing around stepping stones where light foot traffic will release a pleasing mint/sage aroma.  Leaves are evergreen in mild winter climates but not in St. Louis.  This mint is native to the Islands of Corsica, Sardinia and  Montecristo.   Tiny round green leaves (to 1/8"" across) have a strong aroma when bruised.  Leaves are the source of the flavoring in creme-de-menthe.  Tiny minute lilac flowers bloom from the leaf axils in summer (late June -August).  Flowers are so small they are often not seen.Genus name comes from Minthe or Menthe, a water nymph in Greek mythology, who was transformed by Persephone into a mint plant in revenge for Minthe's ongoing affair with Hades (husband of Persephone).Specific epithet honors Esprit Requien (1788-1851), naturalist and student of the flora of southern France and Corsica.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Metasequoia glyptostroboides, commonly called dawn redwood, is a deciduous, coniferous tree that grows in a conical shape to 100’ tall. It is related to and closely resembles bald cypress (Taxodium) and redwood (Sequoia). From fossil records, dawn redwood is known to have existed as many as 50,000,000 years ago. However, it was not until 1941 that it was first discovered growing in the wild near the town of Modaoqi, China by Chinese forester, T. Kan. Seeds collected from the original site were made available to the Missouri Botanical Garden in 1947. Seedlings grown therefrom were planted in front of the Lehmann Building at MBG in 1952 where they have now developed into large mature trees (70’+ tall). As the tree matures, the trunk broadens at the base and develops attractive and sometimes elaborate fluting. Bark on mature trees is often deeply fissured. It features linear, feathery, fern-like foliage that is soft to the touch. Foliage emerges light green in spring, matures to deep green in summer and turns red-bronze in fall. Trees are monoecious, producing oval, light brown female cones (3/4” long) and pendant globose male cones (1/2” long). The twigs, needles and cone scales are in opposite pairs.Genus name comes from the Greek words metra meaning with, after, sharing, or changed in nature and Sequoia to which it is related and to which fossil specimens were first referred.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Glyptostrobus.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Mimulus alatus, commonly called winged monkey flower, is a rhizomatous upright perennial that typically grows to 1-3' tall on square stems clad with stalked, serrate-margined, lanceolate to ovate leaves (to 2-4"" long).  The square stems have thin wings (flanges) along the edges and each flower purportedly resembles the face of a smiling monkey, hence the common name.  It is native to stream and pond margins, wet meadows, swampy areas, ditches and moist woodlands in eastern North America from Ontario to New York and Nebraska south to Texas and Florida.  In Missouri, it is found throughout the State, except the far northwestern corner (Steyermark).  Pale blue or violet (sometimes pale pink) snapdragon-like flowers (to 1"" long) bloom singly from the leaf axils on short stalks throughout summer (late June-early September).  Each flower has a tubular calyx and a two-lipped corolla.  The upper lip has 2 folded lobes and the lower lip is 3-lobed.  This species is similar to Mimulus ringens except it has short-stalked flowers and well-stalked leaves whereas M. ringens has long-stalked flowers and sessile leaves.Genus name comes from the Latin diminutive of mimus meaning a mimic as they look like a monkey face.Specific epithet from Latin means winged in reference to the winged plant stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Most hybrids are of Monarda didyma parentage and are easily grown in average, medium to wet, moisture retentive soils in full sun to part shade. Those of Monarda fistulosa parentage are more tolerant of drier soils. Prefers rich, humusy soils in full sun, but appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. Remove spent flowers to improve plant appearance and possibly to prolong bloom. Divide clumps every 3-4 years to prevent overcrowding and to control mildly spreading tendencies (slowly spreads by rhizomes). Provide plants with good air circulation to help combat fungal leaf diseases.'Claire Grace' is reputed to tolerate both wet and dry soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Monarda is a genus of about 15 species of annuals and herbaceous perennials from prairies and woodlands in North America. They flower from mid-summer to early fall and are loved by bees, hummingbirds and other pollinators.Genus name honors Nicholas Monardes (1493-1588), physician and botanist of Seville.Some monardas are commonly called beebalm in reference to a prior use of the leaves as a balm for bee stings.'Claire Grace' was discovered in Tylertown, Mississippi by Barb and Michael Bridges of Southern Perennials and Herbs and named for their daughter. It has soft to deep lavender, 3 in. wide, tubular, pin cushion-like flowers that attract butterflies and hummingbirds. The toothed, aromatic, oblong, grayish-green leaves (to 4"") may be used in teas. It is reputed to have some resistance to powdery mildew and to be tolerant of both wet and dry soil. 'Claire Grace' grows 3 to 4 ft. tall and 2 to 3 ft. wide. It may also be sold as Monarda fistulosa 'Claire Grace'.
","
Problems
Powdery mildew can be a serious problem with some of the monardas. Susceptibility to foliar diseases in general increases if plants are grown in dry soils or are allowed to dry out. Rust is also an occasional problem.'Claire Grace' is reputed to have some resistance to powdery mildew. Wet soils could result in root rots.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Morus rubra, commonly known as red mulberry, is a medium sized, upright spreading to rounded, deciduous tree that typically grows to 35-50’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. It is native to rich woods, bottomlands and wood margins from Massachusetts, southern Ontario and Minnesota south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in woodlands, rocky places, pastures, fields and along roads throughout the state (Steyermark). It is noted for its often lobed leaves, milky sap, reddish-brown bark and edible fruits. Trees are monoecious or dioecious. Ovate to oblong-ovate, toothed, usually dark green leaves (to 5” long) have heart-shaped bases. Leaves can be quite variable, however, ranging from unlobed to deeply lobed and from rough-textured to glabrous on the upper surfaces. Lobed leaves are more frequently found on new shoots and unlobed leaves are more frequently found in tree crowns. Leaves turn yellow in fall. Unisexual greenish flowers in small catkin-like spikes appear in early spring with male and female flowers usually appearing on separate trees (dioecious). Trees with only male flowers obviously never bear fruit. Fertilized female flowers are followed by sweet blackberry-like edible fruits (to 1” long) that are reddish to dark purple in color. Fruits are sweet and juicy and may be eaten off the tree. Fruits are also used for jellies, jams and wines. Fruits are not commercially sold because they have very short “shelf lives” and pack/ship very poorly. Fruits are also very attractive to birds.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means red in reference to the fruit color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Borers may be a problem particular in the South. Whiteflies mass on some trees. Bacterial blight may kill foliage/branches. Coral spot cankers may cause twig dieback. Bacterial leaf scorch, powdery mildew, root rot and witches broom may also occur. Watch for scale, mites and mealybugs. Weedy self-seeding and messy fruit are concerns.
","
Garden Uses
Female trees are often considered undesirable in urban areas because the fruit is messy and stains pavements, automobiles and areas around the home. Stains may also be unwittingly brought indoors on the bottom of shoes. Do not plant this tree in the home landscape if you object to the mess typically caused by the fruit. Non-fruiting cultivars of the similar M. alba may be a better choice.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Murraya paniculata, commonly called orange jessamine, is a small, tropical to sub-tropical tree or shrub that may grow to as much as 20' tall, but is usually found much shorter (8-12') and can be pruned as a formal hedge to as little as 2-3' tall. It is noted for its glossy evergreen dark green leaves, strongly fragrant white flowers and red ornamental fruits. It is native from China and India to Australia. Each odd-pinnate leaf typically has 3 to 9, ovate, glossy, dark green leaflets (to 2.5"" long). Fragrant white flowers (each to 7/8"" across) in terminal or axillary cymes bloom several times throughout the year. Flowers are most fragrant at night. Flowers are followed by ovoid, red fruits (each to 1/2"" long), each with 1-2 seeds. Plants may display flowers and fruits at the same time. Flowers have the scent of orange blossoms, hence the common names of orange jessamine and mock orange that are sometimes applied. Synonymous with Murraya exotica.

Murraya paniculata is a host of the Asian citrus psyllid, which is a vector for the bacterium that causes citrus greening disease (Huanglongbing).Genus name honors Johann Andreas Murray (1740-1791), Swedish pupil of Linnaeus and professor of medicine and botany, Gottingen.Specific epithet refers to the flower inflorescence.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for mealy bugs, scale and whiteflies. Root rot may occur if soils are kept too damp. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plant bulbs about 3” deep and 3” apart in fall. Flowers emerge in early spring. Keep ground moist during the spring growing season, but reduce watering after foliage begins to die back. Plants are dormant from late spring to autumn when leaves again appear. Leaves survive the cold St. Louis winter (albeit often in an unkempt fashion) before plants burst into flower in early spring. Plants will naturalize by bulb offsets, but not aggressively.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Muscari armeniacum, commonly called grape hyacinth, is an early spring-blooming bulbous perennial that is native to southeastern Europe (including Armenia). It features conical racemes of slightly fragrant, tightly packed, deep violet blue, urn-shaped flowers atop scapes rising to 8” tall in early spring. Each bulb produces 1-3 scapes with 20-40 flowers per scape. Each flower has a thin white line around the rim. Dense inflorescence purportedly resembles an elongated, upside-down bunch of grapes, hence the common name. Scapes rise up from somewhat floppy clumps of narrow, fleshy, basal, green leaves (to 12” long) that appear in autumn and live through the cold St. Louis winter to spring when the plants flower.This genus name was formerly viewed as a subgenus of the genus Muscari which comes from the Turkish name recorded by Clusius in 1583. Possibly from the Latin word muscus in reference to flower aroma.Specific epithet refers to Armenia part of its native range.
","

Best bract/sepal color in full sun, but plants also appreciate some mid-day filtered sun in hot climates. Bring containers indoors in fall when night temperatures start dropping into the 50s. Overwinter in a greenhouse or a warm sun room. Cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Mussaenda is a rounded evergreen tropical shrub or sub-shrub that will grow to 10’ tall in tropical areas, but more likely will reach 1-3’ tall in containers in the St. Louis area. Clusters (corymbs) of small, tubular flowers with five spreading lobes bloom in summer, however it is the large and colorful, ovate, leaf-like sepals (to 3” long) that provide the real ornamental display (in somewhat the same way as with Schizophragma). Some individual flowers in each cluster will develop a single enlarged sepal. Elliptic to ovate, bright green leaves (to 6” long). Hybrids sold in commerce typically feature flowers in red and/or yellow with showy sepals of white, bright red or pink.Genus name comes from the Latinization of the Sinhalese vernacular name mussenda.‘Queen Sirikit’ is a popular hybrid (probably M. erythrophylla x M. philippica ‘Aurorae’) that features yellowish-white flowers with red centers and showy deep pink sepals.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Nepeta cataria is the true catnip that is loved by house cats. Although native to Europe and Asia, it has over time naturalized in many areas around the world, including much of southern Canada and the U.S. In Missouri, it is typically found throughout the State growing in fields, waste areas, open woodlands, railroad right-of-ways, roadsides and along streams (Steyermark). Catnip typically grows in a spreading clump to 2-3' tall. Erect, branched, square, grayish stems are clad with aromatic, opposite, coarsely-toothed, triangular to ovate, gray-green leaves (to 3"" long). Leaves (above and particularly beneath) and stems are downy which helps give the plant its gray-green appearance. Small, two-lipped, white (with pale purple spotting) flowers (1/4"" long) bloom in spike-like terminal clusters at the stem ends from late spring well into summer. As a medicinal herb, catnip leaves have been used (fresh or dried) for making an herbal tea that reportedly helps reduce anxiety, induce sleep, promote perspiration (fever/cold relief), soothe sore throats (cough suppressant) and comfort upset stomachs. As a culinary herb, fresh leaves (minty flavor) may be chopped and added to soups, stews, sauces, vegetables, or pasta. As a garden plant, catnip acts as a repellant for certain insects, including aphids and squash bugs. Nepetalactone is the active ingredient that affects most cats. To harvest catnip, cut stems to the ground and hang them upside down to cure in a warm location with good air circulation. When leaves are totally dry, crumble them into bags for storage or use immediately for a variety of purposes including herbal teas, potpourris and cat toy fill. Catnip is a vigorous and weedy mint family member that is easy-to-grow, but spreads easily and is not particularly noted for its ornamental qualities in the garden. The common name of catnip is reserved for Nepeta cataria. The similar common name of catmint is given to most other species in the genus. Catmints with showier flowers, better-behaved garden habits but less excitement for cats (leaves less enticing) include certain edgers to 12"" tall (Nepeta x faassennii and Nepeta racemosa) and certain taller plants (Nepeta subsessilis, Nepeta siberica and Nepeta grandiflora). Nepeta racemosa 'Blue Wonder' (Missouri Botanical Garden Plant of Merit) and 'Walker's Low' are popular ornamental cultivars in commerce today.Genus name comes from the Latin name for certain aromatic plants that included catmint.  It  may honor the city of Nepete (known as Nepi today) located north of Rome in Etruria which was the ancient country located between the Arno and Tiber Rivers and was recognized, prior to the rise of Rome, as the center of the Etruscan civilization.Specific epithet means pertaining to cats.

Tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual in consistently moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. Seed is perhaps best sown indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date, but may be sown directly in the garden after last frost. Set out seedlings or purchased plants after last frost date. Blooms summer to fall in cool summer climates, but often fades in the heat of a St. Louis summer. Do not site these plants near vegetable gardens with other nightshade family members (e.g., eggplant, tomato, potato, or peppers) because of susceptibility to common viruses. May self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Nicotiana alata, commonly called flowering tobacco or winged tobacco, is native from southern Brazil to northeastern Argentina. It is a somewhat spindly plant that typically grows 3-5’ tall and features nocturnally fragrant, long-tubed, yellowish-green to white flowers that open only at night. Spatulate basal leaves to 12” long are attached by distinctive winged petioles (alata means winged). Upper stem leaves are much smaller and sessile. Species plants are rarely available except from seed, having been replaced by compact cultivars (to 2’ tall) which feature mostly non-fragrant flowers that open during the day in a variety of colors including red, pink, lime-green and white. The common flowering tobacco compact hybrids (N. alata x N. forgetiana) sold in cell/six packs by nurseries are classified as N. x sanderae (e.g., see Domino, Havana, Merlin, Metro and Starship Series). N. tabacum is the species cultivated for smoking tobacco.Genus name honors Jean Nicot (1530-1600), French ambassador to Lisbon who introduced tobacco into France.Specific epithet means winged.

Culture
Sow seeds in early spring. Grows best in full sun in moderately rich and well-drained soil kept well watered. Space large-leafed cultivars (such as 'Thai Magic') 1 1/2' apart and mulch to retain moisture. Pinch out centers to encourage bushy growth. As frost approaches, root cuttings in water and pot for winter use.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ocimum basilicum, commonly called basil, is a native of Africa and Asia. Tradition has it that basil was found growing around Christ's tomb after the Resurrection, and consequently, some Greek Orthodox churches use it to prepare holy water and pots of basil are set below church altars. In India, basil was believed to be imbued with a divine essence, and oaths were sworn upon it in courts. A number of varieties exist today, ranging from a tiny-leafed Greek basil to robust 2-foot-high plants with large succulent leaves. Some varieties have deep purple leaves. While flowers are typically small and whitish, some can be pink to brilliant magenta. Leaves can be dried for later use. Basil is extremely frost sensitive.Genus name comes from the Greek name okimon for an aromatic herb, possibly this one.Specific epithet means princely or royal.
","
Problems
Basil may be skeletonized by Japanese beetles. To control, remove beetles by hand.
","
Garden Uses
As a seasoning herb in many vegetable and meat dishes, or as a key ingredient of pesto and other condiments.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Needs consistent moisture. Although native to swampy and marshy areas, it grows quite well in average garden soil as long as soil is not allowed to dry out. Usually grows taller in wet soils which it tolerates well. Spreads by both creeping rhizomes and spores, and can be somewhat aggressive in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Onoclea sensibilis, commonly called sensitive fern, is a large, somewhat coarse, Missouri native, deciduous fern which occurs statewide in wet woods and thickets and in moist soils along streams and springs. Grows up to 4' tall. Features long-stalked, deeply pinnatifid, bright green, vegetative (sterile) fronds (2-4' long) with leathery, triangular leaflets (pinnae) which have distinctively netted veins. Shorter, erect, woody-like fertile fronds (to 12"" tall), whose ultimate divisions are bead-like segments, typically brown up in late summer and persist throughout the remaining season and winter. Commonly called sensitive fern because the green vegetative fronds are sensitive to and suffer almost immediate damage from the first fall frost. Also sensitive to drought.Genus name comes from the Greek words onos meaning a vessel and kleio meaning to close in reference to the closely rolled fertile fronds.Specific epithet means sensitive. In this case, the fronds are very sensitive to drought and the first fall frost.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage may depreciate as summer progresses in hot climates, particularly if soils are not kept moist.
","
Garden Uses
Best in wet woodland gardens and moist locations along streams and ponds. Also appropriate for shaded areas of a native plant garden or naturalized planting.

It is not reliably winter hardy in the northern parts of USDA Zone 6 where it should be sited in a protected location.  Although rhizomatous, it spreads slowly.  Plant foliage is evergreen in warm winter climates, but may depreciate considerably in harsh St. Louis winters.  Turf-like clumps develop over time into a 12” tall ground cover which will spread somewhat indefinitely to 12” wide or more.   Propagate by division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ophiopogon japonicus, commonly called mondo grass, is an evergreen, tuberous-rooted, rhizomatous, perennial of the lily family.  It typically forms an arching clump to 8-12” tall and as wide of narrow, linear, grass-like, dark green leaves (each leaf to 8-15” long and 3/16” wide).  It is native to woodland areas in Japan and Korea.  Foliage is similar to that of Liriope (also in the lily family), but leaves are narrower and more refined.  Small, 6-tepaled, bell-shaped, white to lilac-tinted flowers (1/4” wide) bloom in summer in short racemes (2-3” long) atop leafless stalks.  Flowers are followed by spherical, pea-sized, blue-black berries (1/4” across).  Flowers and fruits are usually partially hidden by the foliage.  This plant is ornamentally grown for its tufts of grass-like leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek ophis meaning snake and pogon meaning beard.Specific epithet means of Japan in reference to native habitat.Gyoku-ryu’ is a dwarf mondo grass cultivar that forms a dense carpet to only 1-2” tall. Tiny, pale lavender flowers bloom on short stalks in summer, but are often hidden from view by the leaves.

Start seed indoors about 6 to 8 weeks prior to last spring frost date or sow seed outdoors about two weeks prior to last spring frost date. New plants may also be purchased in cell packs at local nurseries. Cut back stems before flowers appear to encourage bushy growth. Leaf flavor is usually best before flowers bloom. Container plants may be brought indoors in fall before frost, but they usually do not overwinter well.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Origanum majorana, commonly called sweet marjorum, is a bushy sub-shrub with aromatic foliage that typically grows in an upright mound to 1-2' tall. It is widely cultivated as an annual culinary herb. Leaves are milder with a more delicate flavor than those of perennial oregano (Origanum vulgare). Sweet marjorum features branching, reddish, square stems that are densely clad with ovate, highly aromatic, pubescent, gray-green leaves (to 1.25"" long). Tiny, two-lipped, tubular, white or pale pink flowers with gray-green bracts bloom in spike-like clusters from mid to late summer. Flowers are not particularly showy. Marjorum is a popular herb (fresh or dried) for seasoning soups, sauces, salads, stuffings, stews, roasts, vegetables and meats. Fresh leaves do not freeze as well as oregano leaves. Dried leaves are sometimes added to potpourris.Genus name probably comes from the Greek words oros meaning mountain and gamos meaning beauty in reference to the physical appearance of this plant which is sometimes native of mountain areas where it is appropriately referred to as “beauty of the mountain”.

Culture
Easily grown in rich, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Add compost as needed before planting. Each plant will flower for approximately 7-10 days. Plant other cultivars with staggered bloom times to extend the total peony bloom period to approximately 6 weeks during May and June (St. Louis area). Remove spent flowers after bloom. Cut foliage to the ground and remove from the garden in fall after frost. Plants are long-lived, do not need to be divided and can be left undisturbed for years.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Paeonia is a genus of about 30 species of herbaceous and subshrubs from Europe to Asia and in Western North America. Hebaceous types die to the ground each year where the subshrub (tree peonies) have woody stems.Genus name comes from the Greek name for Paeon, physician of the gods and reputed discoverer of the medicinal properties of plants in this genus.‘America’ is an herbaceous (soft-stemmed) peony with single red flowers. It is a shrubby plant that, each year, will typically grow 30-36” tall by mid-spring, bloom, display attractive foliage throughout the summer and early fall, and then die to the ground after frost. Features large, single, cup-shaped, brilliant red blooms with golden yellow centers. Flowers appear in early to mid-season (usually May in St. Louis). Flowers have only a very mild fragrance. Green foliage is divided into oval to lance-shaped segments. Excellent cut flower. Randolph-Klehm, 1976. American Peony Society Gold Medal winner (1992).
","
Problems
Peonies are considered to be relatively pest free. Botyrtis blight and Phytopthora blight are sometimes problems. Ants on peony buds are common and totally harmless. If plants do not flower, possible causes include: (1) planted too deep or too shallow, (2) planted in too much shade, (3) late frost killed flower buds or (4) plant is too young or has been recently moved or disturbed.
","
Garden Uses
Peonies are a standard of the perennial border, both as specimens and in groups. Also effective as accents or herbaceous hedges along fences, sidewalks, driveways or walls. Flowers are extremely showy, and foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season either alone or as a frame or backdrop for other perennials.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Panicum is a genus of about 470 species of annual and perennial grasses that may be either deciduous or evergreen. They are found in tropical areas worldwide, in Europe and in temperate North America. Some are grown for their edible seeds or fodder for livestock but others are grown for their attractive foleage.Genus name comes from an old Latin word for millet.‘Huron Solstice’ is a switch grass cultivar. It is perhaps most noted for its blue-green foliage that darkens to wine-purple in summer. This is a warm season grass that typically grows in a dense, narrow, erect clump to 4’ tall. Stems retain good upright form throughout the growing season. The foliage clump is topped in early September by large, finely-textured, purple flower panicles that eventually fade to beige in fall. Seed plumes often persist throughout winter, providing visual interest as well as food for birds. U.S. Plant Patent Applied For (PPAF).

This is an easy-to-grow plant with good tolerance for a wide range of soils and urban conditions.  It often needs little care, but must be trimmed regularly to keep it in bounds.  It should be sited in areas where it will have room to expand and grow.  It should not be grown up wood or shingle walls because the holdfasts are difficult to remove.  It can ruin painted surfaces.  If unchecked, vines can also attach to and seriously damage such objects as gutters, shutters or wiring around homes and buildings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Parthenocissus quinquefolia is a deciduous, woody vine that is commonly called Virginia creeper or woodbine.  It is native to eastern and central North America south to Mexico.  It occurs statewide in Missouri, typically being located in open areas of ravines, valleys, rich woods, thickets, rocky bluffs, hillsides and fencerows (Steyermark).  This is a vigorous tendril-climbing vine that will rapidly grow to 30-50’ long or more.  It needs no support because it clings to surfaces (e.g., brick, stone or wood walls) by adhesive holdfasts (also called sucker disks) located at the tendril ends. It also will creep along the ground as suggested by the common name.  Compound-palmate leaves (usually 5 saw-toothed leaflets, each leaflet to 6” long) emerge purplish in spring, mature to dull green in summer and change to attractive shades of purple and crimson red in fall.  Greenish white flowers in late spring to early summer appear in the upper leaf axils, but are generally hidden by the foliage and are ornamentally insignificant.  Flowers give way to blue-black berries (to 3/8” diameter) which are also hidden by the foliage and are often not visible until autumn leaf drop.  Birds eat the berries.Genus name comes from the Greek words parthenos meaning a virgin and kissos meaning ivy.Specific epithet means five-leaved in reference to the palmate leaves.  
.
","
Problems
No serious problems. Mildews, leaf spots, canker and wilt are occasional problems. Also susceptible to a number of insect pests including beetles, scale and leaf hoppers. Once attached to the side of a building or home, it becomes difficult to remove and will damage painted surfaces and leave residues.
","
Garden Uses
Effective as a climber for brick or stone walls of buildings, large trellises, arbors, fences or through large trees.  Also effective as a ground cover to cover rock piles, stumps or for erosion control on slopes.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Parthenocissus tricuspidata, commonly called Boston ivy, is a rapid-growing, deciduous, woody vine that typically grows 30-50’ long or more. It is a vigorous tendril climber that needs no support. It clings to surfaces (e.g., brick, stone or wood walls) by adhesive holdfasts (also called sucker disks) located at the tendril ends. Although native to China and Japan, this ivy has been widely planted in the U.S., and is the ivy that covers the walls of many college/university buildings, giving rise in the Northeast to the name Ivy League. Species plants have dark green leaves (to 4-8” wide) in variable shapes but usually three lobed (sometimes in three leaflets). Greenish white flowers in late spring to early summer appear in the upper leaf axils, but are generally hidden by the foliage and are ornamentally insignificant. Flowers give way to blue-black berries (to 1/3” diameter) which are also hidden by the foliage and often not visible until autumn leaf drop. Birds eat the berries. Foliage turns scarlet red to scarlet purple in fall. Foliage is semi-evergreen in warm climates. 

Synonymous with and formerly known as Ampelopsis tricuspidata.Genus name comes from the Greek words parthenos meaning a virgin and kissos meaning ivy.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words tri meaning three and cuspidatus meaning with a sharp point in reference to each plant leaf having three sharply-pointed lobes.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. In St. Louis, passion flower should be grown in a container that is overwintered indoors in the cool temperatures of a greenhouse or in the bright light of a home with temperature around 60 F. For containers, use a well-drained, peat/humusy potting mix. Place containers outdoors in full sun after last spring frost date. Best flowering in full sun, but tolerates light shade. This flowering vine appreciates high humidity, but needs good air circulation to discourage fungal diseases. Water evenly and consistently during the growing season. Vines produce flowers on new growth, so they may be pruned as needed early in the growing season. Bring vines indoors before first fall frost date. Reduce watering from fall to late winter. Passion flower may be grown as a houseplant in a sun room or in a sunny south-facing window.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Passiflora coccinea, commonly called red passion flower or red granadilla, is a tropical, tendril-climbing, evergreen vine from South America that typically grows to 10-12’ and to 3-5’ wide and produces extremely showy scarlet red to deep red passion flowers (each to 3-4” wide). Flowers are followed by orange to yellow, edible passion fruit (to 2-3” long) known as red granadilla. Smooth, red to purple stems are clad with single, doubly serrate, oblong, medium green leaves (to 5” long). Hummingbirds and butterflies are attracted to the flowers. Passion flowers have an acquired religious significance that dates back to the 1700s when early Spanish settlers interpreted various parts of the flower to be symbolic of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, hence the common name.Genus name comes from the Latin words passio meaning passion and flos meaning a flower for the flower's symbolism of the crucifixion of Christ.Specific epithet means scarlet.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Caterpillars (butterfly larvae) chew unsightly holes in the leaves.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Pennisetum orientale is a warm season fountain grass that is native to Asia. It is an ornamental grass that typically forms graceful, spreading foliage clumps to 18” tall and as wide of narrow, gray-green leaves (to 1/4” wide). Showy, fluffy, pinkish-white flower spikes arch upward and outward from the foliage clump in late summer like water spraying from a fountain, hence the common name. Flower spikes rise well above the foliage to 2.5-3’ tall. Flower spikes persist over a very long bloom period from early June to August before eventually disintegrating. Foliage changes to yellowish-tan in fall, and usually remain attractive throughout the winter.Genus name comes from the Latin penna meaning feather and seta meaning bristle in reference to the flowers having long, feathery bristles.Specific epithet means of the Orient.‘Karley Rose’ is distinguished from the species by having (1) deeper green foliage, (2) darker, smoky rose-purple flower spikes that are larger and fuller, (3) longer bloom period extending into September and (4) better winter hardiness.

Although perennial, this plant is often grown from seed as an annual for culinary and/or ornamental use.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cryptotaenia japonica, commonly called Japanese parsley, Japanese honeywort or mitsuba, is an herbaceous perennial with foliage that somewhat resembles a flat-leaved parsley.  It is native to moist woodland areas and ditches in eastern Asia.   Branching stems of ternate compound leaves (mitsuba means three leaves in Japanese) with serrated ovate segments (each to 2-4"" long) typically grow in an upright clump to 12-18"" tall and as wide.  Small white flowers in umbels bloom in summer on stems rising about 6"" above the foliage.  Seeds ripen in August-September.  Plants are frequently used as culinary herbs in Asian cuisine.  Leaves and stems are considered to have a parsley/celery-like flavor and may be added to soups, salads or other hot/cold dishes as a flavoring and/or garnish.  Roots can be blanched and sauteed.  

Forma atropurpurea plants have ruffled purple-black foliage and stems which contribute significant ornamental interest to garden areas.  Umbels of light pink to purple flowers bloom above the foliage in midsummer bringing plant height to 24"" tall.  Leaves typically lose sharp color intensity as the summer progresses.  Culinary uses are the same as for species plants.  Very closely related to Cryptotaenia japonica is the North American species Cryptotaenia canadensis, which is native from Quebec to Manitoba south to Georgia and Texas.  In Missouri, it is found in rocky woods, ravines, valleys and along streams and bluff ledges throughout the State (Steyermark).Genus name comes from the Greek word cryptos meaning hidden and tainia meaning band, ribbon or fillet in probable reference to oil tubes hidden or concealed in the fruits.Specific epithet means of Japan.

Grow in fertile, moderately dry to moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in full sun.  More tolerant of drier soils than most other species of phlox.  Appreciates a summer mulch which helps keep the root zone cool.  Spreads by rhizomes to form clumps.  Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Phlox pilosa, commonly known as prairie phlox or downy phlox, is native from Connecticut to Ontario and Manitoba south to Louisiana and Florida.  In Missouri, it is typically found in rocky or dry open woods, valleys, thickets, meadows, prairies and glades (Steyermark) throughout most of the State.  This is an upright perennial that grows in a clump to 12-16"" (less frequently to 24"") tall on stiff stems clad with opposite, widely-spaced, sharp pointed, linear to linear-lanceolate, stalkless, deep green leaves (each to 4"" long and 3/4"" wide) with prominent central veins.  Leaves are often finely pubescent.  Fragrant, tubular, pink to pale purple flowers (to 3/4” diameter) are loosely packed in rounded terminal clusters (cymes).  Flowers bloom from May to July with a possible sparse rebloom in fall.  Each individual flower has a long corolla tube and five flat petal-like lobes which lack notches.  Stems, leaves and corolla tubes are often covered with soft white hairs, hence the specific epithet of pilosa means soft hairy and the sometimes used common name of downy phlox.  Butterflies love the flowers.  USDA currently lists nine different subspecies for this plant (deamii, detonsa, fulgida, latisepala, ozarkana, pilosa, pulcherima, riparia and sangamonensis).The genus name is derived from the Greek word phlox meaning flame in reference to the intense flower colors of some varieties.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Prairie phlox has good resistance to powdery mildew.  Watch for spider mites in hot, dry conditions.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Physalis alkekengi, commonly called Chinese lantern, is an herbaceous perennial of the nightshade family that grows in an upright clump to 24” tall and as wide. Stems are clad with ovate-rhombic medium green leaves (to 3” long) with entire to undulate margins. Small, bell-shaped, axillary, white flowers in summer are insignificant. The showy part of this plant is the papery, globose, orange-red calyx (to 2” long), resembling the shape of a Chinese lantern, that forms around each ripening fruit in late summer. The bright calyces provide excellent and somewhat unique fall color. Fruit is technically edible but tasteless and rarely eaten. Fruiting stems are used in both fresh arrangements and dried arrangements. For dried arrangements, cut stems as soon as the calyces turn from green to orange-red, remove the leaves and then hang the stems upright in a dry location.Genus name comes from the Greek physa meaning a bladder for the inflated calyx.Specific epithet comes from Arabic meaning bladder cherry in reference to the husked fruit.

This member of the Solanaceae family can generally be treated like its relative, the tomato. Sow seeds in peat pots 4 to 6 weeks before date of last frost or sow directly in ground after all danger of frost is past and night temperatures are 55 degrees F or above. Plants are quite robust, 3 or 4' across and almost as high, so allow plenty of room. Tomato cages can reduce the sprawl somewhat. Plant in fertile, well-drained soil, in full sun. Water regularly, fertilize, and keep well mulched for best results.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Physalis ixocarpa, commonly called tomatillos, are a necessary ingredient of most Mexican salsas. Fruits are borne inside a paper “husk” (the calyx) and are also known as husk tomatoes. When fully ripe, the yellow to purple sweet fruits will swell and split the husks. However, most culinary uses, such as Mexican salsa verde, call for harvesting when the fruit is still green and tart. Tomatillos are easy to grow and very productive. The fruits will keep through the winter if stored loose in a cool place.Genus name comes from the Greek physa meaning a bladder for the inflated calyx.Specific epithet means with sticky or glutinous fruit.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Physocarpus opulifolius, commonly called ninebark, is an upright, spreading, somewhat coarse, deciduous, Missouri-native shrub which is closely related to genus Spiraea.  In Missouri, it typically occurs along streams, rocky banks, gravel bars and in moist thickets, especially in counties south of the Missouri River (Steyermark).  Grows 5-9’ tall (less frequently to 10’).  Noted for its exfoliating bark (on mature branches) which peels in strips to reveal several layers of reddish to light brown inner bark (hence the common name of ninebark).  Bark provides winter interest, but is usually hidden by the foliage during the growing season.  Features small pink or white, five-petaled flowers appearing in dense, flat, rounded, 1-2” diameter, spirea-like clusters (corymbs) in late spring.  Flowers give way to drooping clusters of reddish fruit (inflated seed capsules).  Ovate to rounded, usually 3-5 lobed leaves (to 4” long) are dull green in summer changing to an undistinguished yellow in fall.Genus name comes from the Greek physa meaning a bladder and karpos meaning fruit, referring to the inflated dry fruits of the plant.Specific epithet refers to the leaves that resemble those of Viburnum opulus.Common name of ninebark is in reference to its ornamental attractive exfoliating bark.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Physostegia angustifolia is an upright, clump-forming mint family (square stems) member that typically grows 2-4' tall and features long-lasting, late summer terminal spikes of pinkish, snapdragon-like flowers. Genus members are commonly called obedient plants because each individual flower will temporarily remain in a new position if pushed in any direction as if it were hinged. This species is native to the Ozark and unglaciated prairie areas of central and southern Missouri. Steyermark suggests that this species is very similar to the more commonly found and commercially sold P. virginiana, except this species tends to have more rigid stems and narrower leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek words physa meaning bladder and stege meaning covering in reference to the calyces which inflate as they develop.Specific epithet means narrow-leaved.

This is a narrow, pyramidal, spire-like tree with pendant branches that ascend at the tips.  Flattened bright green needles have silvery undersides.   Brown bark cracks into scaly plates.  Pubescent new shoots.  Pendant cones (to 2 1/2"" long) emerge violet purple but mature to yellowish brown.Genus name is reportedly derived from the Latin word pix meaning pitch in reference to the sticky resin typically found in spruce bark.Specific epithet is the Serbian name for spruce.

Summer foliage decline and reduced vigor results in weakened plants that may succumb to a harsh winter. It grows best in locations sheltered from wind with some afternoon shade. Remove spent flowers immediately after bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pieris japonica is a broadleaf evergreen shrub that typically matures to 9-12’ tall with a dense, upright habit. It features drooping clusters (racemes to 6” long) of lily-of-the-valley-like white flowers in early spring. Serrulate, oblanceolate to obovate-oblong leaves (to 3.5” long) emerge orange-bronze but mature to glossy dark green. Leaves are evergreen. Bead-like flower buds are set in late summer for the following year and provide winter interest and contrast to the evergreen foliage. Many cultivars are available featuring flowers in various shades of white, pink and deep rose. 

Synonymous with and sometimes sold as Andromeda japonica.Genus name is the name of one of the Greek Muses.Specific epithet means of Japan.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pinus strobus, commonly called Eastern white pine, is a rapid-growing, long-lived, needled evergreen tree that is native to the northeastern United States and Canada (State tree of Maine and Michigan). Although pyramidal in its early years, it matures to a broad oval habit with an irregular crown. Typically grows 50-80' in cultivation, but will grow to 100' tall in the wild, with records existing to over 200'. Landscape size and shape can be controlled through pruning, however, to the extent that white pine may be sheared and grown as a hedge. Bluish green needles (to 5"" long) are soft to the touch and appear in bundles of five. Cylindrical, brown cones ( 4-8"" long) are usually not produced until 5-10 years. An important timber tree (perhaps more so in the 18th and 19th centuries than now) which was and is valued for its lightweight, straight-grained wood (orange heartwood and white sapwood).Genus name comes from the Latin name for pines.Specific epithet in Greek means cone but here it may refer to an incense-bearing or gum-yielding tree.
","
Problems
In cool summer locations, white pine can grow quite well. It is, however, susceptible to a large number of insect and disease problems. Blights and rusts are the main diseases, with its most dangerous enemy being white pine blister rust which is a bark disease that is usually fatal. Species of Ribes (e.g., currants and gooseberries) are the alternate host for white pine blister rust and should not be planted in areas where white pines are under attack. White pine blister rust is not currently a problem in Missouri. Additional disease problems of significance include canker. Insect problems include white pine weevil, bark beetles, white pine shoot borer, Zimmerman moth larvae, pine sawfly, scale and aphids. Spider mites are occasional visitors in some areas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Pinus sylvestris, commonly called Scots pine, is a fast-growing, conical to columnar, medium sized conifer with distinctive flaking orange/red-brown bark. It typically grows 30-60’ tall in cultivation, but may reach 100’ in the wild. It develops an open-rounded, irregular crown as it matures. It is a very widely distributed pine that is native to northern Europe and northern Asia, but has also naturalized in parts of the northeastern and north-central U.S. It is the only pine that is native to Great Britain. Plants will vary in habit, hardiness and needle appearance depending on their specific native geographical growing region. Scots pine generally features (1) twisted, blue-green needles (to 3” long) in bundles of two, (2) gray to light brown cones (to 3” long) and (3) scaly orange/red bark in upper part but darker red-brown near the base. The common name of scotch pine is still popular, but is now considered by some experts to be inappropriate.Genus name comes from the Latin name for pines.Specific epithet means of woods and forests.
","
Problems
Scots pine and its cultivars may be grown in the St. Louis area, but they will often struggle because of soil, climate and disease susceptibility. Sphaeropsis (Diplodia) tip blight can be a significant problem in some areas. Watch for pine wilt nematode. Sawflies, moths and scale may also appear.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Pistacia chinensis, commonly called pistachio or Chinese pistache, is native to China, Taiwan and the Philippines. It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows to 30-35’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with an oval rounded crown. Foliage consists of compound, even-pinnate, dark green leaves (to 10” long), each leaf typically having 10-12 lanceolate leaflets (to 4” long). Foliage is aromatic when bruised. Fall color is variable but often appears in quality shades of yellow, orange and red. Trees are dioecious (separate male and female trees), with flowers appearing in April in visible but somewhat inconspicuous green panicles. Pollinized flowers on female trees give rise to red-ripening-to-blue spherical fruits (drupes to 1/4” diameter) that ripen in fall. Drupes are inedible (Pistacia vera produces the edible pistachio nuts). Gray-brown bark peels to reveal salmon inner bark. Plants have naturalized in small areas of California, Texas, Alabama and Georgia.Genus name honors Dutch naturalist and physician William Piso (d. 1648).Specific epithet means of China.

Can be quite invasive in frost-free tropical climates where it is evergreen. In St. Louis, several plants should be lifted each year in fall before first frost for overwintering on moist sandy loams in containers placed in bright frost-free indoor areas of at least 50 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pistia stratiotes, commonly called water lettuce, is a free-floating, frost-tender aquatic perennial that is commonly used as an ornamental plant in water gardens. It produces rosettes (4-6” across) of wedge-shaped, overlapping, fluted, velvety, soft green leaves covered with water-repellant hairs. Plants resemble small open heads of lettuce. New plants are formed at the ends of stolons radiating outward from the mother plant. Plants can spread rapidly to form dense mats of foliage (to 4” tall), and are considered to be noxious weeds in many tropical and sub-tropical areas where they can quickly cover a pond or lake from shore to shore. Tubular, axillary, arum-like, yellowish-green to creamy white flowers are generally inconspicuous. Flowers give way to similarly inconspicuous green berry-like fruits. Feathery roots dangle downward from the plants, providing a shelter for many small fish. As an ornamental plant, water lettuce provides attractive foliage that inhibits growth of algae and helps keep water clear. Although generally believed not to be native to the U.S., water lettuce is now found from New York south to Florida and west to California. It is included on the Federal Noxious Weed List. It is also sometimes commonly called shell flower.Genus name comes from the Greek word pistos meaning water in reference to the floating habit.Specific epithet comes from Greek meaning soldier in account of the plant's sword-shaped leaves.

Culture
Best grown in light, medium moisture, organically rich, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Avoid wet or poorly-drained soils. Plants are easily grown from seed. Division and transplanting are possible but tricky because of the fragile, fleshy root systems of these plants, and it is probably best to leave plants undisturbed once established. Deadheading spent flowers generally prolongs the bloom period. New season plant stems emerge late in spring, so gardeners must be careful not to damage crowns by early cultivation (leaving old plant stems in place throughout winter to the point when the new growth first appears helps mark plant locations). Taller plants often need to be staked because of floppy stems. Consider cutting back plant stems by 1/2 in May to reduce plant height and possibly avoid staking.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Platycodon grandiflorus, commonly called balloon flower, is a clump-forming perennial that is so named because its flower buds puff up like balloons before bursting open into outward-to-upward-facing, bell-shaped flowers with five pointed lobes. Plants are native to slopes and meadows in China, Japan, Korea and Siberia. Purple-blue flowers (to 2-3” across) bloom throughout summer, singly or in small clusters, atop stems typically growing to 30” tall. Ovate to lance-shaped, toothed, blue-green leaves (to 2” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words platys meaning broad and kodon meaning a bell for the shape of the corolla.Specific epithet means large-flowered.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Somewhat wide range of soil tolerance except for wet, poorly-drained ones. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where it will benefit from a light winter mulch. Spreads by rhizomes and can be somewhat aggressive in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ceratostigma plumbaginoides, commonly called plumbago or leadwort, is a wiry, mat-forming perennial which spreads by rhizomes to form an attractive ground cover. Typically grows 6-10"" tall on generally erect stems rising from the rhizomes. Oval to obovate, shiny, medium green leaves (to 2"" long) turn bronze-red in autumn. Terminal clusters of 5-petaled, gentian blue flowers (1/2 to 3/4"" diameter) appear above the foliage over a long summer to frost bloom period. Flowers resemble those of woodland phlox.Genus name comes from the Greek words keras meaning a horn and stigma from the hornlike projection on the stigma of the flower.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Plumbago.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Will spread.
","
Garden Uses
Late, long-flowering plant serves as excellent ground cover for sunny to partly shaded areas in the landscape. A good plant for interplanting with spring bulbs because foliage emerges late as the bulb foliage is dying back. Underplanting for shrubs. Edger. May be used in rock gardens or border fronts with careful monitoring of spread. As a ground cover, plumbago would probably be as extensively planted as vinca, pachysandra or English ivy, except for the fact that it lacks their evergreen foliage.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Plumeria alba, commonly called white frangipani or nosegay, is a small rounded deciduous tree of the dogbane family that grows in a vase-shape to 15-25' tall.  It features fragrant white flowers with yellow centers.  Upright branches are thick but weak, and have a milky sap.  This species is native to Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, but has been introduced into a number of tropical areas around the world.  Very fragrant 5-petaled flowers (to 3"" wide) bloom in terminal clusters at the branch tips from spring to fall.  Flowers are white with yellow centers.  Oblong-lanceolate green leaves (to 12"" long) are spirally clustered at the stem ends.  Fruits are cylindrical pods (to 8"") that are rarely formed in cultivation.Genus name honors Charles Plumier (1646-1704), French monk of the Franciscan order, botanist and traveller.Specific epithet means white.Common name of frangipani is from the name of a 16th century Italian nobleman who created a perfume with a similar scent.   

Plumeria flowers (particularly those of Plumeria rubra) are used to make leis and a scented oil in a number of Pacific islands including Hawaii.

In the St. Louis area, it may not be grown in the ground, but it can be grown as a houseplant or container plant that may be kept outside during the frost-free growing season, but brought indoors in fall for overwintering. Container plants should be protected from full sun when taken outdoors.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Podocarpus macrophyllus, commonly called yew plum pine or Buddhist pine, is native to mountainous areas of China and Japan. It is an evergreen conifer that typically grows as a narrow-conical tree to 50’ tall or sometimes as a large shrub. In cultivation in warm winter areas of the U. S., it usually grows much shorter (to 20-40’). This is a slow-growing conifer that features leathery, soft-textured, shiny dark green, yew-like needles (to 4” long) arranged in dense spirals. Foliage is pleasantly fragrant when bruised. Ellipsoidal fruits (to 1.5” long) are fleshy, olive-green, berry-like cones that ripen in the second year to purple. Fruits may be eaten out of hand or used in pies and cakes. Other common names include Japanese yew, yew pine, southern yew, yew podocarpus and podocarpus. P. macrophyllus var. maki is a slower-growing version of the species (plants typically attain a height of no more than 6-8’ in 10 years) with shorter needles (to 3” long) and a narrow, dense, upright habit. Var. maki makes an excellent houseplant that can easily be kept in the 4-5’ tall range through regular pruning.Genus name comes from the Greek words pous or podos meaning a foot and karpos meaning a fruit as the fruit is born on a fleshy stalk.Specific epithet means large-leaved.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pontederia cordata, commonly called pickerel weed, is a vigorous, deciduous, emergent marginal aquatic perennial that typically grows 2-4’ tall. It is native to quiet waters at stream and pond margins from Nova Scotia south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it is typically found growing in sloughs, swamps and ponds scattered in a few counties in the far eastern and far western parts of the State (Steyermark). In the wild, it is frequently seen growing in dense colonies. Glossy, narrow, arrowhead-shaped green leaves (to 10” long) have rounded cordate bases and rise well above the water surface. Tiny, tubular soft blue flowers are densely packed into erect, 3-6” long spikes atop flower stalks typically rising 1-2’ above the water surface. Plants flower freely from June to October. Flowers give way to starchy seeds with distinctive toothed ridges. Flower spikes droop after bloom, releasing the distinctive seeds into the water. Seeds are edible off the plant or can be dried and added to granola cereals. Very young leaves can be used as salad greens. Dragonflies and damselflies commonly lay their eggs on plant stems near the water surface. Fish (albeit more than just pickerel) may seek shelter in clumps of these plants, hence the common name of pickerel weed.Genus name honors Guilio Pontedera (1688-1757), professor of botany at Padua.Specific epithet refers to the rounded cordate bases of the leaves.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Portulaca oleracea is commonly known as purslane or moss rose. Although purslane is grown as a vegetable (stems and leaves) in some parts of the world, many American gardeners know it best as a prostrate, summer annual lawn weed that produces small non-showy yellow flowers. It is only certain large-flowered cultivars that elevate this plant into the realm of the ornamental. Those cultivars feature 2” diameter flowers in orange, yellow, red, pink, white and bicolors. Plants typically grow 4-8” tall and spread to 15” wide. Flowers bloom summer to frost. Flowers do not open on cloudy or rainy days. Spatulate to ovate, flat, fleshy leaves (to 1.25” long). Some plants sold in commerce as cultivars of P. oleracea are actually P. umbraticola.Genus name comes from the Latin name for P. oleracea.Specific epithet means of the vegetable garden.Plants in the RIO SERIES are prostrate trailing free-flowering annuals that typically grow to 4-6"" tall but spread to 10-12"" wide on stems clad with flat, fleshy, spatulate to ovate, succulent leaves (to 1.25"" long). Flowers (to 1.5-2"" diameter) have five overlapping petals in a variety of bright colors. When grown as annuals, flowers bloom continuously from spring to first autumn frost. When grown in a greenhouse-type environment, flowers will bloom year round. Flowers usually do not open on cloudy or rainy days. RIO SERIES consists of six cultivars that originated in a controlled breeding program in Cartago, Costa Rica in January of 2002. The six cultivars have all received U.S. plant patents and are listed as follows: 
(1) 'Balriorose' (light rose flowers, medium green leaves) PP17,240 issued November 28, 2006;
(2) 'Balriorg' (orange flowers, medium green leaves) PP17,241 issued November 28, 2006;

Winter hardy to USDA Zone 4-8 where it may be grown in a variety of moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers organically rich soils.  Plantings should be kept consistently moist in summer.  For large groundcover plots, plants may be mowed after bloom on a high mower setting for purposes of not only deadheading the flowers but also helping to maintain the structural integrity and appearance of the planting.  Propagate by division, cuttings or seed.  

Cultivars often do not come true from seed, however, so deadheading spent cultivar flowers may be necessary in order to prevent unwanted self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Prunella grandiflora, commonly known as large-flowered self-heal, is a sprawling, low-growing, mat-forming, semi-evergreen perennial of the mint family that typically grows to 6-12” tall, but spreads by stolons and rhizomes to 18-36” wide.  It is native to meadows and woodlands in Europe.  Ovate to lanceolate, deep green leaves (4” long) with sparsely toothed margins grow in basal tufts.  Tubular, 2-lipped, purple flowers (to 1” long) bloom in summer in terminal flower spikes (to 2-3” long) located atop square, opposite-leaved flowering stems rising to 12” tall.  

This species has a history of use both as a medicinal herb (treatment of a large number of medical ailments including throat inflammations and quinsy) and as a culinary herb (raw, cooked or dried leaves were added to soups, salads or stews).Genus name was used by 15th and 16th century German herbalists.Specific epithet means large-flowered.Common name of self-heal is in reference to one-time medicinal uses for this plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Powdery mildew, leaf spot and blight occasionally appear.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in full sun.  Good soil drainage is essential.  Plants will perform poorly and may not survive winter in hard clay soils that retain moisture.  Plants tolerate heat and some dry soils once established.  Deadhead spent flowers to promote additional bloom.  Agastache hybrids are typically winter hardy to at least USDA Zone 6.  Where winter survival is a potential problem, plants should be sited in protected locations (e.g., southern exposures) with leaf and flower stems being left in place over winter for additional protection.  Sandy/gravelly mulches will protect plants and help to avoid onset of rot.  Hybrids grown from seed will usually not come true.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache, commonly called giant hyssop, is a genus containing about 30 species of upright herbaceous perennials, most of which are native to North America.  

Agastache hybrids often have showier flowers and better winter hardiness than species plants.  Hybrid flowers come in a variety of different flower colors including shades of red, orange, pink, yellow and white.  Hybrids typically feature dense terminal spikes of tiny 2-lipped tubular flowers which bloom mid-summer to fall in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) atop 2-4’ tall stiff square stems clad with opposite pairs of serrate, fragrant (anise/licorice scented) gray-green to medium green leaves. Flowers are attractive to bees, hummingbirds and butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.‘Apricot Sunrise’ features apricot-orange flowers over a long late June to September (sometimes to frost) bloom period.  It is an F-1 hybrid resulting from a cross between A. coccinea and A. aurantiaca (both native to the southwestern U. S.).  It typically grows to 2-3’ tall.  Leaves can be used to flavor cold drinks and teas.
","
Problems
Crown/root rot may develop in poorly drained soils.  No serious insect or disease problems, but watch for rust, powdery mildew and leaf spots. Deer tend to avoid this plant.

Culture
Prefers medium to dry, well-draining soil in full sun. Tolerant of occasional drought and poor soil. Best growth and flowering in fertile soils. Reliably winter hardy in Zones 8-11. Cultivation of this plant is dependent on the hardiness zone it is grown in. In warmer climates (Zones 10-11, possibly 9) this plant can be grown as a small, multi-trunked tree or large shrub. Vigorous pruning can keep the size and shape of this plant in check, as well as increase the number of blooms. Aloysia virgata is very sensitive to temperature, and even a mild frost can cause complete defoliation. Otherwise it is evergreen. In cooler climates (Zones 8-9, possibly 7) after a full season of growth, this plant can be cut back in a similar manner to a herbaceous perennial. Deadheading throughout the growing season will ensure continuous blooming, and pinching can keep the shape in check. In colder climates (Zones 6 or 7 and below), this plant must be grown in a container and brought indoors for the winter. After the first frost, the leaves will drop and the plant can be kept dormant in the same container in a dark, cool (60 F) area. Water sparingly. This plant can also be kept active through the winter if placed in a warm, sunny location inside before the first frost. However, white flies and spider mites can be issues when kept indoors in leaf.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aloysia virgata, commonly known as sweet almond bush is fast growing, woody shrub or small tree native to northern Argentina. In climates where it does not die back in the winter, it can grow up to 15' tall. Its habit is upright to slightly arching, with long, thin branches. Slightly glossy, dark green leaves, ovate to lanceolate in shape, are oppositely arranged along the branches. Grown for its extremely fragrant white blooms, which emerge from the ends of new growth on clusters of flowering spikes. On hot, summer evenings, the fragrance can permeate the whole garden.Genus name honors Maria Louisa (d. 1819), princess of Parma and wife of King Carlos IV of Spain.The specific epithet virgata refers to the long, thin branches of this plant.The common name refers to the fragrance of the blooms, which has a sweet odor reminiscent of almonds.
","
Problems
No serious insects or disease problems when planted outdoors. Specimens kept indoors are highly susceptible to white fly, spider mite, and aphid infestations. Over watering or poorly draining soil can cause root rot.
","
Garden Uses
Where hardy, use as a summer blooming small tree, large shrub, or large perennial. Hard pruning and deadheading is encouraged to control its shape, as the fragrant blooms only form on new growth. Use in containers, rock gardens, or sunny borders.

Culture
Best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Self pollinating. Benefits from regular watering, fertilization and pruning. Plant in full sun in a site where periodic chemical spraying will not pose any problems to adjacent sites. Avoid planting nectarine trees in the same soil where other stone fruits have recently grown. Dwarf trees may be planted as close as 10' apart.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Prunus persica, commonly called peach, is native to China. It is grown for its luscious fruit but some cultivars are grown chiefly for there flowers and produce inedible fruit. Species trees grow up to 25' tall and wide but peach trees sold in commerce today are grafted to rootstocks which control the size of the tree. Dwarf trees bear standard size fruit, but have the advantage of fitting into smaller sites and being more manageable (easier pruning, spraying and harvesting).

Var. nectarina, commonly called nectarine, is basically a smooth-skinned peach. Nectarine trees sold in commerce today are also grafted to rootstocks which controls the size of the tree.Genus name from Latin means plum or cherry tree.Specific epithet means Persia. Prunus persica reached Europe from China through Persia.'Mericrest' produces soft pink blossoms in early spring are followed by medium to large freestone nectarines with bright yellow flesh and fuzzless, yellow skin blushed with red. Fruit ripens in early to mid August (USDA Zone 5). Dwarf trees produce standard-sized fruit, but have the obvious advantages of fitting into smaller sites and being more manageable (i.e., easier pruning, spraying and harvesting). The tree growing at the Kemper Center was grafted to a dwarf rootstock which results in a very small tree typically growing to only 8-10' tall.  'Mericrest' is also available in commerce as a standard-sized tree (grafted to a standard rootstock) which typically grows 12-15' tall.
","
Problems
Nectarines are susceptible to a large number of serious pest problems. A regular regimen of chemical spraying is needed in order to insure harvesting a good crop. Potential disease problems include peach leaf curl, brown rot, bacterial leaf spot and canker. Potential insect problems include peach tree borer, plum curculio, oriental fruit moth, root nematodes, mites and aphids. Very cold winter temperatures and late spring frosts often cause significant damage to the buds/flowers of nectarines.'Mericrest' is noted for its cold hardiness.
","
Garden Uses
Nectarines are grown almost exclusively for their fruit crop. Attractive early spring bloom is a nice bonus.Dwarf trees fit into small places and are ideal for a sunny spot in the back yard.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pseudotsuga menziesii, commonly called Douglas fir, is a very large conifer that grows 50-80' tall in cultivation, but to 300+' tall in the wild. Unique forked cone bracts distinguish this tree from all other conifers. The species is indigenous to coastal areas and up to 5500' in elevation in the mountains from British Columbia south to central California. Cones (to 4.5"" long) are pendulous with protruding trident-shaped bracts. Flat, linear, spirally-arranged, dark green needles (to 1.5"" long) with white banding beneath. Fallen or plucked needles leave raised circular leaf scars on the twigs. Needles are fragrant when bruised. Narrow pyramidal shape with branching to the ground when young. Trees become more cylindrical with age as they lose their lower branching, with older trees typically having branching only on the top 1/3 of the tree. This is an important timber tree in the Pacific Northwest. Pseduotsuga menziesii var. glauca is the Rocky Mountain variety of this tree. It grows at higher elevations (to 9500') with a slower growth rate, and has shorter cones (to 3""), blue-green needles and better winter hardiness. Var. glauca is the commonly cultivated variety of this tree for areas outside of the Pacific Northwest, and is clearly a better selection for midwestern climates than the species because of its better cold tolerance (species is hardy to USDA Zone 6, but var. glauca is hardy to Zone 4). Synonymous with and sometimes called Pseudotsuga taxifolia.Genus name comes from the Greek words pseudo meaning false and Tsuga meaning hemlock.Specific epithet honors Scottish naval surgeon and botanist Archibald Menzies (1754-1842).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems when grown in the proper environment.
","
Garden Uses
This is one of the largest trees in the world... a great timber tree and a great forest tree, but not really a great landscape tree for cities or towns. Growth of this magnificent tree should probably not be attempted in the St. Louis area.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Psidium littorale, commonly called strawberry guava, is an evergreen, tropical to sub-tropical small fruiting tree or multi-stemmed shrub which is native to Brazil. In the wild, this plant is primarily shrubby in appearance and typically grows from 10-15’ (sometimes to 25’) tall. In the St. Louis area where it must be grown in containers, it will probably grow no taller than 6’. Grown primarily for its fragrant white spring flowers, its greenish-gray to yellowish-brown bark and its spicy sweet berry-like fruit. White flowers with numerous stamens appear in spring. Flowers are edible and may be used as a garnish. Flowers give way in summer to dark red guava fruits (1-1.5” diameter) which have white flesh and a sweet but tangy strawberry-guava flavor. Fruits may be eaten fresh off the plant or used in jellies or juices. Elliptic to obovate, glossy green leaves (to 3” long) emerge bronze.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pulsatilla halleri, commonly known as alpine pasque flower, is an herbaceous perennial that typically matures to 8-12” tall.  It is native to mountain meadows, slopes and grassy hills from the Alps in central Europe to Crimea and the Caucasus.  Rich, solitary, scapose, shallow bell-shaped, upright, almost crocus-like, violet-blue flowers (to 2 1/2” across) bloom in spring atop stems rising to 6-8” tall.  Flowers bloom as the pinnate basal leaves (2-6” long) begin to unfurl.  Each leaf contains 3-5 pinnatifid leaflets with oblong lance-shaped lobes plus a long-stalked terminal leaflet.  Leaves and stems are covered with long silky hairs. Flowers are followed by fluffy ornamental seedheads.  

Pasque comes from Old French for Easter in reference to the spring bloom time.  

Anemone halleri is a synonym and former name for this plant.Genus name comes from Latin meaning sway as the flowers sway in the wind.Specific epithet honors German botanist Hans Hallier (1868-1932).

Culture
Best grown in lean, dry to medium, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Plants also tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. If grown ornamentally, plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens. Cultivars also extend the range of flower colors to include pinks, reds, creams, yellows and bicolor pastels.Genus name is in reference to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.Specific epithet means thousand-leaved in reference to the foliage.Common yarrow has a large number of additional common names, including milfoil, thousandleaf, soldier’s woundwort, bloodwort, nose bleed, devil’s nettle, sanguinary, old-man’s-pepper and stenchgrass.‘Pomegranate’ is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright yarrow that is noted for its bright magenta flowers, ferny aromatic foliage, compact size and vigorous growing habit. It is a naturally-occurring cultivar that was discovered in 2003 growing within a population of Achillea millefolium 'Summer Pastels'. Flowers appear in dense, flattened clusters (compound corymbs to 2-4” across) over a long summer bloom period on compact stems rising to 18-24” tall. Flower color holds well as flowers mature. Deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green leaves have a somewhat spicy aroma which may persist when used in dried arrangements. U.S. Plant Patent PP20,763 was issued on February 16, 2010. 'Pomegranate' is a member of the Tutti Frutti Series of yarrows that have been developed in The Netherlands. Other Tutti Frutti Series cultivars include 'Apricot Delight' (apricot flowers), 'Pineapple Mango' (yellow/salmon flowers), 'Pink Grapefruit' (rose flowers) and 'Wonderful Wampee' (pale pink flowers).
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Plant stems are weak and lodge easily. If grown ornamentally, plants can develop into a tangled mass of stems and foliage by mid to late summer if not cut back. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can easily flatten exposed plantings. May spread somewhat aggressively.‘Pomegranate’ has more compact stems and may be better able to deal with nasty summer weather than taller A. millefolium varieties.

Best grown in rich, humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Adapts to a wide range of soils. Tolerant of heat and humidity. First respectable crops of acorns may occur as early as 10 years. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout the St. Louis area (particularly young trees).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus acutissima, commonly called sawtooth oak, is a medium sized deciduous oak that is included in a section called the ""Cerris"" group, which has traits that are somewhat intermediate between the red and white oak sections. It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a broad-spreading, rounded crown. Gray to black bark develops corky ridging with age. It is native to China, Korea and Japan. Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 1” long), with spiny, scaly cups that extend to approximately 2/3 the acorn length. Acorn crops can be quite abundant and are an important source of food for wildlife. Oblong to lance-shaped, chestnut-like, glossy dark green leaves (to 7” long) have bristle-tipped marginal teeth at the terminal point of each parallel vein. Fall color is variable, ranging from an attractive golden brown to undistinguished pale brown.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet means exceedingly acute or sharp in reference to the sawtooth leaf margins.
","
Problems
Chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves) is common in neutral to alkaline soils, and can severely damage the tree. Otherwise, sawtooth oak is considered to be a low-maintence tree with good pest resistance. Oaks in general are susceptible to a large number of diseases, including oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew. Potential insect pests include scale, oak skeletonizer, leaf miner, galls, oak lace bugs, borers, caterpillars and nut weevils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus alba, commonly called white oak, is a large deciduous Missouri native tree of the white oak group. It typically occurs in dry upland slopes and ledges as well as lowland valleys and ravines throughout the State. Grows to 50-80' tall in cultivation and taller (to 100') in the wild. Pyramidal when young, but matures into a substantial tree with a wide-spreading, rounded crown. Insignificant yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring shortly after the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 3/4"" long) with warty-scaled cups. Leaves (4-9"" long) have 7 to 9 deep rounded lobes. Leaves emerge pinkish in spring, but mature to dark green. Variable fall color ranges from uninteresting browns to quality shades of dark red. White oak grows over much of eastern North America and is an important hardwood timber tree. Widely used in landscapes, but slow growth rate and large size has somewhat tempered its popularity. 

White oak is the Illinois State Tree.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Species name of alba means white in reference to the light ash-gray bark.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus ellipsoidalis, commonly called northern pin oak, hill’s oak or jack oak, is a medium-sized deciduous oak of the red oak group that typically grows 50-70’ tall with a cylindrical shape and rounded crown. Upper branches are ascending, but lower branches descend toward the ground. In the wild, the lower branches are often shaded by other trees, with some branches eventually dying and breaking off leaving persistent pin-like stubs, hence the pin oak part of the common name. This tree is primarily native to dry sandy sites including dry upland woods from northern Missouri to northwestern Ohio north into southern Canada (Manitoba and Ontario). Elliptic dark green leaves (3-7” long) have 5-9 deeply incised, bristle-tipped lobes. Leaves turn a relatively non-showy russet red in fall. Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are elliptic acorns (to 3/4” long), with saucer-shaped acorn cups that cover 1/3 to 1/ 2 of the acorn. Acorns mature at the end of two seasons. Acorns are an important food source for wildlife (e.g., deer, bears, squirrels, small rodents and some birds). Smooth gray-black to dark brown bark usually develops ridging with age. Trunks mature over time to a diameter to 3’. Northern pin oak is similar in appearance to pin oak (Quercus palustris). Pin oak is primarily a lowland tree that is native to areas south of the more upland northern pin oak. One distinguishing difference is that the acorns of northern pin oak are narrower and longer than those of pin oak.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet is in reference to ellipsoidal acorns.
","
Problems
Chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) is common in alkaline soils and can severely damage this tree. Northern pin oak is otherwise infrequently attacked by the common diseases of oaks which include oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew. Potential insect pests include scale, oak skeletonizer, leaf miner, galls, oak lace bugs, borers, caterpillars and nut weevils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus imbricaria, commonly called shingle oak, is a medium sized deciduous oak of the red oak group that typically grows in a conical form to 40-60’ tall, with the crown broadening and rounding with age. Trunk diameter to 3’. Brownish gray bark develops shallow furrowing and ridging with age. Shingle oak is native primarily from Pennsylvania to Iowa and Arkansas. It is particularly common in the Ohio River Valley. In Missouri, it occurs in a variety of locations thoughout the state, including upland dry woods, prairie margins, slopes, ravines, stream margins and bottomlands (Steyermark). Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are rounded acorns (to 3/4” long), with scaly cups that extend to approximately 1/3 the acorn length. The acorns do not ripen until fall of the second year, as is the case with most oaks in the red oak group. Acorns are an important source of food for wildlife. Narrow, oblong, smooth-margined, glossy dark green leaves (3-6” long and 1-2” wide) are pale and pubescent beneath. Fall color is variable, sometimes producing attractive shades of yellow-brown to red-brown. Old leaves tend to persist on the tree throughout most of the winter.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet comes from Latin and means to place in an overlapping order, as with tile or shingles.Wood was once used by early settlers in the midwest for shingles, hence the common name.

Trunk diameter extends to 3.5’. Brownish gray bark becomes grayish black with age with rough scaly ridging. Water oak is native primarily from New Jersey to Florida and Texas, extending northward along the Mississippi River valley to western Kentucky, southern Illinois and the Missouri bootheel. It is typically found in low woodland areas, floodplains and along streams and rivers. Insignificant monoecious flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring. Fruits are broad-rounded acorns (to 1/2” long) in short-stalked cups with woolly scales. Acorns are a source of food for wildlife. Narrow, smooth-margined, spatula-shaped, oblong leaves (2-4” long and 1-2” wide) are three-lobed to entire at the tips. Leaves are dull bluish-green above and paler with pubescence beneath. Old leaves tend to drop in late fall to early winter, but may persist on the tree throughout most of the winter in the southern parts of the growing range (particularly within USDA Zones 8-9).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet means black.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus phellos, commonly called willow oak, is a medium to large, deciduous oak tree of the red oak group that is noted for its oak shape, willow-like leaves and relatively fast growth rate. It is native to the Southeastern United States, typically being found in moist bottomland soils. In Missouri, it is usually found in wet or low woods bordering swamps, streams and canals in a few counties in the far southeastern portion of the state (Steyermark). Willow oak typically grows 40-75’ tall with an oval to rounded crown, but may reach 100’ in ideal conditions. Smooth-edged, bristle-tipped, narrow, green leaves (to 5” long and 1” wide) are willow-like. Leaves turn an undistinguished yellow-brown or dull gold in fall. Fruits are rounded acorn cups (to 1/2” long). Acorns can be an important source of food for wildlife. Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring (April) as the leaves emerge. Dark, irregularly-furrowed trunks (gray to dark gray-brown) develop on mature trees.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet means cork.
","
Problems

Fall color appears late, but is often a respectable brownish red. Insignificant flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in early spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are acorns which are usually not produced until the tree has reached the age of 25 years. Indigenous to central and southern Missouri in moist locations in bottomlands and lowlands, including sites along streams and lakes, valleys, floodplains and at the edge of swamps. However, in the St. Louis area, it is most often found on dry, elevated sites. Similar in appearance and habit to scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.
","
Problems
Generally a durable and long-lived tree, but is susceptible to a large number of potential diseases and insect pests, including anthracnose, canker, leaf spot, rust, blight, galls, caterpillars, borers, leaf miners, oak lace bug and oak mite. Chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves while the veins remain green) often occurs when soils are not properly acidic. Can be difficult to transplant and establish.
","
Garden Uses
Shade tree, street tree, lawn tree. Does well in wide range of soils from dry locations to wet ground and low spots.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it  is best grown in rich, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Intolerant of frost.   In temperate climates, plants may be grown in containers as houseplants.  Best with a soil based potting mix.  Indoor plants prefer bright indirect light (avoid direct full sun) including several hours per day of curtain-filtered sun from east, west or southern windows.   Keep container soils consistently moist but not wet.  Soils should not be allowed to dry out.  Indoor plants perform best with 70-75 degrees F. temperatures during the day and 60-65 degrees F. temperatures at night.  This plant tolerates the dry indoor conditions found in many homes, but appreciates regular misting of the foliage.  Container plants may be placed on patios or porches in protected positions in semi-shade during summer, but must be brought indoors prior to first fall frost date.  Prune as needed to prevent legginess.  Propagate by stem cuttings in summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Radermachera sinica, commonly called China doll, serpent tree or emerald tree, is a broad-leaved evergreen tree that is native to subtropical mountain areas of southern China and Taiwan.  In its native habitat in optimum growing conditions, this tree will grow to as much as 90' tall featuring bipinnate compound leaves (to 30"" long) with glossy dark green leaflets (to 2"" long) and fragrant, trumpet-shaped, crinkly-petaled, white or yellow flowers (each to 3"" long) which bloom in panicles at the leaf axils or branch ends in spring and summer.  Flowers are followed by non-showy fruits in slender capsules.  In cultivation in frost free climates, this tree usually grows to a much smaller 25-30' tall.  In more temperate climates, China doll has become a very popular foliage houseplant (it rarely produces flowers indoors) which often tops out at 4-6' tall.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Stereospermum sinicum.Genus name honors amateur botanist J. C. M. Radermacher (d. 1983) Dutch resident of Java.Specific epithet means Chinese.

Needle palm is noted for its excellent winter hardiness. In a protected location, it is considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 6b. It is typically grown in organically rich, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best performance is in part-shade. Site in protected locations that are sheltered from winter winds. Mature plants will often survive some winter temperatures to -5 degrees F. Mulch around the base of the plant in winter. Plants will sucker along the stems, sometimes profusely, to form dense clumps. Propagate from suckers or from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Rhapidophyllum hystrix, commonly called needle palm, is a shrubby, clumping, nearly trunkless, fan palm that grows to 3-6’ tall and as wide. It is native to moist to wet woodlands, slopes, ravines and stream bottomland in the southeastern U. S. (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi). It is one of the hardiest if not the hardiest of the palms. It is noted for its large, palmate, glossy green leaves that grow on long upright petioles (to 30” long). Each deeply divided leaf (almost to the base) is fan-shaped (to 30 inches across) with 5-12 narrow segments (each to 20” long). Leaves are evergreen. The common name of needle palm are both in reference to the long, stiff, sharply-pointed, needle-like, black spines (to 6” long) that project from the leaf sheaths. Spines make the clumps impenetrable to most wildlife. Three-petaled, yellow-brown flowers in small dense clusters bloom in early summer among the leaf sheaths. Flowers are usually hidden by the foliage. Fruit is a reddish brown drupe.Genus name comes from the Greek rhaphis meaning needle and phyllon meaning leaf for the needle-like appendages of the leaf sheaths.Specific epithet from Greek means porcupine.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Rhus glabra, commonly called smooth sumac, is a Missouri native, deciduous shrub which occurs on prairies, fields, abandoned farmland, clearings and along roads and railroads throughout the State. A large, open, irregular, spreading shrub which typically grows 8-15' tall and spreads by root suckers to form thickets or large colonies in the wild. Very similar to staghorn sumac (R. typhina), except the young stems of staghorn are densely pubescent whereas those of this species are smooth, hence the common name. Large, compound pinnate, shiny, dark green leaves (each with 9-27 leaflets) grow to 18"" long with a fern-like appearance and turn attractive shades of bright orange to red in autumn. Tiny, yellowish-green flowers bloom in terminal panicles (5-10"" long) in late spring to early summer, with separate male and female flowers appearing on separate plants (dioecious). Female plants produce showy, erect, pyramidal fruiting clusters (to 8"" long). Each cluster contains numerous hairy, berry-like drupes which ripen red in autumn, gradually turning maroon-brown as they persist through most of the winter. Fruit is attractive to wildlife.Genus name comes from the Greek name for one species, Rhus coriaria.Specific epithet means without hairs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spot, rust, scale, aphids and mites. Tends to spread aggressively.
","
Garden Uses
Best when massed for stabilizing embankments or for hard-to-cover areas with poorer soils or for naturalizing in wild areas. Has some nice ornamental features (ferny foliage, hairy stems, fruiting clusters and fall foliage), but is probably too weedy and aggressive for shrub borders.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Rhus aromatica, commonly called fragrant sumac, is a deciduous Missouri native shrub which occurs in open woods, glades and thickets throughout the State. A dense, low-growing, rambling shrub which spreads by root suckers to form thickets in the wild. Typically grows 2-4' tall (less frequently to 6') and spreads to 10' wide. Trifoliate, medium green leaves turn attractive shades of orange, red and purple in autumn. Leaves and twigs are aromatic when bruised (hence the species name). Although smaller, the leaves resemble in appearance those of the related poison ivy (Rhus radicans). However fragrant sumac is a totally non-poisonous plant. Tiny yellow flowers bloom at the twig tips in early spring before the foliage. Separate male flowers (in catkins) and female flowers (in clusters) appear on the same plants (monoecious) or, more commonly, on different plants (dioecious). Male catkins form in late summer and persist throughout the winter until eventually blooming in spring. Female flowers give way in late summer to small clusters of hairy, red berries which may persist into winter. Fruit is attractive to wildlife.Genus name comes from the Greek name for one species, Rhus coriaria.Specific epithet means fragrant.

Ribes alpinum, commonly called alpine currant, is a compact, mound-forming shrub which grows 3-6' tall. Bright green leaves are 3-5 lobed, turning to a dull yellow in fall. Flowers are greenish-yellow and inconspicuous. Dioecious (separate male and female plants). Fruit on female plants is an inedible, scarlet berry. However, most plants of this species which are sold commercially are male clones (males are reportedly immune to rust diseases). Stems are chestnut brown and may exfoliate (peel) as they mature.Genus name comes from the Danish word ribs meaning red currant.Specific epithet means of the alpine.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In wet, humid conditions, anthracnose and leaf spot can be troublesome. Currant aphid, scale and currant bud mite are occasional insect pests. Although white pine blister rust is not a problem in Missouri, females of this species may be an alternate host for the disease and should not be planted in parts of the U.S. where the disease is prevalent (particularly in the East and Northwest). Fourteen (14) states still maintain various types of bans on Ribes, the most restrictive being the total ban on all species in North Carolina. Missouri has no restrictions on Ribes plants.

Appreciates a good compost mulch for the root zone. Water regularly as needed to keep soils uniformly moist. Avoid overhead watering however. Plants are self-fertile. Often sold as bare root plants by nurseries. Space 3' apart. Prune as needed during the dormant season. It is generally recommended that stems older than 2 years on black currants be removed. May take 4-5 years for plants to become well-established and reach full fruit-bearing potential.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ribes nigrum, commonly known as black currant is primarily grown for fruit production. Clusters of greenish-yellow flowers bloom in spring, and are noticeable but not particularly ornamental. Flowers give way to long, pendant clusters of black currants which ripen in June-July. Medium green leaves are 3-5 lobed, and are aromatic when crushed. Currants may be eaten ripe off the shrub or used to make jams, jellies and pies.Genus name comes from the Danish word ribs meaning red currant.Specific epithet means black.'Ben Sarek' is a compact, mounding, deciduous shrub which grows 3-4' tall.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In wet, humid conditions, anthracnose, powdery mildew and fungal leaf spot can be troublesome. Currant aphid, scale, currant bud mite and currant fruit fly are potential insect pests in some areas. Black currants are an alternate host for white pine blister rust, a usually fatal disease for white pines. Fourteen (14) states currently maintain various types of bans on Ribes species plants, the most restrictive being the total ban on all Ribes plants in North Carolina. Missouri has no restrictions. Notwithstanding state and local legislation, black currants should not be planted in any area where the disease is prevalent (particularly the East and Northwest). In areas where the disease is not prevalent (such as Missouri), it is still best to avoid planting black currents in locations where white pines are growing unless rust-immune cultivars (e.g., 'Consort') are used.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Sabal etoinia, commonly known as scrub palmetto or scrub palm, is a small, shrubby, evergreen palm which features a subterranean trunk and a crown bud that is located below the soil surface.  This palm is native to the central and southeastern scrublands of Florida.  It is commonly found and protected in the Ocala National Forest.  Although its native habitat only exists in the State of Florida, it is not considered at this time to be an endangered species.  

Each plant features 4 to 7, costopalmate leaves (to 3’ across), with each leaf featuring 25-50 narrow, rigid, pointed one-ribbed segments in the shape of a fan.  Segments are joined at the base.  Segments develop marginal thread-like filaments as they mature.  Plants typically grow to 3-4’ (less frequently to 6’) tall and to 4-5’ wide.  Fragrant white flowers bloom in spring-summer in inflorescences rising to the same height as the leaves, but often shorter.  Flowers are followed by fleshy, spherical to ovoid, one-seeded drupes (to 1/2” long) that mature to black.Genus name is of unclear origin and meaning, but may have been derived from the Latin name for palmetto.

Culture
Grow in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers full sun. Thrives in moist soils, but tolerates somewhat drier soils better than most other willows. Prune as needed in late winter to early spring. Plants may be cut to the ground every 3-5 years to maintain a smaller shrub shape.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Salix caprea, commonly called pussy willow or goat willow, is native to Europe and Asia. It is a large shrub or small tree that typically grows to 12-25’ tall and to 15’ wide. It also may be trained as a smaller hedge. It has escaped cultivation and naturalized in parts of Eastern North America. This is a dioecious species (male and female catkins appearing on separate trees) that many consider to be the best of the “pussy willows”. Before the foliage emerges in late winter, male trees produce a showy display of catkins (1-2” long) that are pinkish gray and woolly. These catkins are larger than the pearl gray male catkins that appear on the American native plant most commonly called pussy willow (Salix discolor). Female trees produce smaller greenish catkins. Broad elliptic to oblong leaves (to 6” long) are dark green above and gray-hairy beneath. Variable fall color is usually an undistinguished greenish-yellow.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning goat.
","
Problems
Susceptible to numerous disease problems including blights, powdery mildew, leaf spots and cankers. It also is visited by many insect pests including aphids, scale, borers, lacebugs and caterpillars. Wood is weak and may crack. Branches may be damaged by ice and snow. Litter from leaves, twigs and branches may be a problem. Shallow roots may clog sewers or drains and make gardening underneath the plants difficult.
","
Garden Uses
If growing this plant as an ornamental, make sure to purchase a male plant which will produce the showy late winter catkins. Goat willow may be grown in moist soils along streams, ponds or in low spots in the landscape where other shrubs or small trees may falter. It will also grow in average garden soils. Plants may be regularly cut back for use as a hedge.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Prefers moist, light, gravelly or sandy soils with good drainage.  Tolerates drought.  Avoid wet soils in winter.  This sage is a biennial or short-lived perennial.  When grown from seed, it produces downy, wrinkled, silver-gray rosettes of foliage the first year with flowering stems rising above foliage in the second year.  Flowering stems may be promptly cut off as they appear to showcase the plant foliage and to encourage perennial tendencies.  Plants that flower and seed in the second year complete their biennial course and disappear from the garden.  Some gardeners prefer to let plants bloom for enjoyment of the flowers.  Plants may continue in the garden from year to year, albeit in slightly different locations, by self-seeding.  Plant foliage tends to struggle and decline as summer progresses in hot and humid conditions south of USDA Zone 7a.  This plant is often grown as an annual.  Propagate by seed or removal of rooted lateral offshoots in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Salvia argentea, commonly called silver sage, is a clump-forming biennial or short-lived perennial that is native to the Mediterranean area (southern Europe to northern Africa).  Unlike most salvias, plants of this species are grown primarily for their large, woolly leaves and not for their flowers.  In the first year, this sage features a large rosette of soft, felt-like, broad-oval, downy, wrinkled, silver-gray leaves (to 8"" long by 6"" wide) that form an attractive foliage mound to 12"" tall and to 20"" wide.  Leaves emerge silver-white in spring but gradually mature to silver-gray to greenish-gray as the summer progresses.  In the second year, silver flower spikes rise well above the foliage to 2-3' tall, topped with tubular, hooded, white flowers that are tinged with pink.  Flowers bloom in early summer.The genus name Salvia comes from the Latin word salveo meaning ""to save or heal"", in reference to the purported medically curative properties attributed to some plants in the genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word argentum meaning silver in reference to the young leaves that emerge silver-white in spring.

Culture
With good humidity, consistent soil moisture, warm air temperature, and an absence of direct sun, this tropical perennial will usually develop into an extremely attractive indoor foliage plant.  Best indoor container growth typically occurs in uniformly moist, well-drained, peaty potting mixtures in room temperatures ranging from 65 to 75 degrees F. in limited sun to bright shade locations.  Avoid full sun, particularly in the heat of the afternoon.  Tolerates some early morning sun or diffused sun.  Avoid drafts or sudden temperature changes.  Plants need high humidity which can often be difficult to provide in winter.  Consider standing a potted plant on a bed of wet pebbles, misting the foliage regularly and/or growing the plant in a humidified room.  During the growing season (April-August), water regularly to keep soils moist (but not wet) and apply a balanced fertilizer monthly.  Reduce watering and fertilization in winter when plant growth typically slows down.   Propagate by division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calathea lancifolia, commonly known as rattlesnake plant, is a rhizomatous tropical evergreen perennial that it winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12.  It is native to Brazilian rainforests.  Although it may be grown outdoors at the far southern edges of Florida and California plus Hawaii, it is otherwise grown indoors in the remaining parts of the U. S. for appreciation of its ornately patterned foliage.  Flowers rarely appear on indoor plants.  Plants typically grow to 1 1/2’ tall indoors, but rise to 2 1/2’ tall outdoors.  Wavy-margined linear to lanceolate leaf blades (each to 18” long) are pale green to yellow-green above variegated with (a) attractive dark green elliptic blotches on both sides of the midrib, (b) thin dark olive green marginal edge, and (c) reddish purple to maroon undersides.  The markings on each leaf purportedly resemble the markings found on some rattlesnakes, hence the common name for this plant.  On plants grown outdoors, yellow flowers bloom seasonally, but typically from late spring to early summer in 2-4” long conical spikes.  

In the tropics, this plant is commonly grown outdoors in shaded areas and courtyards for display of its highly ornamental foliage.Genus name comes from the Latin word calathus meaning basket in reference to the inflorescence looking like a basket of flowers.Specific epithet means lance-leaved in reference to the lance-shaped leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, scale, mealybugs and spider mites.   Leaf spots may appear.  Plants do not thrive in low humidity where leaves may roll or brown up.   Direct sun usually causes leaf scorch.

Culture
Strict adherence to the cultural needs of this plant is essential. In residential areas, this plant is best grown in the consistently moist soils of a bog garden. The bog garden should be prepared in advance of planting. In the St. Louis area, the bog garden should be sited in a protected location with a winter mulch. If a bog garden is not available, then growing plants in containers may be the next best option. Plants require full sun. In part shade, leaf coloring does not develop as it should and pitchers droop. Plants need an acidic, humusy muck that is constantly damp but not watery. Soils must never dry out, but plant crowns should not sit for prolonged periods in water. Soil recommendations include Canadian peat or mixes of peat/sand or peat/perlite. Irrigation hoses and underground liners should be considered. Plants have a horizontal rhizome. Plants flower in spring, produce new pitchers in spring-summer and the pitchers mostly die back as winter approaches. In cold climates, trim leaves back in winter as pitchers die, but only trim dead tissue. Linear, sword-shaped leaves may remain evergreen in winter. Soil may be mulched with pine needles in winter to protect plants from cold temperatures. Most reproduction comes from continuous budding along the rhizome as opposed to self-seeding. Easiest propagation is by rhizome division. Plants may be grown from seed with effort, but will not flower for the first 4-5 years. Plants may also be grown in pots/containers (plastic best) placed outside on a sunny deck or patio area. Container soils can be 50% peat and 50% perlite/vermiculite. Potting soil and/or fertilizer may kill the plant. Containers should be placed in a tray of water that keeps the soil constantly moist. Containers may be overwintered by inserting them to the rim in soil in protected locations. Dig up containers in spring to place back in full sun areas. Containers may also be brought inside in winter with somewhat reduced watering. Plants need full sun in the growing season and cold temperatures in winter dormancy, hence they simply do not grow well as houseplants. Do not collect these plants from the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pitcher plants are described as carnivorous plants because they trap and kill insects (e.g., flies, ants, beetles, wasps) and similar prey (e.g., mites, spiders) by luring them into trumpet-shaped pitchers (modified leaves) where the insects become trapped and die. Nutrients from the decayed pest bodies are absorbed by the plant as nourishment through special cells located at the base of each pitcher. 

Sarracenia x catesbaei (S. purpurea x S. flava) is a naturally occurring hybrid pitcher plant that is infrequently found in sandy bogs, wet seeps and savannas in coastal plain areas from Virginia to Florida. While many hybrids in the plant world are sterile, this hybrid will not only produce viable seed but may further hybridize. It is a stemless herbaceous perennial that grows in mucky soils usually in full sun. Modified leaves form upright, slender-fluted pitchers rising to 15” tall. Pitchers are narrow with an erect to slightly horizontal lid that prevents some rain from entering the tube. Lids are attractive landing sites for flying insects. Insects are lured to the pitchers by the attractive leaf colors and nectar. Nectar reportedly has a paralyzing effect on insects. Each pitcher is slippery inside, and insects fall down the tube into a digestive juice liquid at the bottom of the pitcher. Insects decompose and nutrients are absorbed. Pitcher color is sometimes variable. Typical form is yellow with red veins, gradually changing to maroon. In spring, before the pitchers emerge, a single, 5-petaled, brick red flower (to 2” diameter) rises on a leafless stalk to 12” tall. Flowers typically have a strong musty fragrance. Each flower is followed by a 5-parted seed capsule. New pitcher leaves appear in spring and summer replacing old leaves that die and fall off.Genus name honors Dr. Michael Sarrasin de l’Etang of Quebec who reportedly sent the first pitcher plants to Europe around 1700.Specific epithet honors Mark Catesby (1682-1749) of Sudbury, England. He was the author of A Natural History of North Carolina.
","
Problems
Plants will do poorly if specific cultural requirements are not followed. Protect from strong freezing winds. Winter hardiness is generally not a problem in the St. Louis area for this plant. Feeding plants manually is not advisable. Do not fertilize plantings. Watch for aphids, scale, mealybugs, moth larvae, leaf spot and root rot.
","
Garden Uses
Bog garden is best. Also may be grown in containers, greenhouses or as an indoor houseplant. Growth in containers as an indoor plant can be difficult because of the need for growing season sun and winter dormancy. May be grown outside in low spots or other continuously moist locations, but this can be difficult and is not recommended.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Thrives in sandy to gravelly soils of moderate to low fertility. Tolerates some light part shade in hot summer climates, but will produce weak floppy growth when grown in too much shade or in overly rich soils. Needs good soil drainage to perform well. Drought tolerant. Propagate by divisions in spring or stem cuttings in summer. Detached leaves can be rooted in soil to form new plants. Plants may be cut back in late spring to control height.‘Blade Runner’ prefers some part afternoon light shade in hot summer climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hylotelephium is a genus of about 33 species of drought-tolerant herbaceous perennials native to Asia, Europe and North America. They are commonly called stonecrop and are excellent plants for fall gardens. Many species and hybrids were formerly place in the genus Sedum.Genus name probably honor Telephus, King of Mysia and son of Hercules.Many hylotelephiums and sedums are commonly called stonecrop in reference to the frequent sighting of the genus in the wild growing on rocks or stony ledges.‘Blade Runner’ is noted for its toothed foliage that reportedly resembles the serrated blade of a knife, hence the common name. It typically grows in an upright mound to 15” tall and as wide. Fleshy foliage is apple green. Reddish purple flowers in cymes bloom in late summer atop stems rising above the foliage.
","
Problems
Slugs, scale, mealybugs, nematodes, aphids and weevils may appear. Rotting out is possible in wet and/or poorly drained conditions. Taller sedum hybrids with large flower heads are susceptible to flopping. This can be avoided by providing full sun conditions and planting in soils that are not too moist or rich. Pinching in spring can also force stems to grow thicker and bushier.
","
Garden Uses
Rock gardens or border fronts. Specimen or groups. Containers.May be used for edging.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sedum acre, commonly called common stonecrop or gold moss stonecrop, is a tiny, rhizomatous, tuberous-rooted, carpet-forming, evergreen succulent perennial which typically grows to only 3” tall but spreads in a moss-like fashion along the ground to 24” or more to form an interesting and often impressive ground cover.  It is native to Europe, Northern Africa and Western Asia where it is primarily found in rock crevices, ravine edges and scrubby areas.  Plants are thickly clothed with blunt, conical, pale green leaves (each to only 1/4” long).  Leaves overlap in shingle-like fashion.  Small, terminal clusters of tiny, star-shaped, five-petaled, yellow flowers (each to 1/2” across) bloom in flat terminal inflorescences just above the foliage throughout most of the summer.Genus name comes from the Latin word sedeo meaning to sit in reference to the general growing habit of many of the sedums (they sit and sprawl over rocks).Specific epithet is named for its acrid taste.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs and snails.  Scale may occur.

Although technically winter hardy to the deep South, it does not grow well there.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sequoia sempervirens, called coast redwood, is so named because it is native to moist, foggy, coastal plain areas along the Pacific coast, now being primarily confined to a narrow coastal belt (to 20 miles inland) extending from southern Oregon south to the San Francisco Bay area. This is a narrow-conical, evergreen conifer that is typically found, sometimes in magnificent pure strands, in high moisture coastal areas that are regularly blanketed with fog rolling in from the Pacific. In this native habitat, it is a magnificent, long-lived tree that is generally considered to be the tallest tree in the world, growing to 350’ with a trunk diameter of 20-25’. Although fast-growing in its native habitat, it still may take 400+ years for a redwood to reach maturity. But, it can live to 2000 years or more. In cultivation outside of its native habitat, it will grow much smaller, typically to 60-90’ tall. Coast redwood features flat, bright green needles (to 1” long), oblong seed cones to 1.25” long and furrowed, reddish-brown bark on a straight trunk that is flared outward at the base. This is a prized lumber tree for its rot-resistant wood that is straight-grained and knot-free. Many trees have been protected in areas such as Redwood National Park, Muir Woods and a number of California State Parks. 

Sequoia sempervirens along with its close cousin Sequoiadendron gigantea (giant sequoia) are jointly designated as the State Tree of California.Genus name honors George Gist (1770-1843) born to a  German-American merchant and an American Indian girl and was known as Sequoia or Sequioish. He was the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet.Specific epithet means ever green.'Soquel' is a pyramidal evergreen tree with reddish brown bark and horizontal branches that curve upwards at the tips. Its finely textured needles are dark green with bluish or grayish undersides. The color holds well in winter. 'Soquel' is smaller than the species, especially when not grown in its native habitat, and grows slowly to 50 to 90 ft. tall and 15 to 30 ft. wide.

Intolerant of dry soils. Generally intolerant of temperature extremes. It is not recommended for planting in the St. Louis area in large part because of climatic conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sequoiadendron giganteum, known as giant sequoia, has the most massive size of any tree in the world. It is an erect, single-trunk (often buttressed at the base), needled evergreen conifer that is native to groves scattered through montane coniferous forests along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains (4500-8000 feet in elevation) in central California. In its native California habitat, mature trees will often grow to 200-275’ tall, produce trunk diameters ranging from 15-20’ and weigh 200 or more tons. Trees may live 2000-3000 years. Young trees have a pyramidal-oval shape. As trees mature, they begin to lose branches from the lower part of the trunk. Trees generally feature attractive dark cinnamon-brown bark (with deep furrows and ridges), small, scale-like, appressed, blue green needles and fruiting cones to 2.5” long. Trees may be planted in the eastern U.S., but typically will grow to only 40-60’ tall. Giant sequoia was originally discovered in 1833 by Zenas Leonard. A very large percentage of giant sequoias in California are now protected in parks, including Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Sequoiadendron giganteum and its close relative, Sequoia sempervirens (redwood), are jointly designated as the State Tree of California. Other common names are big tree and giant redwood.Genus name comes from the word Sequoia plus the Greek word dendron meaning tree.Specific epithet means giant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Dieback, blight and butt rot may occur.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sisyrinchium angustifolium, commonly called blue-eyed grass, is noted for its violet-blue flowers and branched flowering stems. Though its foliage is grass-like, the blue-eyed grasses belong to the iris family not the grass family. It is native to Missouri where it occurs in damp open woods, slopes and along stream banks throughout much of the State. It is a clump-forming perennial that features a tuft of narrow grass-like leaves (to 3/16"" wide) typically growing to 12"" (less frequently to 20"") tall. Clusters of violet-blue flowers (to 1/2"" across), each with 6 pointed tepals and a yellow eye, appear in spring on stalks growing from leaf-like bracts atop usually branched flowering stems which are distinctively flattened. Sisyrinchium campestre, also a Missouri native, features pale blue to white flowers atop unbranched flowering stems. S. angustifolium includes plants formerly classified as S. bermudianum.Genus name comes from the ancient Greek name for another plant.Specific epithet means narrow-leaved.
","
Problems

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist soils.  Established plants have some drought tolerance, however.  Plants can become somewhat weedy and difficult to eradicate from areas of the landscape due to its extensive root system.  Deadhead spent flowers to help prevent naturalization by wind-blown seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea pandurata, commonly called wild potato vine, man-of-the-earth, man root and Indian potato, is a vigorous, twining or trailing perennial vine of the morning glory family that grows to 15-30’ long on smooth to slightly pubescent, sometimes purplish stems rising from a vertical, starchy root system that matures over time to as much as 4’ long with a weigh of 25-30 pounds.  This vine is native to moist to somewhat dry habitats including fallow and cultivated fields, roadsides, dry slopes, railroad right-of-ways, and along streams in Eastern North America from Connecticut to Ontario to Michigan and Iowa south to Texas and Florida.  It typically sprawls along the ground in open areas or climbs vegetation.  It is found throughout most of the State of Missouri.  

This vine is noted for its large, funnel-shaped, white flowers (2-3” across) with reddish purple eyes.  Flowers bloom from the leaf axils in cymose inflorescences composed of up to 7 perfect actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) flowers from late May to September.  The funnelform corolla of each flower has five shallow lobes.  Simple, polymorphic (variable), olive green leaves are thin, entire, alternate, petiolate, cordate to ovate or occasionally pandurate (fiddle-shaped), with each leaf extending to 3-6” long with a pointed tip.  Fruit is a glabrous, ovoid, 2-celled dehiscent capsule (to 3/5” long) which opens at maturity to disburse its hairy seeds to the wind.  

Roots can be cooked and were an important food source for native Americans but fresh uncooked roots have purgative properties.  Native Americans also used the roots for preparation of poultices, infusions and teas for treatment of a variety of medical problems including rheumatism, cholera, kidney disease, coughs, abdominal pains and constipation.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet means fiddle-like in reference to leaf shape.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Host for the sweet potato weevil.  Will often spread somewhat invasively in the landscape.

Culture
Eggplants are cold-sensitive and require a long warm season for best results. Plant seeds in sunny warm location in peat pots 8 to 10 weeks before transplanting into garden after all danger of frost is past and night temperatures are consistently at or above 65 degrees F. Eggplant roots are subject to cold damage and plants seldom recover from cold snaps. Plant in full sun in fertile, well-drained soil. Do not permit seedlings or young plants to suffer from low temperature or drought. Mulching between plants is useful. Space plants 18 to 24"" apart with 30 to 36"" between rows. Plants thrive in the heat of summer. Depending on the size of fruit you wish to harvest, pinch out terminal growth and blossoms to allow up to 6 fruits to mature or allow all fruits to set and harvest when small. For mature fruits, harvest after some color appears but always while fruits still have their glossy shine.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sometimes resembling little trees, these robust-sized plants up to 3' high and almost that wide can have purple-tinged green leaves, drooping violet 1 1/2-inch flowers and, depending on the cultivar, fruits from grape to almost football size in white, yellow, red, green, violet or purple.Genus name appears to come from the Latin word solamen meaning comfort, solace, or soothing in reference to the purported sedative and healing effects obtained from application of the leaves of some genus plants to cuts, wounds, inflammations or skin problems.Specific epithet refers to the melon-shaped fruit.
","
Problems
Subject to problems similar to other solanaceous crops (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers), including verticillium wilt. Avoid these problems by planting resistant cultivars and rotating with non-solanaceous crops. Flea beetles, tomato hornworms, Colorado potato beetles and cutworms can be problems.
","
Garden Uses
Eggplants can be prepared in many ways -- in stews, roasted or grilled, sauteed, stir-fried, breaded and fried, baked, pickled or stuffed. They can be spectacular centerpieces in large containers and very effective in flower garden settings.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, grow as garden annuals or in pots that can be overwintered indoors or as houseplants. Grow in moist, organically rich, loose soils in part shade. Tolerates full shade. Some recently developed cultivars tolerate full sun. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. Remove flower spikes as they appear. Pinch plant stem tips to keep plants compact and to promote bushiness. Seed cultivars can be started indoors from seed 8-12 weeks before last frost date. Inexpensive starter plants (in small pots or flats) can be purchased from most nurseries in spring for beds and containers. Containers may be brought inside in fall before frost for overwintering. Similarly, favorite plants may be dug and potted in fall for overwintering as houseplants. Cuttings from favorite plants (easily rooted in a glass of water or in clean potting soil) can also be taken in fall for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Plectranthus scutellarioides, commonly known as coleus, is a tropical evergreen tender perennial that has been a popular foliage plant since at least Victorian times.  It is native to Southeast Asia and Malaysia.  It has been assiduously hybridized over the years into a very large number of vegetatively propagated and seed propagated strains with an almost infinite number of leaf color combinations including most colors of the spectrum except true blue.  Cultivars range in size from dwarf 6” tall plants to large mounded 36” tall plants.  Four-sided stems are semi-succulent.  Showy multi-colored leaves are generally ovate to oblong and toothed.  Leaves frequently feature mixtures of colors in irregular patterns.  Blue to white nettle-like flowers (more common on seed strains) bloom in racemes in summer to early fall, but are not showy and tend to visually detract from the symmetry and attractiveness of the plants.  

Solenostemon scutellarioides and Coleus blumei are both synonyms and former names for this plant.Genus name comes from the Greek words plectron meaning spur and anthos meaning flower in reference to the spur-shaped flowers of some members of the genus.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Scutellaria which comes from the Latin word scutella meaning a small dish or saucer in reference to the shape of the persistent calyx after the flowers fade.

Culture
Best grown in moist, acidic, well-drained soils in full sun. As the common name suggests, this is a tree of cool mountain climates that dislikes hot and humid summers, and will not grow well south of USDA Zones 5-6. It does poorly in the St. Louis area.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sorbus aucuparia, commonly called European mountain ash, is native to Europe and Asia. It has been widely planted in northern North America as an ornamental and has naturalized in some parts of Canada and the northern U.S. It is primarily cultivated for its compound green leaves and attractive clusters of fall fruit. It is a small, deciduous tree that grows to 20-40’ tall with a narrow, upright-oval crown, usually rounding and opening with age. Compound, odd-pinnate, flat medium green leaves have 9-15 serrate, oblong-lanceolate leaflets (each leaflet to 2.5” long). Leaves turn yellow to reddish-purple in fall. Small, white, 5-petaled flowers (1/3” across) bloom in flattened corymbs in May. Flowers give way to pendant clusters of orange-red berry-like drupes in late summer. Cultivars are available in commerce featuring pink, yellow and bright red fruits. Mountain ashes have ash-like leaves, but are members of the rose family, and are not related to true ashes (Fraxinus), which are in the  olive family.Genus name comes from the Latin name sorbum for the fruit of the service tree (Sorbus domestica).
","
Problems
Bacterial fireblight can be a severe problem, causing scorched leaves at the branch ends. Scab can cause significant defoliation. Cankers, crown gall, powdery mildew and rust may also occur. Insect visitors include aphids, sawfly, scale and borers. Stressed trees are particularly vulnerable to borers and cankers.
","
Garden Uses
Lawn specimen or small shade tree for cool northern climates. May also be an effective street tree in areas where road salt is infrequently applied in winter. Not recommended for the St. Louis area.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Spartium junceum, commonly called Spanish broom, is a multi-stemmed, sparsely-leaved, deciduous shrub that is typically found in dry areas, open woodlands, disturbed sites and along roads in the Mediterranean area (southern Europe to northern Africa). It has escaped gardens and naturalized in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Where winter hardy, it typically grows to 6-10' tall. It is primarily grown for its bright yellow flowers and cylindrical green stems. Young stems are rush-like, bright green and basically leafless. Older stems will develop a woody bark. Stems branch at the top, with flowers appearing in showy racemes. Flowers (to 1"" long) are bright yellow, pea-shaped and fragrant. Flowers bloom July to frost. Flowers are followed by flat seed pods (each to 3"" long). Linear to lanceolate leaves (to 1"" long) are bright green. Leaves are small in size, quite sparse in number and ephemeral (each leaf lasts about 4 months). Considerable photosynthesis occurs in the young green stems.Genus name comes from the Greek word spartion for a kind of grass used in weaving and cordage.Specific epithet means rush-like.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can spread invasively to crowd out native plants. It is considered a noxious weed in Hawaii and Washington and a ""B"" designated weed in Oregon.

Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10-11 where plants are best grown in rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates part shade.  Consider raised beds as a way to create sharp drainage.  Thrives in sandy loams.  Avoid overwatering which may encourage the onset of root rot.  Root mulch helps retain soil moisture in hot summer climates.  In St. Louis, sweetleaf can be grown as an annual.  Purchase starter plants if available.  Seed (if obtainable) can be started indoors in early spring for planting outside after last spring frost date.  Plants may be grown in pots set out on patios during the growing season.  Snip off flower buds as they appear (best quality leaves occur prior to flowering).  Harvest leaves in fall.  If overwintering, bring pots indoors before first fall frost.  Cutting may be taken.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Stevia rebaudiana, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a tender perennial herb that is native to Paraguay and Brazil.  Plants typically grow with weak and floppy stems to 12-24"" tall. Plants have little ornamental attraction.  The attraction here is the sweet tasting leaves which contain glucoside compounds that  are 200-300 times sweeter by weight than cane sugar but with no calories.  To date, the FDA has only approved limited use for this plant in the U.S. (Rebaudioside A approved as dietary supplement but stevia leaves are not approved as food additive), but its potential as a sugar-substitute is huge.  Slender oblong leaves (to 1"") have a pronounced midrib.  Tubular flowers are white with no fragrance.  Harvest fresh leaves for use in teas.  Eat leaves directly off the plant.  Leaves may be dried and then saved in jars for future use.  Dried leaves are generally sweeter than fresh leaves.  Dried leaves may be ground up in a blender into stevia powder.Genus name honors Pedro Jaime Esteve (d. 1566) of Valencia, Spanish botanist and physician.

Performs well in a variety of soils including both clay and sandy loams.  Established plants have good drought tolerance.  Spreads, sometimes invasively, by self-seeding and rhizomes to form large colonies which choke out most other plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pennisetum macrourum, commonly called African feather grass, is a tender perennial grass that is native to southern Africa, tropical Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen).  It has been introduced in various other parts of the world.  Notwithstanding its ornamental beauty, it is noted for spreading invasively by rhizomes and self-seeding in parts of the southern U.S. and Australia.  This grass is included on the U.S. Noxious Weed List plus the regulated lists of several states (Alabama, California, Oregon, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Vermont).  This is a rapid-growing, clump-forming grass that produces upright, arching, narrow, linear green leaves growing in dense clumps to 3-4' tall with unbranched stems (culms) topped by cylindrical flower panicles which rise above the leaves to 5-6’ tall.  

Light green leaves (to 1/2” wide) grow from the base of the plant to 45” tall.  Leaf margins are sometimes purple-tinted.  Leaves consist of a leaf sheath which partially encloses the stem and a spreading linear blade.  Flowers appear in late spring and summer in erect or drooping, long, thin, cat-tail-like panicles (each to 4-16” long x 3/4” across) which are green or yellow green sometimes tinged with purple, yellow or brown.  Flower spikelets are surrounded by finely-barbed feathery bristles.  Flowers turn straw colored as they mature.Genus name comes from the Latin penna meaning feather and seta meaning bristle in reference to the flowers having long, feathery bristles.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macros meaning long and oura meaning tail in reference to the flower spikes.Common name refers to native territory (Africa) and feathery bristles on the flower heads.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Symphoricarpos albus, commonly called snowberry, is a bushy, rounded, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3-6' tall and as wide. It is native to dry rocky wooded slopes, banks and forests from Nova Scotia to British Columbia south to Oregon, New Mexico, Illinois and Virginia. Oblong-elliptic to rounded, dull green leaves (to 2"" long) produce little fall color. Tiny, bell-shaped, pink flowers (to 3/16"" long) bloom in clusters in the leaf axils in summer. Flowers are followed by clusters of globose berries (each to 1/2” diameter) that initially are pale green, but ripen to pure white by late summer to early autumn. Fruits remain attractive on the naked winter stems in large part because most birds do not find them appetizing.Genus name comes from the Greek symphorein meaning bear together and karpos meaning fruit in reference to the fruits appearing in clusters.Specific epithet means white for fruit color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Anthracnose, leaf spot, powdery mildew, rust and berry rot may occur.
","
Garden Uses
Shrub border, screen or hedge. Naturalize in open woodland areas. Because of suckering habit, plants may be useful for erosion control on slopes or banks.

Prefers organically rich, moist, slightly acidic soils with good drainage. Needs good air circulation. Good tolerance for urban conditions. To the extent practicable, promptly remove faded flower panicles before seed set. Prune as needed immediately after flowering. Best grown in cool summer climates, and not recommended for planting in the deep South below USDA Zone 7. Flower panicles appear on new growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Syringa villosa commonly called late lilac, is a rounded, deciduous shrub that grows to 10’ tall on upright stems clad with ovate to oblong, medium green leaves (to 7” long). It blooms several weeks later than common lilac (S. vulgaris), hence the common name. Showy, slightly fragrant, rose-lilac to white flowers bloom in dense, pyramidal panicles (to 8” long) in May. Flowers give way to loose clusters of brown capsules that persist into winter if not removed. No fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek word syrinx meaning tube or pipe in reference to the pith-filled but easily-hollowed stems of some genus plants.Specific epithet means covered with soft hairs.
","
Problems
Late lilac generally maintains good foliage throughout the growing season, with some resistance to powdery mildew. It is susceptible to a number of additional disease problems including blights, leaf spots, wilt and ring spot virus. Potential insect pests include scales, borers, leaf miners and caterpillars. Flower buds are susceptible to frost injury in early spring.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date or purchase plants in cell/six packs from local nurseries. Set plants out after last frost date. Plant taller varieties deep: strip off a few of the lower stem leaves and set plants below the remaining leaf scars so as to minimize the need for stem support. pinch young plants to promote bushy growth. Promptly deadhead spent flowers. Site tall varieties in locations sheltered from strong winds and heavy rains.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tagetes erecta, commonly called African marigold, Aztec marigold, American marigold or big marigold, is native to Mexico and Central America. Big marigold may be the best descriptive name because plants are noted for their large flowerheads. They typically grow from 1-4’ tall and feature huge, mostly double-globular flowers (2-4” diameter) in various shades of yellow, orange, and whitish. Pinnate leaves on glabrous, angular stems. Foliage and flowers are aromatic when brushed or crushed. Triploid F1 hybrids (T. erecta x T. patula) combine the large flowers of the African marigold with the more compact size of the French marigold into vigorous plants featuring 2-3” diameter flowers on stems rising 10-18” tall. These triploids seem unaffected by high summer heat and generally bloom throughout the summer.Genus named for an Etruscan deity, Tages.Specific epithet means erect or upright.
","
Problems
Susceptible to powdery mildew, Botrytis, leaf spot and rots. Taller varieties may need staking or other support. Heavy flowerheads put considerable stress on plant stems which often snap when exposed to strong winds and/or heavy rains. Watch for spider mites and thrips.

If not grafted or otherwise supported, the foliage of this weeping cultivar would simply sprawl along the ground as a ground cover.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Taxodium distichum, commonly called bald cypress, is a long-lived, pyramidal conifer (cone-bearing tree) which grows 50-70' tall (less frequently to 125'). Although it looks like a needled evergreen (same family as redwoods) in summer, it is deciduous (""bald"" as the common name suggests). It is native to southern swamps, bayous and rivers, primarily being found in coastal areas from Maryland to Texas and in the lower Mississippi River valley to as far north as the southeast corner of Missouri. In the deep South, it is a familiar sight growing directly in swampy water, often in large strands, with its branches heavily draped with Spanish moss. In cultivation, however, it grows very well in drier, upland soils. Trunks are buttressed (flared or fluted) at the base, and when growing in water, often develop distinctive, knobby root growths (""knees"") which protrude above the water surface around the tree. Soft, feathery, yellowish-green foliage (1/4"" long, flat needles in two ranks) turns an attractive orange/cinnamon-brown in fall. Rounded, wrinkled, 1 inch diameter, purplish-green cones mature to brown. Heavy, straight-grained, rot-resistant wood has been used for a variety of purposes including barrels, railroad ties and shingles. Closest relative is the dawn redwood (Metasequoia) which is also deciduous. State tree of Louisiana.Genus name comes from the Latin word Taxus meaning yew and the Greek word eidos meaning resemblance from a similarity of leaf shape.Specific epithet means is two ranks for the needle arrangement.‘Cascade Falls' is a compact weeping form that typically grows to 8-12' tall over the first 10-15 years, eventually maturing to as much as 20' tall. It was discovered growing on the bank of a lake on cultivated property in Albany, Auckland, New Zealand. Branches hang outward and then plunge vertically toward the ground. This cultivar does not produce viable seed. U.S. Plant Patent PP12,296 was issued on December 18, 2001.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, grow in containers or tubs that are overwintered indoors or as year-round houseplants. Container plants may be grown as shrubs or trained as ornamental standards. Plants generally grow best when overwintering period is short. Overwinter in a cool location (40s F.), such as a basement or garage, with moderate light and very little water or as a houseplant in a bright sunny but cool room with reduced water. Grows well in average, medium moisture soils in full sun to part shade. Thrives in rich, sandy soils. Container plants do best in fertile soils with good drainage. Water regularly but let plant soils dry out between waterings. Promptly deadhead spent blooms to prevent formation of non-ornamental seed pods. Cuttings may be taken in late summer. Prune lightly as needed to shape after flowering (late summer to fall).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cascabela thevetia, commonly called yellow oleander, is native to the West Indies, southern Mexico and Belize. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree that is in the same family as and closely related to Nerium oleander, commonly known as oleander. Primary differences between the two oleanders are: yellow oleander has yellow flowers and alternate leaves and oleander has pink or white flowers with leaves in whorls of three. Yellow oleander will grow to 20-30’ tall in its native habitat, but much shorter in the St. Louis area. It is an upright shrub that features willow-like, linear-lanceolate, glossy green leaves (to 6-7” long) with distinctive midribs and large 3” long funnel-shaped sometimes-fragrant yellow (less commonly apricot) flowers in few-flowered terminal clusters (cymes). Flowers bloom from summer to fall. Flowers give way to black seed pods, each containing 1-2 nut-like seeds. As with many of the dogbane family members, plant stems exude a milky sap when cut and all parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested. Plant saps can cause allergic skin reactions in some people. Smoke from burning plant material can also be toxic. May be trained as a standard. Seeds (1” diameter) are sometimes carried as talismen in the West Indies, where the shrubs are also commonly called lucky nut. 

Synonymous with Thevetia peruviana and Cascabela peruviana.Genus name comes from the Spanish word cascabela meaning small bell in reference to the shape of the flower.Specific epithet honors André Thevet (1502-1592) a French monk who traveled in Brazil and Guiana.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Prefers humusy, organically rich, moisture-retentive soils. Soil should not be allowed to dry out. Avoid wet soils which can be fatal particularly in winter. Removal of flower spikes after bloom will improve the appearance of the foliage mound. Foliage is semi-evergreen in the St. Louis area where the amount of retained foliage color in winter, if any, is in large part dependent upon the severity of the temperatures.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tiarella is a genus of about 7 species of herbaceous perennials from East Asia and North America. They make good ground covers in woodland gardens and shady borders.

Plants are in the same family as and somewhat suggestive of Heuchera, Tellima and Mitella. Tiarella is sometimes commonly called false miterwort because of its similarity to Mitella (miterwort).Genus name comes from the Greek tiara meaning a small crown in reference to the form of the fruit.‘Black Velvet’ is a clump-forming foamflower hybrid which is noted for its attractive foliage and its spires of pinkish-white flowers in spring. Plant parents are T. ‘Pinwheel’ (female/seed parent) and Tiarella Seedling 97-63 (male/pollen parent). It forms a basal foliage mound of lobed, deeply cut, dark green leaves with black center blotches and black striping along the lobe veins. Foliage mound typically grows 10-14” tall and 15” wide. Tiny white flowers tinged with pink bloom in spring in bottle-brush-like racemes atop erect, wiry, mostly leafless stems which rise above the foliage mound to a height of 19”. Flowers have a very faint fragrance.  U.S. Plant Patent PP12,348 issued January 8, 2002.

Culture
Annual best grown in consistently moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Although sometimes classified as a warm weather annual, this species of Torenia is not terribly fond of hot and humid summer weather. In the St. Louis area, it needs protection from the hot afternoon sun and benefits from a summer mulch to help retain moisture and keep soils cool. As long as properly sited and watered, it will generally bloom from early/mid summer to frost. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date or sow seed directly in the garden just before last frost date. Plants are often available from nurseries in cell/six packs. Set out seedlings or purchased plants 1-2 weeks after last frost date. Young plants may be pinched to promote compact, bushier growth. Container plants may be brought indoors for winter bloom.

Culture
In a protected location, this windmill palm is considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 7. It is not reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area where it may not survive harsh winters. It is typically grown in organically rich, moderately fertile, evenly moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best performance is in part shade. Site in protected locations that are sheltered from winter winds. Mature plants will usually survive 10 degree F. temperatures in winter (sometime colder). Of the arborescent (trunked) palms, windmill palm has the best winter hardiness. Of the non-arborescent (trunkless) palms, Rhapidophyllum hystrix and Sabal minor have slightly better winter hardiness. Plant crown may need protection (e.g. plastic sheet) when temperatures head toward single digits. Mulch around the base of the plant in winter. Plants may be propagated by seed, but male and female plants are required for seed production to occur.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Trachycarpus fortunei, commonly called windmill palm, is native to subtropical and temperate mountain forests of China where it typically grows to 20-40’ (sometimes to 60’) tall with a solitary trunk densely covered with hair-like fibers from old leaf sheaths. From the top of the trunk, large palmate fan-shaped dark green leaves (to 3’ wide) push outward in all directions on 2-3’ long petioles in a form purportedly resembling a windmill. Leaves are segmented about half way, with the segment tips often drooping. In cultivation in cold winter areas of USDA Zones 6-7, windmill palm will typically grow at most to 8-10’ tall. For a palm, it has excellent winter hardiness. Attractive yellowish flowers in drooping panicles (to 2’ long) bloom in summer. Female flowers (plants are dioecious) give way to dark blue drupes. In China, fibers from the trunks of mature trees are stripped for weaving into a decorative hemp-like rope or for making brooms, mats or cloth. Genus name is from Greek meaning rough (trachy) and fruit (carpus) in probable reference to fruit appearance.Genus name comes from the Greek words trachys meaning rough and karpos meaning a fruit in reference to the fruit of some species.Specific epithet honors Robert Fortune (1812-1880), Scottish horticulturist.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, acidic, humusy soils. Tolerant of wet, boggy soils. Deadhead each flower cluster after all buds in the cluster have opened to extend the bloom period. As the heat of the summer sets in, foliage tends to decline considerably and flowering slows down or stops entirely, at which point plants should be cut back hard. Cutting back plants almost to the ground will promote both new foliage growth and an additional late summer to fall bloom. Divide clumps when they become overcrowded.It is expected that the foliage of ‘Blushing Bride‘ will retain its best variegated color in part shade locations. Plant leaves may turn entirely green over time in full sun exposures.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tradescantia, commonly called spiderworts, is a genus of about 65 species of herbaceous perennials from North, Central and South America. They are grown for their showy flowers or attractive foliage. Andersoniana Group includes hybrids of T. virginiana, T. subaspera and T. ohiensis.Genus name honors John Tradescant (1570-1638) and his son John Tradescant (1608-1662), botanists and successive gardeners to Charles I of England.When the stems of spiderworts are cut, a viscous stem secretion is released which becomes thread-like and silky upon hardening (like a spider’s web), hence the common name.‘Blushing Bride’ is a clump-forming, hybrid spiderwort that is noted for its unique variegated foliage. It typically grows to 12-18” tall. Dayflower-like green foliage emerges in spring with pink blotches at the base of each leaf. The pink blotches turn white as the plants mature providing interesting variegated leaves. Three-petaled, white flowers (to 1.5” diameter) accented by contrasting yellow stamens are borne in terminal clusters (umbels) atop stiff stems. Numerous flower buds form in each cluster, but individual flowers open up only a few at at time, each for only one day, blooming in succession from May into summer.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Young shoots are susceptible to damage from snails and caterpillars. Spiderwort foliage often sprawls in an unattractive manner by mid-summer.

Culture
Grow in poor to average, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants have some tolerance for dry soils. Best performance occurs in cool summer areas. Some part afternoon shade is appreciated in hot summer areas where plants will be stressed by prolonged stretches of high temperatures. Avoid fertilization which tends to increase foliage output but decrease flower production. By reputation, nasturtiums are easy-to-grow annuals that are tolerant of a certain amount of neglect. Sow seed directly in the garden near last spring frost date, or in pots about 4-6 weeks prior to last spring frost date. Propagate by cuttings or by seed. Plants will self seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Nasturtiums are warm weather annuals that have been popular in herb gardens, cottage gardens and flower gardens for many years. Cultivars and hybrids sold under the name of Tropaeolum majus are generally referred to as common nasturtiums or garden nasturtiums. These plants feature showy, long-stalked, spurred, funnel-shaped, 5-petaled flowers (to 2.5” wide) in shades of red, orange, yellow and cream. Flowers have a spicy fragrance. Flowers bloom from spring to fall. Rounded, long-petioled, parasol-like leaves of these plants are peltate (petioles attached near the center of each leaf). These plants appear as climbing types (to 6-10’) and as dwarf-bushy sprawling types (to 1’ tall and 2’ wide).Genus name comes from the Greek word tropaion meaning a trophy and the Latin word tropaeum named by Linnaeus for its resemblance to a classical trophy.Current dwarf-bushy varieties include Alaska Series (to 12” tall with white spotted leaves), Gleam Series (semi-trailing to 18” tall with semi-double flowers), Jewel Series (dwarf-bushy to 12” tall with semi-double and double flowers), Tom Thumb Series (dwarf-bushy to 10” tall with single flowers) and Whirlybird Series (dwarf-bushy to 10” tall with spurless single to semi-double flowers). ‘Jewel of Africa’ climbs to 8’ tall with single flowers and white spotted leaves.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tsuga canadensis, commonly called Canadian hemlock or eastern hemlock, is a dense, pyramidal conifer of the pine family that is native to moist woods, moist slopes, rocky hillsides/ridges, wooded ravines, and stream valleys from eastern Canada south to Maine and Wisconsin and further south in the Appalachian Mountains to Georgia and Alabama.  It grows to 40-75’ tall in the wild.  This species is noted for having the smallest needles and cones in the genus.  Flat sprays of lacy evergreen foliage give this tree a graceful form.  Short dark green needles (to 9/16"" long) with two white bands beneath are arranged in two opposite rows.  Needles are attached to twigs by slender stalks.  Small, pendant, short-stalked, seed-bearing cones (to 3/4"" long) are tan-brown.  Lower branches often dip toward the ground.  Thick and ridged bark on mature trees is red-brown to gray-brown.  State tree of Pennsylvania.  No part of this tree is poisonous.  The poisonous hemlocks (Circuta maculata and Conium maculatum) are herbaceous perennials in the parsley family.Genus name of Tsuga is derived from the Japanese name for trees in this genus.Specific epithet means native in part to Canada.
","
Problems
A healthy plant in the proper environment has few problems.  Potential disease problems for plants in the genus Tusga include needle blight (needles turn yellow and die), canker, rusts and rots.  Potential insect problems include bagworms, borers, leaf miner, saw fly and spider mites.  Foliage may scorch in very hot weather.  Prolonged drought can be fatal.  

Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is a tiny (1/32”) sap-sucking insect (relative of the aphid) that has recently become a serious threat to the survival of native hemlocks in the wild in the eastern United States.  HWA was accidentally introduced into the U. S. in the 1920s from Eastern Asia.  It has been known to exist in the Pacific Northwest since 1927, but was first observed in the forests of Virginia in the 1950s.  It has now spread from Virginia into the southern and middle Appalachians.  Inability to survive cold winters has so far substantially limited HWA’s northern spread to as far as Massachusetts, but northward expansion into much of New England is expected as winter temperatures continue to moderate.  HWA has killed most of the old growth hemlocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and 95% of the hemlocks in Shenandoah National Park.  HWA was discovered in Pennsylvania’s Allegheny National Park in November of 2013.   Treatment of HWA is available (pesticides containing imidacloprid or dinotefuran), but control of this pest is very difficult.

Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Site in locations protected from hot afternoon sun.  Prefers cool, moist conditions in part shade.  Intolerant of drought and should be watered regularly in prolonged dry spells, particularly when plants are young.  Best growth occurs in a moisture-laden atmosphere in temperatures that are cooler than those found in the eastern U.S.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Tsuga heterophylla, commonly known as western hemlock, is a pyramidal needled evergreen tree of the pine family.  It features a narrow pyramidal crown that typically grows in cultivation to 70-150’ but may soar to as much as 250’ tall in the wild.  It is the largest of the hemlock trees.  It is native from Southern Alaska south through British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and those parts of northern California which are west of the Cascade Mountains plus in the northern Rocky Mountains in Canada and the northern U.S.  Trees typically do not perform well outside of their native range.  Needles (1/4” to 3/4” long and to 1/16” wide) are shiny dark green with white rows beneath.  Cones grow to 1 1/8” long, and are pendulous (hang from the branch tips).  Reddish-brown bark is up to 1.5” thick and develops deep scaly ridges.  This species is the state tree of the State of Washington.Genus name of Tsuga is derived from the Japanese name for trees in this genus.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words heteros meaning different and phyllon meaning leaf.‘Thorsen’s Weeping’, by contrast, is a dwarf, prostrate, ground cover version of this tree.  It features emerald green foliage and procumbent branches.  It can sprawl along the ground as a ground cover to only 4” tall and to 5’ across over the first 5 years.  If staked or otherwise supported to a desired height, it can grow over time in a cascading mound to the desired height, typically 3-5’ tall, with gracefully weeping branches which sweep to the ground.
","
Problems
A healthy plant in the proper environment has few problems.  Potential disease problems for plants in the genus Tusga include needle blight (needles turn yellow and die), canker, rusts and rots.  Potential insect problems include bagworms, borers, leaf miner, saw fly and spider mites.  Woody adelgid (an aphid) is particularly troublesome in the Northeast where it can be fatal (has spread significantly since the 1950s).  Foliage may scorch in very hot weather.  Plants are generally intolerant of urban pollution.

Culture
Grow in medium moisture, moderately fertile, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers full sun in cool summer climates, but appreciates some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Tolerant of some drought once established. Plant corms in spring after last frost date approximately 3-4” deep and 6” apart. These plants may not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they will benefit from being sited in protected locations (e.g., near the south side of a house) and mulched in winter. Corms may be lifted in fall, dried and stored for winter in a dry medium in a cool but frost-free location.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crocosmia is a genus of about 7 species of cormous plants from grasslands in South Africa. Montbretias are good fresh cut flowers that are frequently used in commercial flower arrangements.

Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora is an interspecific hybrid resulting from a cross between C. aurea and C. pottsii.Genus name comes from the Greek words krokos meaning saffron and osme meaning a smell for the smell of dried flowers steeped in warm water.Specific epithet means Crocosmia-flowered.'Buttercup' is a compact, clump-forming cultivar that can reach up to 2.5' tall and spread to fill a 3' area. Can reach larger spreads in ideal growing conditions. The luminous, buttercup-yellow, tubular flowers (up to 1.5"" in diameter) are held on unbranched flowering stalks above the upright, sword-like foliage. Blooms from mid-summer into fall. Very attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators. This selection also makes an excellent cut flower with a long vase life.
","
Problems
Spider mites can cause significant damage to the foliage, and, if left unchecked, can impair normal flowering. Winter hardiness is a concern in the St. Louis area. Deer and rabbits tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses
Perennial borders in groupings or masses. Also effective in containers where lifting corms for winter is rather simple.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerant of light shade. Prefers rich, moist loams. Adapts to both wet and dry sites. Generally tolerant of urban conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ulmus americana, commonly called American elm, is a medium to large deciduous tree, typically growing to 60-80’ (less frequently to 130’) tall with a vase-shaped, broad-rounded crown. It is native to eastern and central North America. In Missouri, it typically occurs in low moist ground and along streams throughout the state (Steyermark). Although once widely planted as a street and lawn tree, American elm populations have been so decimated by Dutch elm disease that this tree is no longer considered to be a viable selection for landscape uses. Insignificant small green flowers appear in spring before the foliage emerges. Flowers give way to single-seeded wafer-like samaras (each tiny seed is surrounded by a flattened oval-rounded papery wing). Seeds mature in April-May as the leaves reach full size. Rough-textured, ovate-elliptic, dark green leaves (to 6” long) have toothed margins and asymetrical bases. Leaves typically turn an undistinguished yellow in fall.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means of North or South America.
","
Problems
Dutch elm disease, a fatal fungal disease spread by airborne bark beetles, attacks the water-conducting tissue of the tree, resulting in wilting, defoliation and death. Phloem necrosis is a disease caused by a phytoplasma that attacks the food-conducting tissue of the tree, usually resulting in a loosening of the bark, wilting, defoliation and death. Wetwood is a bacterial disease that results in wilting and dieback. Various wilts, rots, cankers and leaf spots may also occur. Insect visitors include borers, leaf miner, beetles, mealy bugs, caterpillars and scale.Development of varieties that are resistant to Dutch elm disease is ongoing.
","
Garden Uses
May be used as a lawn, shade or street tree. Not currently recommended for most landscape plantings due to Dutch elm disease. Disease resistant varieties such as Ulmus americana ‘Valley Forge’ are promising but not totally immune.

Culture
Best grown in acidic (pH of 4.8 to 5.2), peaty, organically rich, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.   Shallow, fibrous roots need constant moisture and good drainage.  Plants appreciate a good organic mulch.  Although blueberries are self-fertile, cross-pollination produces the best fruit crop (larger berries and larger yields).  Therefore, it is best to plant more than one variety that will bloom at the same time.  In addition, blueberry season can be extended by planting early, mid-season and late varieties which will collectively ripen from early June to the end of the summer (St. Louis area).  Best to remove flowers from plants in the year of planting and in the following year so as to prevent fruit set and to encourage new vegetative growth.  Prune as needed in late winter beginning in the third year after planting.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Vaccinium is a genus of about 450 species. Some species and hybrids, including blueberries, cranberries and huckleberries are grown primarily for their fruit.Genus name comes from an ancient Latin name apparently derived from a prehistoric Mediterranean language.‘Blue Jay’ is a variety that usually grows to 5-7’ tall, but may be pruned shorter. Dainty, waxy, bell-shaped, white flowers appear in May. Flowers are followed by medium-sized, light blue blueberries that ripen in mid season (June). Ovate, medium green leaves (to 3.5” long) turn attractive shades of yellow-orange to red and purple in fall. Reddish stems can be attractive in winter.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Birds love the fruit, so plants may need to be covered with netting as the fruit begins to ripen in order to protect the crop.  Chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) may occur in high pH soils.  Potential but infrequent disease problems include stem blight, root rot, anthracnose, cane cankers, mildew and botrytis.  Blueberry maggot and cherry fruit worm may attack the fruit.  Mummy berry is a fungal disease that causes the berries to shrivel and drop.  Disease problems are sometimes of lesser concern when plants are being primarily grown as ornamentals.
","
Garden Uses
Useful for ornamental purposes (flowers, fruit, quality summer foliage and fall color) as well as for fruit production (blueberries).  It is effective in shrub borders or as part of less formal shrub plantings in areas such as native plant gardens or open woodlands.  Particularly effective in conjunction with rhododendrons and azaleas which share similar acidic soil requirements.  Also makes an excellent low hedge with the added benefits of fruit which can be harvested or left for the birds.

Culture
Best grown in evenly moist, well-drained loams (e.g., sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade. Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun. Plants can grow in close to full shade, but typically are less vigorous and more open with decreased foliage density. When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to scorch, bronze in winter or suffer from mite attacks. Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline. Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing. Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date. Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots. Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2”). Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation. Boxwood is best sited in locations sheltered from strong winds, with, if possible, some protection from full winter sun. Foliage may bronze in winter when exposed to half day to full day sun. Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing. Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus is a genus of about 70 species of evegreen shrubs and trees from Europe, Asia, Africa and Central America.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood to make boxes. Another theory on common name is that boxwood describes the quadrangular (square box cross section) stems of young plants.'Cranberry Creek' was introduced by Willoway Nurseries of Ohio and is named for the creek near where the plant was found. It has a dense compact habit with a pyramidal shape that grows low to the ground and a fine texture with small round emerald green leaves. It grows 3 to 4 ft. in height and spread, although this may vary. 'Cranberry Creek' has insignificant flowers and fruit.
","
Problems
Boxwood can be somewhat temperamental to grow in the St. Louis area where its evergreen foliage tends to bronze (turn unattractive brownish-yellow) in harsh winters, particularly if plants are located in open areas exposed to full sun and winter winds. Otherwise, boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning. No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot. Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils. The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid. In the deep South, nematodes are of concern. New growth is particularly susceptible to winter damage.

Freely self-seeds in optimum growing conditions to the point of being somewhat invasive and weedy.  Promptly remove (shear if large planting) spent flower stems to encourage additional bloom and to prevent seeds from forming.   Plants are generally less vigorous in the hot and humid summers of the Southeastern U.S. than in cool summer climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centranthus ruber, commonly called red valerian or Jupiter’s beard, is a well-branched, bushy, clump-forming, woody-based perennial which is valued for its ability to produce, often in poor soils, a showy bloom of star-shaped crimson, pink or white flowers from spring to frost.  Although native to the Mediterranean, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the United States, particularly along the west coast.  Flowers (each to 1/2"") appear in dense terminal clusters (cymes) atop upright to relaxed stems rising above the foliage to 1.5-3' tall.  Flowers are fragrant.  If not deadheaded, flowers give way to dandelion-like seed heads which are typically disbursed around the landscape by wind.  Fleshy, sessile, oval to lanceolate leaves (to 4"" long) are gray-green.Genus name comes from the Greek words kentron meaning a spur and anthos meaning a flower for the spurred flower.Specific epithet means red in reference to flower color of species plants.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Vernonia noveboracensis, commonly called ironweed or New York ironweed, is a tall, coarse, upright perennial which typically occurs in the wild in moist thickets, low areas and along streambanks from Massachusetts to Mississippi. Features numerous tiny, fluffy, deep purple, composite flowers (rays absent) in loose, 3-4"" wide, terminal clusters (cymes) atop stiff, leafy stems typically growing 4-6' tall. Somewhat suggestive of Joe Pye weed, except leaves of ironweed are alternate. Blooms late summer into fall. Rough, pointed, serrate, lance-shaped leaves (6-8"" long). Flowers give way to rusty seed clusters. The source of the common name has been varyingly attributed to certain ""iron-like"" plant qualities including the tough stems, the rusty-tinged color of fading flowers and the rusty colored seeds.Genus name honors William Vernon (d. c. 1711), English botanist who collected in Maryland in 1698.Specific epithet means of New York.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Veronicastrum sibiricum, commonly known as Culver’s root, is a large, upright, rhizomatous perennial of the figwort family that is native to grassy slopes and thickets in China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Russia (Siberia).  This plant produces several upright leaf stalks (each rising to 3-5’ tall) clad with horizontal whorls of oblong to broadly linear, sharply-toothed, short-petioled, serrate-margined, gray-green leaves (each leaf to 6” long and to  2” wide).  Each whorl typically has 4-6 leaves.  Leaves have a coarser texture than the leaves on Veronicastrum virginicum.  Leaf stalks are topped by slender, tapered, candelabra-like, terminal spikes (to 8” long) of lavender-lilac salverform flowers which bloom in late summer to early fall (July-September).  Each flower has a long slender tube and 4-5 short lobes.  This plant resembles a tall veronica and was once included in the genus Veronica.  Veronicastrum has leaves in whorls and corollas with tubes that are much longer than the lobes, whereas Veronica has opposite leaves and corollas with tubes shorter than the lobes.Genus name comes from the genus name Veronica (Christian legend claims Saint Veronica gave her veil to Christ to wipe his forehead while he was carrying the cross to Calvary) and astrum meaning star or incomplete resemblance.Specific epithet is in reference to this plant being in part native to Siberia.The origin of Culver’s root is uncertain, but may refer to an early American physician from the late 17th to early 18th century (Dr. Culver or Dr. Coulvert) who reportedly used the U.S. species Veronicastrum virginicum in his practice for its laxative properties.

Flowers are followed by clusters of red berry-like drupes which ripen black. Fruit is not particularly showy. Ovate, grayish-green leaves (to 4"" long) turn reddish-maroon in fall. This hybrid is a cross between V. carlesii and V. macrocephalum var. keteleeri.Genus name comes from the Latin name of a species plant.Specific epithet is a combination of the specific epithets of the two parents.‘Cayuga’ was registered and released into commerce by The United States National Arboretum in 1966. It is a backcross of V. carlesii x V. x carlcephalum. It is particularly noted for its compact habit, abundant snowball inflorescences and dark green foliage. This is a moderately compact, deciduous shrub with spreading branches that typically grows 4-6’ tall, but over time will mature to as much as 8’ tall and 11’ wide. Pink buds give way to mildly fragrant, white waxy flowers in snowball inflorescences (cymes to 4” diameter) that bloom profusely in late April to May. Buds and open flowers are often seen simultaneously on the same inflorescence. Leves turn orange-red (sometimes undistinguished) in fall.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Viburnum plicatum is a dense, upright, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that typically matures to 8-15’ tall with a slightly larger spread.  Ovate, toothed, strongly-veined, dark green leaves (to 4” long) have pleated upper surfaces.  Leaves turn burgundy red to purplish red in fall.  Two different forms of this shrub are commonly sold in commerce:  (1) Japanese snowball bush (f. plicatum) which is the type form featuring sterile, snowball-like, orbicular inflorescences (2-3” diameter cymes) of non-fragrant, showy white flowers along the branches in spring with no subsequent fruit and  (b) doublefile viburnum (f. tomentosum) which is the wild-related taxon featuring fertile, flat-topped flower clusters (2-4” diameter cymes) which bloom along tiered horizontal branches in doublefile form, each cluster containing an outer ring of large showy sterile florets surrounding a center mass of tiny non-showy fertile florets which when fertilized give way to egg-shaped fruits and viable seed.  Bloom time of f. plicatum typically occurs about two weeks later than that of f. tomentosum.  Mature height of f. plicatum may rise to as much as 15’ tall, but mature height of f. tomentosum typically will not exceed 10’ tall.  Except as to flower structure, bloom time, height and branching habit, both forms are otherwise very similar and commonly sold in commerce under a number of different cultivar names.      

The sterile snowball form (f. plicatum) is known from cultivation only (first observed as a garden plant in Japan).  It was discovered prior in time to the discovery of the wild fertile doublefile form (f. tomentosum) from which it was actually developed.  As a result of this inverted schedule of discovery, the sterile form was mistakenly given a species name (Viburnum plicatum) and the subsequently discovered fertile form (f. tomentosum) was named as if it were a variety of the species.  The wild form (f. tomentosum) is native to forests and thickets in China and Japan.Genus name comes from the Latin name of a species plant.Specific epithet means pleated or folded in reference to deep leaf veins.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-12.  Relatively easy to grow from seed.  Needs a support structure on which to grow.  Performs best in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Once this vine has matured to cover the area it is meant to cover, cut back the leaves and tendrils to trigger the onset of significant flowering.  This vine can aggressively self-seed in warm tropical areas.  It may be grown in pots in northern climates which are brought indoors for overwintering to a sunny window.  May be grown as an annual.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Vigna caracalla, commonly called corkscrew vine, corkscrew flower or snail flower, is a rapid-growing twining perennial vine in the pea family that is native to tropical areas of Central and South America.  It is evergreen in frost free climates.  It is noted for producing an ornamentally attractive July to October bloom of white and lilac-purple (sometimes marked with yellow and cream) spirally twisted flowers (each to 2” long) on erect racemes to 12” long.  Flowers curl in a manner somewhat reminiscent of a snail’s shell.  Vines are clad with 3-palmate green leaves (each leaf having three leaflets to 3-5” long).  This vine typically matures to 12-20’ (occasionally to 30’).  Each flower has a unique structure consisting of a broad-oval backward-curled upper petal (the standard) plus two coiled, fused and elongated central petals (the keel) and two side petals (the wings).  Flowers are highly fragrant.  Blooms occur mid-summer to frost.  Flowers are followed by slender, dangling, bean-like pods (6-7” long and 1” wide) which contain rounded brown seeds.  Flowers are mostly pollinated by ants.  

Corkscrew vine has naturalized, sometimes spreading aggressively, in parts of California. 

Flowers spirally twist on the vine in a manner suggestive of a corkscrew, hence the common name of corkscrew vine.Genus name honors Dominicus Vigna (1581-1647), Italian scientist/professor and botanist.Specific epithet honors Caracas, Venezuela which is part of the native habitat of this plant.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Catharanthus roseus, commonly called periwinkle, Madagascar periwinkle or annual vinca, is an erect to spreading tender perennial in the dogbane family typically mounding 6-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall and as wide. It produces attractive bushy foliage that is covered by an often profuse bloom of phlox-like flowers from summer to frost. Best flowering is in summer. Tubular flowers have five flattened petal-like lobes and appear singly in the upper leaf axils. Species flowers are rosy-pink to red with mauve throats. However, species plants are seldom seen in commerce today, having been largely replaced by larger flowered cultivars, many of which are dwarf to compact plants that sometimes have overlapping petals. Cultivars expand the available color range to include pale pink, rose, hot pink, red, lilac, and white, often with contrasting darker throats/eyes. Oblong to ovate glossy green leaves (to 2” long). Synonymous with and formerly know as Vinca rosea.Specific epithet means rose colored.

Culture
Best grown in slightly acidic, humusy, moderately fertile, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Full sun is needed for best flowering. Although vines may produce flowers by the second or third year after planting, first flowering may take longer. Vines need regular pruning(s) in order to control size and shape of the plant and to encourage flowering. Consult a pruning guide for specifics on the initial training of vines and the types of pruning that can or should be done for these plants. An application of fertilizer in early spring can also help stimulate flowering. Choose growing sites wisely because plants dislike being transplanted.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Wisteria frutescens, commonly called American wisteria, is a counterclockwise twining deciduous woody vine that grows to 40’ or more. It is native primarily to moist thickets, swampy woods, pond peripheries and stream borders from Virginia to Illinois south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, Wisteria frutescens var. macrostachya is found in the far southeastern bootheel area. Fragrant, pea-like, lilac-purple flowers in drooping racemes to 6” long bloom in April-May after the leaves emerge but before they fully develop. Limited additional summer bloom may occur. Flowers give way to narrow, flattened, smooth seed pods (to 5” long) which ripen in summer. Pods typically split open in fall. Compound, odd-pinnate leaves (each leaf typically with 9-15 lance-shaped leaflets) are deep green. American wisteria is not as aggressive a spreader as Wisteria sinensis (Chinese wisteria). Both Wisteria frutescens  (American wisteria) and Wisteria sinensis (Chinese wisteria) twine in a counterclockwise direction but Wisteria floribunda (Japanese wisteria) twines clockwise.Genus name honors Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania.Specific epithet means shrubby or woody.
","
Problems
Although susceptible to a number of foliage-chewing insects and fungal diseases, none are significant. Failure of vines to produce flowers may be attributable to a number of causes including death of flower buds in winter, too much shade, plants too young (especially seed grown ones), improper pruning or overfertilization.

Spreads by branching and creeping rhizomes, and will naturalize over time into large colonies in optimum growing conditions... almost to the point of being weedy.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Woodwardia areolata, commonly called netted chain fern, is a deciduous fern of eastern North America which typically occurs in woodland swamps and bogs. Although native to Missouri, it is considered rare in the State and is known to exist in only four southern counties. Features pinnatifid, glossy green sterile fronds which emerge pinkish in spring and unroll to 1-2' long. Sterile fronds typically have 8-10 pairs of lance-shaped pinnae (leaflets) with small marginal teeth. Fertile fronds arise in summer to the same length as the sterile ones, but have narrower leaf divisions. The pinnae of both fronds have netted veins and the sori (spores) on the fertile fronds are arranged in chain-like rows parallel to the pinnae midribs, hence the common name. This fern is similar in appearance to the much more common sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis), except the latter generally grows taller (to 4'), has beaded, woody-like fertile fronds and has smooth-edged leaflets on the sterile fronds.Genus name honors English botanist Thomas Jenkinson Woodward (1745-1820).Specific epithet means marked out in small areas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Zelkova serrata, commonly called Japanese zelkova, is a medium to large deciduous tree, typically growing to 50-80’ tall with a spreading, generally upward-branching, vase-shaped crown. It is native to Japan, Taiwan and eastern China. It is noted for its graceful shape, clean foliage, attractive bark and resistance to Dutch elm disease. Zelkova has in fact been promoted in recent years as a substitute for American elm (Ulmus americana) because of its resistance to Dutch elm disease. Insignificant small green flowers appear in spring as the foliage emerges. Flowers give way to small, non-showy, ovate, wingless drupes that ripen in autumn. Oblong-elliptic medium green leaves (to 3” long) with coarse, ciliate marginal teeth and acuminate tips. Fall color is variable, ranging from undistinguished yellow to attractive shades of yellow-orange to red-brown. Smooth gray bark in youth exfoliates with age to reveal orange-brown inner bark. Zelkova is valued as a commercial timber tree in Japan.Genus name may refer to the original Republic of Georgia name (Zelkova carpinifolia is native to the Caucasus).Specific epithet and additional common name of sawleaf zelkova both refer to the serrated leaf margins.
