 Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Grows well in sandy loams. May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range. New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist. Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool. Site in locations protected from strong winds. Avoid hot and dry sites. Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge. Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter. Spring or summer pruning often results in significant bleeding.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall. It is native to Japan, Korea and China. General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching. Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes. Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April). The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance. Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs. Samaras ripen in September-October. Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze. Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.","Problems
 Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots. Potential insect pests include aphids, scale, borers and root weevils.

 Aesculus pavia, commonly called red buckeye, is a deciduous clump-forming shrub or small tree with an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows 10-20’ tall. Showy, erect, 4-10” long panicles of red to orange-red, narrow-tubular flowers appear in spring. Palmately compound, shiny, dark green leaves are attractive in spring and early summer, but usually begin to decline by August. Smooth, light brown, globular (1-2” diameter) seed capsules encase 1-3 shiny seeds called buckeyes that ripen in the fall. Seeds are poisonous and are avoided by most wildlife. Fall foliage color is unremarkable. Red buckeye is native to southeastern Missouri where it typically occurs in low rich wooded valleys, at bluff bases, on wooded slopes and along streams (Steyermark). Flowers are attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds and bloom in St. Louis at about the same time that the hummingbirds return to the area in spring migration.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet honors 17th century Dutch botanist Peter Paaw (Petrus Pavius).","Problems

 Abelia chinensis, commonly known as Chinese abelia, is an upright-rounded, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub of the honeysuckle family that typically grows on arching branches to 5-8’ tall and to 3-5’ wide. This is an outstanding flowering shrub whose main claim to fame is a lengthy early summer to fall bloom of very fragrant tubular white flowers with showy soft pink bracts. Flowers may be the most fragrant found on any species of Abelia. This shrub is native to lower alpine areas up to about 6000’ in elevation in southeastern China. Branchlets are covered with soft reddish wooly hairs when young. Mature branches are grayish brown. Toothed ovate leaves (to 1 1/2” long) are sparsely hairy above. White flowers (each to 1/2” long) bloom in axillary and terminal clusters at the stem ends. Weight of the flowers often causes the stem ends to dip, thus giving the shrub a somewhat weeping appearance during peak bloom season. As the flowers finish bloom, the sepals turn from green to a showy rosy mauve and persist on the shrub with retention of that color until November. From a distance, the shrub appears to be in bloom well into fall even though the flowers are long gone. This shrub is well-known for being attractive to butterflies (adults butterflies seek flower nectar and caterpillars feed on the foliage). 
 

 Chinese abelia is a parent of the popular A. x grandiflora hybrids.Genus name honors Dr. Clarke Abel (1780-1826), physician and naturalist, who collected seed and plants as part of a British expedition to China in 1817.Specific epithet is in reference to this species being native to China.","Problems

 Agave parryi, often called Parry's agave or mescal, is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to grasslands, chaparral, desert scrub, pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands in Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico typically at elevations from 4,000 to 8,000 feet. It is most noted for its attractive blue-gray to gray-green evergreen leaves, but is also noted for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes. Thick, rigid, smooth, ovate to oblong, blue-gray leaves (to 12” long) form a large, dense, symmetrical, basal rosette. A rosette will typically mature over time to 2' tall by 3' wide. Each leaf has spiny margins with a one inch terminal spine. Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes. Each rosette will flower only once, usually at some point between 10-15 years (not the 100 years suggested by the also-used common name of century plant used for some agaves), but sometimes flowering will not occur until 20-30 years. One huge flowering stalk (to 20' tall) will rise from each rosette, with each stalk producing 20 to 30 side branches and with each side branch containing a large cluster of creamy yellow flowers. In its native habitat, flowers typically bloom in summer (June - August). Flowers are followed by seed pods. The flowering rosette dies after flowering, but new rosettes formed by suckers/offsets from the base of the mother plant will remain. Native Americans used this agave as a source of food, fiber, soap and medicine. Plant liquids may be fermented to form an alcoholic beverage called pulque which may be further distilled to form mescal or tequila.  
 

 Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable in probable reference to the flower spikes.  
 

 Specific epithet honors Charles C. Parry (1823-1890), physician-botanist-plant collector.","Problems

Best sited in full sun, but this plant seems to adapt to some part shade. It needs bright light for flowering. Tolerant of drought and dry indoor air. Water very moderately in spring, summer and fall, but reduce watering to the minimum in winter. Tolerates 50F to 60F degree nights in summer with a minimum of 40F degrees in winter. Plants taken outside for summer should be protected from rain, and should be brought indoors in early fall before night temperatures begin to dip below 50F degrees. Easily propagated from offsets that appear near the base of mature plants.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Aloe vera, commonly called medicinal aloe, is a stoloniferous, stemless, tropical perennial that grows upright with stiff rosettes of succulent leaves. Common name is in reference to the folk medicine history of this plant which goes back to the pre-Christian era. Lance-shaped green leaves (to 18” long) are spotted white and armed with whitish marginal teeth. Leaves mature to gray-green. Plants may grow to as much as 3’ tall. Flowering occurs only on mature plants, typically in summer. On container plants, flowering will only occur on plants grown in optimum conditions (e.g., sunny windows or sunny outdoor locations). Yellow flowers in racemes bloom atop erect stalks rising to as much as 3’ tall. Medicinal aloe is noted for the healing and cosmetic properties attributed to its sap. The sap is added to a large number of commercial cosmetics, particularly lotions and creams. Sap is noted for its ability to moisten dry skin. Sap from a broken leaf may be applied directly to burns on the skin for relief. Sap should not be eaten, but has been used in the past for treating peptic ulcers. The sap also reportedly has strong laxative properties. Medicinal aloe is also commonly called burn plant or burn aloe. Synonymous with and formerly known as Aloe barbadensis.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. Plants can be grown outdoors year round as long as temperatures never dip below 20-25 degrees F. Plants perform best in organically rich, consistently moist but well drained soils in part shade (bright indirect light or filtered sun). Avoid direct hot afternoon sun which may cause the leaves to yellow. Tolerates full shade, but foliage may turn a lighter green. Plants may die to the ground in light freezes, but roots remain hardy to about 20-25 degrees F. North of Zone 9, plants can be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors. Asparagus fern is easily grown as a houseplant in the St. Louis area because it tolerates a wide range of temperatures, does not require high humidity and is easily pruned. It is best grown with a well-drained, peaty potting mixture. Water regularly from spring to autumn. It does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering over the winter months. Performs well with regular temperatures in summer and minimum 50F temperatures in winter. This plant is often taken outside for the growing season and brought back inside in early fall. Pinch back stem tips as needed to maintain plant form and promote dense foliage growth. If plant loses its attractive shape, stems may be cut back close to the soil level to regenerate. Propagate by seed or division (separate tubers). Birds eat the berries and help spread the seed to new locations where the seed will often readily sprout. Self-seeding can be mildly invasive in some subtropical to tropical areas (e.g., southern Florida and Hawaii).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Asparagus densiflorus, commonly called asparagus fern, is noted for its dense fern-like foliage which forms an arching mound that matures to 1-3’ tall spreading to 3-4’ wide. It is not a fern, however, but is a member of the asparagus family. It is native primarily to coastal areas in the southeastern part of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. It has escaped cultivation and naturalized in southern Florida where it has spread in a mildly invasive fashion. This ornamental asparagus is an evergreen perennial with outward-sprawling fibrous and tuberous roots from which rise numerous semi-stiff arching stems (to 24” long) covered with linear, needle-like green leaves (.75 to 1” long). Technically, the stems contain true leaves (tiny, inconspicuous and scale-like) and larger leaf-like phylloclades which have the form and function of leaves. Tiny, inconspicuous, pea-like, fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Flowers are followed by small red berries which ripen by fall. Plants have thorns, but the thorns are so small as to be often not noticed.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. Plants can be grown outdoors year round as long as temperatures never dip below 20-25 degrees F. Plants perform best in organically rich, consistently moist but well drained soils in part shade (bright indirect light or filtered sun). Avoid direct hot afternoon sun which may cause the leaves to yellow. Tolerates full shade, but foliage may turn a lighter green. Plants may die to the ground in light freezes, but roots remain hardy to about 20-25 degrees F. North of Zone 9, plants can be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors. Asparagus fern is easily grown as a houseplant in the St. Louis area because it tolerates a wide range of temperatures, does not require high humidity and is easily pruned. It is best grown with a well-drained, peaty potting mixture. Water regularly from spring to autumn. It does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering over the winter months. Performs well with regular temperatures in summer and minimum 50F temperatures in winter. This plant is often taken outside for the growing season and brought back inside in early fall. Pinch back stem tips as needed to maintain plant form and promote dense foliage growth. If plant loses its attractive shape, stems may be cut back close to the soil level to regenerate. Propagate by seed or division (separate tubers). Birds eat the berries and help spread the seed to new locations where the seed will often readily sprout. Self-seeding can be mildly invasive in some subtropical to tropical areas (e.g., southern Florida and Hawaii).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Asparagus densiflorus, commonly called asparagus fern, is noted for its dense fern-like foliage which forms an arching mound that matures to 1-3’ tall spreading to 3-4’ wide. It is not a fern, however, but is a member of the asparagus family. It is native primarily to coastal areas in the southeastern part of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. It has escaped cultivation and naturalized in southern Florida where it has spread in a mildly invasive fashion. This ornamental asparagus is an evergreen perennial with outward-sprawling fibrous and tuberous roots from which rise numerous semi-stiff arching stems (to 24” long) covered with linear, needle-like green leaves (.75 to 1” long). Technically, the stems contain true leaves (tiny, inconspicuous and scale-like) and larger leaf-like phylloclades which have the form and function of leaves. Tiny, inconspicuous, pea-like, fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Flowers are followed by small red berries which ripen by fall. Plants have thorns, but the thorns are so small as to be often not noticed. This plant is also sometimes listed as Protasparagus densiflorus because plants in the genus Asparagus (e.g., the edible vegetable A. officinalis) have rhizomes but this plant does not. Species plants are not as widely grown in gardens as are certain popular cultivars such as ‘Myersii’ (foxtail fern) and Sprengeri group (emerald fern).Genus name is the classical name of this plant.Specific epithet is in reference to the dense flowers along the stem and/or to the dense foliage.","Problems

Above ground stems are not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they may die to the ground in severe winters (roots are usually hardy therein and will sprout new growth the following spring). In St. Louis, it is best to plant this vine in a protected location and apply a winter mulch. Established plants may send up root suckers which should be removed if spread is not desired.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Bignonia capreolata, known as cross-vine, is a vigorous, woody vine that climbs by branched tendrils with adhesive disks. It is grown primarily for its attractive flowers and its ability to rapidly cover structures with attractive foliage. Opposite, compound leaves are bifoliate. Each leaf consists of a pair of lanceolate to oblong dark green leaflets (to 6” long) and a branched tendril between them. Tendril branches terminate in adhesive disks that easily attach to walls. Foliage remains evergreen in the South, but turns reddish-purple in fall with subsequent leaf drop in the colder winter areas of its range. Axillary clusters (2-5 flowered cymes) of fragrant, trumpet-shaped, orange-red flowers (to 2” long) appear in spring. Flowers are followed by greenish, pod-like seed capsules (to 7” long) which mature in late summer and persist into fall.  
 

 This vine is in the same family as and closely related to Campsis radicans which is commonly known as trumpet vine.Genus name honors of Abbe Jean Paul Bignon (1662-1743), Librarian to Louis XIV.Specific epithet means having tendrils.A cross section of stem reveals a marking resembling the Greek cross, hence the common name.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Intolerant of shade. Tolerates heat, drought and a wide range of soils. Adapts to alkaline soils. Avoid frequent watering. Plants are intolerant of lots of moisture, and generally do not perform well in areas with high rainfall. When grown as a turfgrass for lawns, mowing is infrequently required. When needed, mow to a height of 2-3” tall. Also may be naturalized without mowing as a 4-6” tall grass. Plant seed in April-June. May also be established by sod or plugs.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Buchloe dactyloides, known as buffalo grass, is a dioecious, drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, fine-textured, warm season perennial grass that is native primarily to the Great Plains within the area from Minnesota to Montana south to Louisiana and Arizona. It is one of the dominant grasses of the shortgrass prairie. It is commonly called buffalo grass because it was at one time regularly grazed by herds of buffalo (American bison) that once populated the Great Plains. It typically grows 4-8” tall with gray-green curly leaves. It spreads by stolons. Somewhat inconspicuous green flowers bloom in summer (June -August), with male flowers appearing in comb-like spikes on slender stems rising above the leaves and with female flowers appearing in bur-like clusters on short stems hidden by the leaves. Buffalo grass is considered to be an excellent native forage grass. With the addition of new cultivars, buffalo grass is now becoming more popular as a low-maintenance turfgrass for lawns, parks, golf courses, roadsides and commercial areas. In optimum growing conditions, it can form a low maintenance turf which survives hot and humid summers with minimal water and fertilizer. The main disadvantages of buffalo grass as a lawn turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to mid-spring when grass is dormant, (2) invasive habit which may result in stoloniferous spread into adjacent plantings, and (3) intolerance of heavy foot traffic.Specific epithet means resembling fingers.","Problems

Winter hardy to USDA Zone 5 where it usually does not suffer any significant winter die-back. Unlike Buddleja davidii, this species blooms on the previous year's wood, so cutting plants to the ground in late winter each year is not an option. Prune in late spring immediately after flowering. Weeping habit may be best showcased by training and growing this plant as a single trunk tree.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Buddleja alternifolia is a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub or small single trunk tree which typically grows 8-15' tall (infrequently to 20' as a tree) with arching, drooping, willow-like branches. Tree form may superficially resemble a small weeping willow. Short clusters (to 3/4"" long) of lightly fragrant, lilac-purple flowers bloom in the leaf axils along the previous year's stems in spring. Flowers earlier than most other species of butterfly bush. Lance-shaped leaves (to 4"" long) are green above and grayish below. Unlike other cultivated species of Buddleja, this species has alternate leaves, hence the species and common names. Also sometimes commonly called fountain buddleia in reference to the growing habit. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.
 

 The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia. However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet refers to the alternate leaves of the species.Common name also refers to the alternate leaves of the species.","Problems

 Best grown in evenly moist, well-drained loams (sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade. Plants will grow well in a variety of part-shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun. Plants can grow in close to full shade, but typically are less vigorous and more open with decreased foliage density. When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to scorch, bronze in winter or suffer from mite attacks. Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline. Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing as needed. Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date. Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots. Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2”). Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small citrus tree will grow well in sandy, neutral, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. It has the best winter hardiness of any of the lemon-type fruits. Best performance occurs in full sun. Provide consistent and regular watering. Avoid wet poorly drained soils. When grown outside, this tree will bear fruit year around in warm temperatures, however it may slip into dormancy if winter temperatures dip significantly below 55F. It will tolerate brief temperatures around 32 F., but generally does not tolerate frost. This plant thrives in climates where daily temperatures range from low 70s F. in the daytime to high 50s F. at night. Elsewhere it may be grown in containers as a houseplant. Use an all purpose potting mix. Set container outdoors in late spring in full sun in a location protected from wind. Bring pot indoors in fall for overwintering in a bright sunny southern window. Mist plants with water almost daily in winter. Indoor plants usually fruit in spring. Hand pollination may be needed for indoor plants due to the lack of insects. New plants may be easily grown from cuttings.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Citrus, x meyeri, commonly called Meyer’s lemon, is native to China. It was introduced into the U.S. by Frank Meyer who reportedly found the plant in 1908 near Peking, China. It is believed to be a hybrid cross of Citrus limon (lemon) and Citrus reticulata (mandarin orange). It is less acidic, juicier and sweeter than common lemons. Trees typically grow to 6-10’ tall. Shiny dark green leaves are evergreen. Waxy, fragrant, white flowers appear year around in warm climates. Large rounded yellow fruit (to 3” diameter) with smooth, thin skin lacks the rough texture and pronounced nipple of the true lemon. Original Meyer lemon trees were symptomless carriers of a virus (tristeza) that killed other citrus family trees. Those original trees were mostly destroyed and replaced with a virus-free variety that today is referred to as improved Meyer lemon. Not much commercial growth of this fruit is done because the fruits are thin skinned and ship poorly.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet honors Frank Meyer.","Problems

 Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Unlike other species of Coreopsis, C. rosea and its cultivars have very little drought tolerance and need consistently moist soils in order to thrive. Avoid poorly-drained heavy clay soils, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flower stalks can be tedious for a large planting, but does tend to encourage additional bloom and prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Plants may be sheared in late summer to promote a fall rebloom and to tidy the planting (stems often become matted as summer progresses). In optimum growing conditions, plants will spread in the garden by rhizomes and self-seeding to form a dense ground cover, sometimes to the point of being considered aggressive.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Coreopsis rosea, sometimes commonly called pink coreopsis or pink threadleaf coreopsis, is primarily native to wet sandy soils along water margins in coastal plain areas from Nova Scotia to Maryland. It is noted for being the only coreopsis with pink flowers. It closely resembles C. verticillata in appearance and habit, but lacks the latter's heat and drought tolerance. It is a rhizomatous perennial which typically grows in dense, bushy clumps to 1-2' tall. Features daisy-like flowers (1/2 to 1"" diameter) with pink untoothed rays and yellow center disks. Flowers appear singly on short stalks in a profuse and lengthy summer bloom.

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Light afternoon shade helps avoid possible sun scald in hot summer climates. Best growth occurs in cool and dry summer climates. Plants dislike areas with high humidity and frequent rain. Seeds may be planted directly in garden soil after the last spring frost date. They may also be planted in pots. Plants grow rapidly (pinching off young leaves can begin in 30 days). Snip off flower stems before flowering to prolong harvest of leaves. Plant new seed every 2 weeks to insure a continuous crop of leaves. Allow some plants to flower and seed if harvest of coriander seed is desired. Seeds are ready for harvest in 90 days. Plants tend to bolt easily (abandon leaf growth, flower, seed and die) in hot summer climates. A late summer planting of seed can be done for fall harvest of leaves but seed will not mature before frost. Plants are annuals but have naturalized in some parts of North America.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Coriandrum sativum is a warm weather annual that is commonly grown in herb gardens for its lacy, strong-scented foliage (cilantro) and its aromatic seeds (coriander). It is native to southern Europe and the western Mediterranean. It typically grows in a basal clump to 24"" tall and to 18"" wide. Plants may sprawl in the garden. Finely-divided upper leaves are fern-like. Broad-lobed lower leaves resemble those of Italian parsley. Cilantro leaves are used for flavoring a number of food dishes including salads, salsas, meats, sauces and soups. Leaves are best used fresh, but may be frozen in ice cube trays for later use. Stems are also edible when young. Coriander seeds ripen in round, yellow-brown pods. Seeds are typically ready for harvest about 90 days after seed is planted (late summer to early autumn in St. Louis). Mature seeds have a pleasantly sweet-spicy fragrance and are used for flavoring sauces, meats, sausages, stews, chutneys, pies and cakes. Seeds are an ingredient found in curry powder. By contrast, young seeds are never used for culinary purposes because they have an unpleasant fragrance and bitter taste. White to pink to pale lavender flowers bloom above the foliage clump in loose compound umbels (to 2"" across). Swallowtail butterflies feed on plant leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek name koriandron from koris referring to the unpleasant smell of the unripe fruits which disappears when they are ripe and dry.Specific epithet means cultivated.","Problems

 Alpinia galanga, commonly known as Siamese ginger, Thai ginger or galangal, is a tropical evergreen perennial with a thick aromatic rhizome. It is native to Southeast Asia. For culinary use, the rhizome is typically cut up into small pieces, thin-sliced, pounded into a paste, or dried and powdered for inclusion as a flavoring in a variety of food dishes such as soups and curries. It is reportedly one of the most frequently used spices in Thai cooking, and is also quite popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Indonesian rendang is usually flavored with this rhizome. Each plant typically grows to 6' tall in a clump of stalks clad with long green leaves (12-15"" long by 2-3"" wide). Showy yellowish-white flowers with red centers bloom throughout the year on upright inflorescences. Flowers are followed by red fruits (1/2"" diameter) which emerge green and then turn yellow before finally maturing to red. Leaves, stalks, rhizomes and seeds all have a mild aromatic aroma. Foliage is attractive and plants may be grown ornamentally without harvesting the rhizome. Plants are evergreen when grown in frost-free locations. In Southern Asia, fresh rhizomes are commonly sold in markets. Rhizomes also have certain folk medicinal uses in Asia. In the U.S., rhizomes are generally available for purchase in most Asian groceries.

If bloom is desired, prune very lightly in early spring only as needed. If bloom is not a concern, stems may be cut back hard in early spring to a framework to induce growth of vigorous new shoots with larger than normal leaves.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cotinus coggygria, commonly known as smoketree, is an upright, loose-spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that is native from southern Europe to central China. It typically matures over time to 10-15’ tall and as wide. It gets its common name of smoketree (or smokebush) not from the tiny, insignificant, yellowish flowers which appear in branching, terminal panicles (to 6-8” long) in spring, but from the billowy hairs (attached to elongated stalks on the spent flower clusters) which turn a smokey pink to purplish pink in summer, thus covering the tree with fluffy, hazy, smoke-like puffs throughout summer. Bluish green leaves (to 3” long) are ovate to obovate. Fall color is highly variable, but at its best produces attractive shades of yellow, orange, and purplish-red.Genus name comes from the Greek word kotinus meaning olive.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word kokkugia meaning smoke tree.","Problems

Sometimes overseeded with rye. Bermuda grass has winter hardiness problems in the Midwest Transition Area, however, and is not recommended as a turfgrass for St. Louis. Some winter kill is to be expected when winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F. Needs regular dethatching. It is not recommended as a turfgrass for lawns in the St. Louis area.'Sundevil' is considered even less winter hardy than the species.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cynodon dactylon, commonly called Bermuda grass or wire grass, is a tough, warm season grass which spreads rapidly by both stolons and rhizomes. In optimum conditions, it will form a dense lawn which tolerates foot traffic well and excludes many common weeds. On the other hand, many homeowners consider it to be a noxious weed and expend considerable energy trying to eradicate it from their lawns and garden areas. The main disadvantages of Bermuda grass as a turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to late spring when grass goes dormant and (2) highly aggressive habit which results in spread into adjacent plantings such as flower beds, vegetable garden and borders.Genus name comes from the Greek words kyon meaning a dog and odous meaning a tooth.'Sundevil' is a coarse, seeded turfgrass variety which features light green blades.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. White grubs are the most common insect problem. Additional insects of concern include sod webworms, cutworms, armyworms, nematodes and mole crickets.

 Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Does well in both sandy and clay soils. Needs constant moisture.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Eupatorium perfoliatum, commonly called boneset, is a large, hairy, clump-forming, Missouri native perennial which typically occurs in wet soils in low woods, thickets, stream banks, meadows and prairies throughout the State. Flat-topped clusters (compound corymbs) of small, fluffy, white flowers appear above the foliage in late summer to fall. Perfoliate foliage is quite distinctive: the bases of the pairs of wrinkled, opposite, lance-shaped, medium green leaves unite to surround the hairy stems (perfoliatum meaning through the foliage). Historically, boneset was commonly included in medical herb gardens and used as a folk medicine for treatment of flus, fevers, colds and a variety of other maladies. Though some authorities claim the name boneset refers to a former use of the plant to aid the healing process for broken bones, others claim that the name is in reference to the plant's use as a diaphoretic in the treatment of an 18th century influenza called break bone fever. All parts of the plant are quite toxic and bitter. Also commonly called thoroughwort.Genus name comes from the Greek name for these herbaceous and shrubby plants in honor of Mithridates VI Eupator, 132-63 B.C., King of Pontus, who reportedly discovered the medicinal uses for some Eupatorium species plants.Specific epithet means perfoliate, having leaf bases that encircle the node, so that the stem apparently passes through it.","Problems

 Hydrangea macrophylla is best grown in rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade. Tolerates full sun only if grown in consistently moist soils. Soil pH affects the flower color of most cultivars except white (blue in highly acidic soils and lilac to pink in slightly acidic to alkaline soils). Add aluminum sulfate to the soil to make the flowers bluer or add lime to the soil to make the flowers pinker. Begin soil treatments well in advance of flowering, as in late autumn or early spring. Plants generally need little pruning. If needed, prune immediately after flowering by cutting back flowering stems to a pair of healthy buds. Prune out weak or winter-damaged stems in late winter/early spring. Best to mulch plants year-round with 3"" of shredded bark, peat or compost. Winter hardy to USDA Zone 6. For added protection, however, plants grown in USDA Zone 5 should be sited in sheltered locations and given additional winter protection, as needed, for the purposes of minimizing the risk of loss of significant numbers of flower buds or possible die-back to the ground in an extremely harsh winter. A burlap wrap of stems or circle of chicken wire filled with leaves or straw to 8-12"" are time-consuming and visually unattractive landscape options, but can be effective. Regardless of protective measures taken, most bigleaf hydrangeas simply will not bloom (or will bloom poorly) in some years because of a variety of winter occurrences beyond the control of the gardener (e.g. low temperatures, sudden wide temperature fluctuations, icy conditions, late frosts). Some newer cultivars have been selected that flower on both old and new wood. Their pruning and flowering can differ from that of the species.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Hydrangea macrophylla, commonly called big leaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub with a rounded habit that, in the St. Louis area, typically grows 3-6’ tall and as wide unless damaged by harsh winters or pruned smaller.

 Winter hardy to zones 7 to 10, Jasminum officinale prefer full sun to partial shade and a warm site. They grow well in regular garden soil with moderate levels of soil fertility and moisture, and they need frequent pinching and shaping to control growth. Indoors, jasmine are vigorous growers and most require support. They bloom from spring to fall and rest from October to March. After flowering, they should be pruned drastically. Repot, if necessary, at this time. They require high humidity and plenty of light to flower. Jasmine may be placed outdoors from May to September in partial shade. Keep plants cool in winter and let them rest. Make sure plants receive adequate, generous moisture during the growing season, but with good drainage.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Jasminum officinale, commonly called jasmine, is one of the first plants that comes to mind when one thinks of sweet fragrance. A single jasmine vine can perfume an entire room or garden. It is a sprawling, somewhat twining deciduous shrub, usually pruned heavily to keep its size contained. The foliage is slightly downy with pinnate leaves, having 5 to 9 leaflets. The flowers are white or very pale pink and fragrant from early summer to autumn.Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet means sold in shops.","Problems
 Jasminum officinale is usually trouble free, but you should watch for mealybugs, scale and whitefly. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants","Garden Uses
 In warmer climates, jasmine can be pruned and used as hedging plants. It is not hardy north of zone 7 and should therefore be brought inside in late summer or early fall. With its long blooming time and relatively easy culture, jasmine is a nice addition to an indoor garden or can be used as a container plant on a patio or deck to add fragrance to your outdoor living areas.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Juniperus horizontalis, commonly called creeping juniper, is a procumbent evergreen shrub that is native to Alaska, Canada and the northern U.S. from New England to New York to the Great Lakes, Wyoming and Montana. Distribution in the northern U.S. is somewhat spotty. It is typically found growing in rocky or sandy soils including rock outcroppings, stony slopes, coastal cliffs, prairies, sand dunes and stream banks. It forms a low groundcover that generally rises to 6-18” tall but spreads by long trailing branches with abundant short branchlets to form an often-dense, 4-10’ wide mat. Foliage is primarily scale-like (adult) with some awl/needle-like (juvenile) needles appearing usually in opposite pairs. Foliage is typically green to blue-green during the growing season, but often acquires purple tones in winter. Fleshy seed cones (dark blue berries) generally mature in two years, but are often absent on cultivated plants.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to the horizontal branches.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Junipers are generally susceptible to blights (dieback of stem tips), particularly in unusually rainy/wet springs. Cedar-apple and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers. Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils. Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, webworm, and scale. Watch for spider mites. Foliage on mature plants will sometimes die back in the center.","Garden Uses

 Juniperus scopulorum, commonly called Rocky Mountain juniper or Colorado red cedar, is native to the Rocky Mountains from Alberta to Texas and in other mountainous areas from British Columbia south to Arizona. In the Rockies, it is typically found in dry, rocky, foothills above 5000 feet in elevation. This is a broad pyramidal tree with shedding red-brown bark that grows to 50’ tall and 20’ wide in its native habitat. It is similar in appearance to eastern red cedar (J. virginiana) and may hybridize with it if grown in the same area. Light blue-green to dark green scale like foliage lies flat against the branches.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning “of cliffs or rocks” in reference to the mountainous habit of the species.‘Wichita Blue’ is a compact, conical, male form that grows slowly (6-12” per year) to 10-15’ tall, but may eventually reach 15-30’ tall. As the cultivar name suggests, it is noted for its blue or blue-gray foliage that retains good color all year.","Problems

 Juniperus virginiana, commonly called Eastern red cedar, is native to Missouri where it typically occurs on limestone bluffs and glades, wood margins, fields, pastures and fence rows throughout the state except for the southeastern lowlands (Steyermark). It is a broadly conical, sometimes columnar, dense, evergreen conifer with horizontal branching that typically grows to 30-65’ tall. Gray to reddish-brown bark exfoliates in thin shreddy strips on mature trees. Trunks are often fluted at the base. Heartwood is light brown and aromatic, and is commonly used for cedar chests. Dark blue green scale-like foliage. Foliage may turn brown-green in winter. Cultivars of this species often retain better foliage color in winter. This is a dioecious species (separate male and female trees). Female trees produce round, gray to blackish-green berry-like cones (1/4” diameter) that ripen in fall the first year. Berry-like cones are attractive to many birds.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet means of Virginia.","Problems

 Best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Does well in loamy, clay soils with good drainage. Benefits from a slow release fertilizer. Overly fertile soils tend to produce lush foliage growth at the expense of flowering with somewhat increased susceptibility to winter injury. Water roots deeply, particularly in dry spells, but avoid wetting the foliage. Plant in protected locations and apply a winter mulch. Growing crape myrtles in the St. Louis area can be tricky because the above ground branches often die to the ground in winter, particularly when temperatures dip below -5 degrees F. Above ground branches are considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 7, whereas roots are usually but not always hardy to USDA Zone 5. In the St. Louis area (Zone 6a), some gardeners prefer to grow these plants in somewhat the same manner as buddleias (butterfly bushes) by cutting all stems back to 8” in early spring each year. Roots will sprout new stems which typically grow 2-4’ tall (sometimes more) by the end of the growing season. Flowers appear on the new wood. It is also an option in St. Louis to grow these plants as woody shrubs by pruning them back to live wood in spring at the time new foliage begins to appear (in somewhat the same manner as with some shrub roses). With protection, top growth will survive some winters, but may still suffer significant injury or die to the ground in harsh winters.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lagerstroemia indica, commonly known as crape myrtle, is an upright, wide-spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub or small tree in the loosestrife family. It typically grows to 15-25’ tall. It is native from the Himalayas through southern China, southeast Asia and Japan, but has naturalized in the U.S. from Virginia to Arkansas south to Texas and Florida.  An additional common name is Lilac of the South in reference to its popularity in southern gardens (USDA Zones 7-9). Key ornamental features include long bloom period, exfoliating bark and superb fall color. Terminal, crepe-papery inflorescences (to 6-18” long) of showy flowers with crimped petals bloom in summer (sometimes to frost) on upright branches. In the wild, flowers are typically rose to red. Cultivated varieties have expanded the flower color range to include white, pink, mauve, lavender and purple. Alternate to sub-opposite, thick and leathery, privet-like, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3"" long) emerge light green often with a tinge of red, mature to dark green by summer and finally turn attractive shades of yellow-orange-red in fall. Flowers give way to round seed capsules which often persist well into winter. Smooth pale pinkish-gray bark on mature branches exfoliates with age. In the St. Louis area where winter injury can be a problem, plants will typically grow to 6-10’ tall. In the deep South, plants will grow much taller if not pruned back. Straight species plants are not sold in commerce. A multitude of named cultivars from dwarf to tree size have been introduced over the years, many of which are hybrids between L. indica and L. faueri.Genus name honors Magnus von Lagerstroem (1691-1759), Swedish botanist, Director of the Swedish East Indies Company and friend of Linnaeus.Specific epithet means of the Indies in reference to native territory.Common name is in reference to the crepe-papery inflorescences and the myrtle-like (Myrtus communis) features of the bark and foliage.","Problems
 Two main disease problems of crape myrtles are fungal leaf spot and powdery mildew. Foliage may yellow (chlorosis) in alkaline soils. Some susceptibility to aphids and scale. Winter injury, particularly to top growth, often occurs in USDA Zones 5 and 6.","Garden Uses

 Grow in average, dry to medium, well-drained, alkaline soil in full sun. English lavender can be difficult to grow in the St. Louis area, primarily because of winter stresses and high summer humidity. Well-drained soils are required, particularly in winter. Root rot commonly attacks plants grown in poorly drained soils. Prefers a light, sandy soil with somewhat low fertility. Remove faded flowers to promote continued bloom. Prune to shape in spring after new leaves appear. Prune back to 8” in spring every 3 years to control plant size and to promote robust, new growth. High summer humidity in the St. Louis area is not appreciated. To combat high humidity, consider using rock instead of organic mulch. English lavender has slightly better winter hardiness than lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia) for the St. Louis area, but still may appreciate a sheltered location and winter protection.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lavandula angustifolia, commonly called English lavender, has been a mainstay of herb gardens for many years. Despite its common name, it is not in fact native to England, but comes primarily from the Mediterranean region. It was reportedly named English lavender because of its ability to grow well in the English climate. This “true lavender” is commercially planted for harvesting its oils for use in perfumes. Lavender flowers and foliage are also popular additions to sachets and potpourris. English lavender varieties are more often used for culinary purposes than other types of lavender. This is a semi-woody plant that typically grows to 1.5-3’. Narrow, gray-green leaves (to 2 1/2” long) on square stems. Purple flowers appear in terminal spikes in late spring to early summer. Both foliage and flowers are highly aromatic. Leaves are evergreen in warm winter climates.Genus name comes from the Latin word lavo meaning I wash in reference to a former use of the plant as an aromatic wash.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.","Problems

 Leucophyllum frutescens, commonly called Texas sage, silver leaf or barometer bush, is a compact but loosely branched shrub that typically grows to 5-8' tall. Plants tend to sprawl with age unless pruned as needed. This shrub is native to rocky limestone slopes in calcareous soils in the Chihuahuan Desert extending from northern Mexico into Texas and New Mexico.  Attractive silver gray leaves (to 1"" long) with stellate hairs are close to being evergreen, but some leaf drop will occur in winter. Small, 5-lobed, tubular, purple flowers (to 1"" long) bloom singly from the leaf axils at various times during the year but primarily from summer into fall. Flower bloom is typically triggered by rains or significant soil moisture, hence the common name of barometer bush.

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Will grow in some shade, but best flowering is in full sun. Best in humusy, organically rich soils with good drainage. This is a twining vine that needs a support structure upon which to grow unless allowed to sprawl as a ground cover. Prune as needed immediately after flowering. Although deciduous in the St. Louis area, it will retain some foliage (semi-evergreen) in warm winter climates (USDA Zone 8 and above).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lonicera sempervirens, commonly called trumpet honeysuckle, is a vigorous, deciduous, twining vine which typically grows 10-15' (less frequently to 20') and is one of the showiest of the vining honeysuckles. It is primarily native to the southeastern U.S., but has escaped from gardens and naturalized in many other areas of the eastern U.S. including several counties in central and southern Missouri where it typically occurs along roadsides, along stream banks and in thickets (see Steyermark). 
 

 Large, non-fragrant, narrow, trumpet-shaped flowers are scarlet to orangish red on the outside and yellowish inside. Flowers appear in late spring at stem ends in whorled clusters. They are attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies and bees. Inedible red berries form in late summer to early fall and can be ornamentally attractive. The small red berries are attractive to birds. Oval, bluish-green leaves are glaucous beneath. This vine is evergreen in the warm winter climates of the deep South.Genus name honors Adam Lonitzer (1528-1586), German botanist, the author of an herbal (Kreuterbuch) many times reprinted between 1557 and 1783.Specific epithet means evergreen.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants like full sun in northern areas but appreciate some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Plants adapt to a wide range of soils including poor ones. Avoid wet soils, particularly in winter. Frequent pruning, including removal of spend flower stalks, tends to (1) encourage growth of new leaves which have the best fragrance, (2) minimize self-seeding and (3) form the most ornamentally attractive plants. Unpruned plants may acquire a somewhat weedy appearance.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Melissa officinalis, commonly called lemon balm, is a bushy herbaceous perennial of the mint family that is typically grown in herb gardens and border fronts for its lemon-scented leaves. It is native to southern Europe, but has escaped gardens and naturalized in many parts of the U.S. (Eastern, Midwestern and Pacific Northwest states). Wrinkled, ovate, medium green leaves (to 3” long) appear in pairs on square stems rising to 2’ tall. Tiny, two-lipped, white flowers appear in the leaf axils throughout summer. Although the flowers are ornamentally inconspicuous, honey bees love them. Leaves are edible and may be added to salads, soups, sauces or vegetables. Leaves are also used to flavor teas. Dried leaves may be added to sachets and potpourri. Plants also have a history of herbal medicine usage for a variety of purposes including, inter alia, calming nervous disorders, soothing insect bites and treating colds.Genus name comes from the Greek word melissa meaning a honeybee, also the name of a Cretan princess who first discovered how to obtain honey.Specific epithet means found in shops.

This grass will reseed to the point of being somewhat invasive in the milder parts of its growing range. Mulch helps prevent reseeding.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Miscanthus sinensis, commonly known as Chinese silver grass, Japanese silver grass or eulalia grass, is a clump-forming warm season grass that typically grows to 3-7’ tall. It is native to lowlands and lower alpine areas in Japan, Korea and China. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in over 25 states in the Central and Eastern U.S. east of the Mississippi River plus in several western States including Colorado and California. 
 

 This grass features a dense clump of upward-arching stems and leaves which give it a rounded, fountain-like appearance. Linear leaves (to 3-4’ long and 3/8” wide) have tapered tips, serrate margins and whitish to silvery midribs. Foliage often turns attractive shades of yellow to orange by mid-fall before gradually fading to beige-tan for winter. Pink to red flowers in feathery, whisk-like, loose terminal panicles (8-10” long) bloom above the foliage from late August to October. Flower panicles gradually turn beige by mid-fall as the seeds mature. Flower panicles and foliage both retain good arching shape, beige color and ornamental interest throughout winter, with enhanced attractiveness often coming from a covering of new fallen snow.  
 

 Miscanthus sinensis will spread somewhat invasively in the landscape, particularly in some of the milder areas of its growing range. It often initially spreads to disturbed sites such as roadsides, railroad right-of-ways or woodland margins. Invasive potential for the species is significant, but is of less concern for many of the numerous ornamental cultivars, some of which are sterile.Genus name comes from the Greek words miskos meaning a stem and anthos meaning flower in reference to the stalked spikelets.Specific epithet means Chinese.This grass was once included in the genus Eulalia, but was subsequently reclassified to the genus Miscanthus with retention of its common name of Eulalia grass by many gardeners.","Problems
 No frequently occurring insect or disease problems. In some areas of the U.S., miscanthus mealybug and miscanthus blight are becoming significant problems.

Glossy, wiry, thread-like, dark green leaves and stems form an attractive basal clump to 2’ tall. It is the fall flowering, however, that most distinguishes this grass. Masses of airy, open, loosely branched inflorescences (each to 12” long) in pink to pinkish-red float above the foliage in a lengthy fall bloom. Tan seed plumes remain attractive in winter. Plants typically grow to 3’ tall x 3’ wide when in flower.Genus name honors Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg (1753-1815), Lutheran pastor in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., distinguished amateur botanist.Specific epithet means fine or hair-like.'White Cloud' was introduced by Superior Trees Nursery of Lee, Florida. It is slightly larger and more upright than the species and blooms a little later. It has fluffy plumes of delicate white flowers in late summer and fall that rise a foot above the narrow blue green foliage. The flowering stalks will mature and persist into winter. ‘White Cloud’ grows 3 to 4 ft. tall and 2 to 3 ft. wide.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Best initially grown with constant moisture, but once established in the landscape it will grow in a wide range of soil conditions ranging from wet swampy areas to dry xeric uplands. This shrub is also tolerant of high winds and salt spray, and may be grown in seaside areas. Fixes atmospheric nitrogen which helps it survive in poor soils. Shrubs tend to sucker, sometimes forming sizable colonies in optimum growing conditions. This shrub is similar to northern bayberry (M. pennsylvanica), but is by contrast a southern heat-loving evergreen species. 
 

 This species is dioecious (male and female flowers borne in catkins on separate plants). Female plants are preferred in the landscape because they produce the attractive and sometimes useful fruit. At least one male plant is needed to facilitate pollination of the female flowers.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Morella cerifera, commonly known as southern wax myrtle or southern bayberry, is a large, irregularly-shaped, dense-branching, nitrogen-fixing, suckering, fast-growing, evergreen shrub (semi-evergreen in colder northern parts of the growing area) that typically grows to 10-15’ tall and 8-10’ wide, but occasionally reaches a tree-like height of 20’ tall or more. It is native to the southeastern U.S. from New Jersey to Florida through the Gulf States to Oklahoma and Texas and further south into Mexico and Central America. It is typically found in a variety of habitats including wetlands, river margins, sand dunes, pine barrens, hillsides, and upland forests.
 

 The fruits of this species have been used for many years to make bayberry candles, soaps and sealing wax.
 

 Glossy, aromatic, oblanceolate, olive green leaves (to 3-5” long) are dotted with tiny yellow resin glands. Leaves, particularly the new growth, emit the distinctive bayberry candle fragrance when crushed. Flowers are fragrant but non-showy, with only the flowers on male plants (catkins to 1” long) displaying some color (a drab yellowish-green). Flowers bloom in late winter to early spring. Pollinated female flowers are followed by small attractive clusters of tiny, globose, blue-gray fruits which mature in late summer to fall, with persistence through winter. Each fruit is surrounded by an aromatic waxy substance.  
 

 Birds eat the fruits in fall and winter, thus helping the plants to naturalize by disbursing the seed. 
 

 These shrubs are considered to be potential fire hazards in some areas because the leaves, stems and branches contain flammable aromatic compounds. 
 

 Myrica cerifera is a synonym.Specific epithet means wax-bearing.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf browning typically occurs in cold winters. Watch for leaf anthracnose and leaf mosaic.","Garden Uses
 Garden ornamental with a history of use for medicinal purposes and candlemaking. This is a versatile shrub that can be used in woodland gardens or shrub borders, as a screen or informal hedge, in wet or shady sites, or on a bank for erosion control. Salt tolerance makes it appropriate for locations near roads that are salted in winter. Interesting plant for grouping in the corner of a large herb garden. Good selection for stream or pond margins where periodic flooding or drought may occur. Also attractive as a small tree with lower limbs removed.",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Single specimens may fruit poorly. This shrub is evergreen in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10. In the St. Louis area, it is considered to be semi-evergreen to deciduous because plants will typically lose their foliage (become deciduous) as soon as winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F., with the stems sometimes dying to the ground.

 Nandina domestica, commonly called heavenly bamboo, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub that is ornamentally grown for its interesting foliage and its often spectacular fruit display. It is native to Japan, China and India. This is a rhizomatous, upright, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 4-8’ tall and to 2-4’ wide. In St. Louis, it is semi-evergreen to deciduous, and typically grows shorter since the stems often will die to the ground in winter. Although it belongs to the Barberry family, it is commonly called heavenly bamboo because its erect, cane-like stems and compound leaves resemble bamboo. Tiny whitish flowers with yellow anthers appear in late spring in loose, erect, terminal clusters. Flowers are followed by sprays of spherical, two-seeded, red berries which persist from fall to spring, providing winter interest. 
 

 Heavenly bamboo tends to invade adjacent lands including certain forested areas of the southeastern U.S. and naturalize therein. It is now considered to be an invasive species in some southern states. Additionally, the berries of Nandina domestica have been linked to toxicity in cedar waxwing birds.Genus name is the Latinized form of the Japanese name of this plant Nanten.Specific epithet means domesticated.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it may be grown in moist, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade. In St. Louis, it is easily grown indoors as a houseplant. Use a peaty, soil-based potting mix. Site in bright indirect light with no direct sun. Tolerant of some shade. Soils should be kept consistently moist, with only a slight reduction in watering from fall to late winter. Prefers high humidity and may appreciate being set on a tray of wet pebbles. Weak fertilizer applications may be made monthly from spring to early fall. Will shed fronds if soils dry out, at which point all fronds may be cut back to about 2” to regenerate. Frond tips may brown up in winter conditions where humidity is low.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Nephrolepis exaltata, commonly called sword fern or Boston fern, is native to Florida, West Indies, Mexico, Central America, South America, Polynesia and Africa. It is an evergreen fern that grows with an upright spreading habit to 3’ tall and as wide. In its native habitat, it may grow to as much as 7’ tall. It is an easy and popular fern to grow indoors. Generally sword-shaped fronds have shallow toothed to entire pinnae. Fronds initially grow upward but arch gracefully with age. A number of different forms are available in commerce including the very popular cultivar ‘Bostoniensis’, commonly called Boston fern, which many years ago earned the reputation of being a classic parlor fern. A number of additional cultivars in commerce feature such variations as curly, wavy, twisted, drooping, double-pinnate and overlapping fronds.Genus name comes from the Greek words nephros meaning a kidney and lepis meaning a scale.Specific epithet means very tall or lofty.","Problems

Plants will easily reseed in the garden in optimum conditions.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Phlox drummondii is an annual phlox that is native to grasslands and open woods in central and eastern Texas. It typically grows to 6-9” (less frequently to 15”) tall. It has escaped gardens and naturalized along roads, fields and waste areas in many parts of the U. S., particularly in the southeastern states. Fragrant, trumpet-shaped, five-lobed, rose-red flowers with short narrow tubes appear in clusters at the stem ends in a spring bloom typically extending from April/May to early July. Plants decline significantly as the heat of summer sets in, but may revive in fall. In cool summer climates, plants will continue to bloom throughout summer. Cultivars, often in compact sizes and sometimes with double flowers, extend the range of flower colors to include varying shades of pink, red, lavender, purple, buff and white. Flowers often have a different colored eye. Oblong to lance-shaped, stem-clasping, leaves (to 3” long) are bright green, with upper leaves alternate and lower leaves opposite.The genus name is derived from the Greek word phlox meaning flame in reference to the intense flower colors of some varieties.Specific epithet honors Thomas Drummond (1790-1835) who collected plants in Texas and sent seeds from Texas to England.","Problems

 Grow in moderately fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Prefers rich, moist, organic soils. Also prefers moderate summer temperatures over the heat and humidity of the deep South. Needs good air circulation (space well and thin out stems as needed) to help combat potential powdery mildew problems. Intolerant of drought and needs to be watered in dry spells. Avoid overhead watering however. Appreciates a summer mulch which helps keep the root zone cool. For winter, cut plants to the ground and remove from the garden plus clean up all plant areas in order to minimize possible powdery mildew infection for the following growing season. Remove faded flower panicles to prolong bloom period and to prevent unwanted self-seeding (cultivars generally do not come true from seed).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Phlox paniculata, commonly known as garden phlox, is native from New York to Iowa south to Georgia, Mississippi and Arkansas.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized into areas beyond its original native range. In Missouri, it is typically found south of the Missouri River in moist or rich low woods, thickets, alluvial banks and gravel bars along streams and bluff bases (Steyermark). This is an upright perennial that grows in a clump to 2-4' tall and to 2-3' wide on stiff stems clad with conspicuously veined, opposite, pointed, elliptic, deep green leaves (to 4-6"" long).  Fragrant, tubular, pink-purple to white florets (to 3/4” diameter) are densely packed in large, tiered, domed terminal clusters (to 6-8"") over a long July to September bloom period. Each individual floret has a long corolla tube and five flat petal-like lobes. Butterflies love the flowers.  
 

 A large number of garden phlox cultivars in flower colors including white, lavender, pink, rose, red and bi-color are available in commerce. Cultivars resistant to powdery mildew are often the best choices.The genus name is derived from the Greek word phlox meaning flame in reference to the intense flower colors of some varieties.Specific epithet refers to the plant bearing flowers in panicles.","Problems
 Phlox is not always an easy plant to grow well. Phlox bugs, powdery mildew and root rot can be serious problems. Spider mites can also be a problem, particularly in hot, dry conditions. Taller stems may need staking.","Garden Uses
 Garden phlox is a staple of the perennial border. Mixes well with other perennials and provides long summer bloom. Regardless of flower color, garden phlox is attractive to hummingbirds and is a good selection for inclusion in a bird garden.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

In cool climates, containers may be overwintered indoors in bright but cool (55-65 degree F.) temperatures. If container soils are overwatered, leaflet tips turn yellowish-black. If container soils are underwatered, fronds will sag. Reduce watering of indoor plants in winter but do not allow soils to totally dry out. Container plants tend to remain compact for long periods of time.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Phoenix canariensis, commonly called Canary Island date palm, is a large evergreen palm tree with a massive trunk that matures to 40-60' (less frequently to as much as 90') tall. Notwithstanding size, this palm is a slow grower which may only reach 10' tall over the first 15 years. The trunk is topped with a rounded crown of upright arching palmate leaves which gracefully spread to 20-40' wide. Although native to the Canary Islands, this palm is now grown in frost-free areas around the world. In the U.S., it is grown in Florida, Georgia (southern coast), Gulf Coast, Texas (southern), Arizona, Nevada and California. It will grow in Hawaii, but distribution there appears to be limited. This palm is noted for having a massive, thick, columnar, single, gray-brown trunk (matures to as much as 4' in diameter) with distinctive diamond-shaped leaf base scars. Trunk is topped by arching pinnate fronds (each to 15-20' long). Each frond has 80-100 rigid, narrow, lanceolate leaflets (to 12-18"" long) on each side of the central rachis. The leafless lower portion of each petiole is covered with sharp spines (2-3"" long). Creamy white to pale yellow flowers in dense, pendant panicles (to 3-4' long) bloom on male and female plants (dioecious) intermittently throughout the year. Flowers on female palms are followed by yellow-orange, date-like fruits (to 1"" long) which are ornamentally showy but poor-tasting to the point of being only technically edible.Genus name comes from the Greek name.Specific epithet means of the Canary Islands.","Problems
 Susceptible to lethal yellowing. Leaf spots and rots. Mealybugs, scale and thrips are often present on young plants. Spider mites may attack container plants.  Fruit drop can be messy.","Garden Uses
 Where winter hardy, this palm may be grown in a variety of locations including along streets, slopes, skylines or parks. Excellent in groves or small groupings. It can be planted on residential lawns as a specimen, but it needs a very large space. Additional residential area options include growth as a container plant on patios or near entrances. Where winter temperatures are too cool, container plants can be overwintered indoors.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Generally tolerant of urban conditions. Early spring flowers may be damaged by frost. Prune as needed in winter.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pyrus calleryana, commonly called Callery pear, is native to China and Taiwan. It is an upright-branched ornamental tree. It grows pyramidal to columnar in youth, but tends to become oval to spreading with age. It is noted for its early profuse spring bloom, quality glossy green foliage and often excellent fall color. Shoots on species plants are thorny, but some cultivars are thornless. It produces small, inedible, greenish-yellow fruits (to 1/2” diameter) which are of little practical value or ornamental interest. Joseph Callery, a French missionary, discovered and collected this plant in China in 1858. In 1917, seed was brought to the U.S. from China for hybridization experiments aimed at improving fireblight resistance for the common fruiting pear (P. communis). The experiments generally proved unsuccessful. In the 1950s, callery pear emerged in U.S. commerce as a promising new ornamental tree, leading to massive landscape plantings. By the 1980s, concerns about both overplanting and structural weakness (limb breakage from wind, ice and snow) began to surface. Today, additional concerns about invasiveness (non-sterile forms are escaping cultivation and naturalizing in some areas) are being addressed. Narrow-oval, glossy dark green leaves (to 3” long) have distinctively wavy margins. Leaves dance in the breeze due to long petioles. Leaves turn attractive reddish-purple to bronze-red in fall. Five-petaled, creamy white flowers (each to 3/4” wide) in dense corymbs appear in profusion in early spring.Specific epithet and common name honor Joseph Callery, a French missionary, who discovered and collected this plant in China in 1858.‘Aristocrat’ is a thornless, oval-pyramidal, ornamental pear that typically grows to 25-35’ tall and to 20-25’ wide. It has more horizontal branching than on many other callery cultivars.","Problems
 ‘Aristocrat’ is an attractive ornamental flowering tree for the landscape. It is susceptible to limb breakage or splitting from strong winds, snow or ice, but has better structural strength that some other callery cultivars such as P. calleryana ‘Bradford’. It is also susceptible to fireblight. Viable seed can be produced when Callery pear cultivars cross-pollinate. Please see below for more information on its invasive spread in Missouri and other states.","Garden Uses

 Quercus macrocarpa, commonly called bur oak or mossycup oak, is one of the most majestic of the native North American oaks. It is a medium to large sized deciduous oak of the white oak group that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 150’) tall with a broad-spreading, rounded crown. Acorn cups are covered with a mossy scale or bur near the rim, hence the common names. It is native to a variety of habitats in central and eastern North America. Best growth occurs in bottomland soils, particularly in the Ohio River valley. In Missouri, it typically occurs in low woods and stream valleys in the Ozark region, but on dry upland soils in the unglaciated parts of the state north of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 1 1/2” long), with fringed, burry cups that extend to approximately 1/2 to 3/4 the acorn length. Acorns are an important source of food for wildlife. Leathery, dark green leaves (6-12” long) with 5-9 rounded lobes are variable in shape, but usually have a pair of deep central sinuses that extend nearly to the midrib giving the leaf a waisted appearance. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow-brown. Twigs sometimes are ridged with corky wings.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and carpa meaning fruit in reference to the large acorn size.","Problems
 Oaks are susceptible to a large number of diseases, including oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew.

 Best grown in acidic, humusy, well-drained loams in part shade. This species of azalea is tolerant of moist to wet soils including ones with somewhat poor drainage (its native habitat is swampy lowland areas). It also tolerates periodic flooding, but will not grow in soils where the roots are submerged in water. Root rot is less likely to occur with this species. Prefers a sun dappled shade or high open part shade. Foliage may scorch in full sun unless soils are kept uniformly moist. Roots must never be allowed to dry out. Acidify soils prior to planting and thereafter as needed. This azalea should never be planted near a black walnut or butternut tree (roots of both trees produce toxic juglones which will typically damage or kill rhododendrons/azaleas growing within or close to the drip line of either tree). It is best sited in a location protected from strong winter winds. This shrub has a shallow, fibrous root system (do not cultivate around the shrub) and will benefit from a good mulch (wood chips, bark or pine needles) for retention of moisture, stabilization of soil temperatures and winter protection. Clip off spent flower clusters immediately after bloom as practicable. Plants will slowly naturalize by root suckers.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Rhododendron viscosum, commonly known as swamp azalea, is a loose, upright-spreading, deciduous woody shrub that typically grows to 3-5' (less frequently to 8') tall. Branching opens up with age. It is one of 17 species of azalea which are native to the U.S.  It is typically found in swamps, bogs, stream margins and wet lowlands from southwestern Maine to northeastern Ohio south to Florida and Alabama. It may be found at some higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains. Fragrant (musky clove-like aroma), tubular, white to pale pink flowers (1 1/4"" across) bloom in clusters of 4-9 after the leaves have emerged in May-July (one of the last of the native azaleas to flower). Each flower has 5 petal-like lobes. Narrow, obovate to oblong-ovate leaves (to 2 1/2"" long) with wedge-shaped bases and blunt/short-pointed tips are clustered at the branch ends. Leaves are dark green above and pale green below. Leaves turn attractive shades of yellow, orange and purple in fall. Branchlets are hirsute (stiff hairs). Fruits are egg-shaped capsules (to 3/4"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek words rhodo meaning rose and dendron meaning tree. Transferred from the Greek name for Nerium oleander.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word viscosus meaning sticky in reference to the sticky substance excreted by glandular hairs on the corolla tubes of the flowers.Additional common names include clammy azalea in reference to its sticky (viscous) corolla tubes and honeysuckle azalea (even though it is a rhododendron and not a honeysuckle) in reference to the resemblance of its flowers in both appearance and fragrance to the flowers of some honeysuckles.","Problems
 Azaleas are susceptible to many insect and disease problems, including but not limited to canker, crown rot, root rot, leaf spot, rust, powdery mildew, aphids, borers, lacebugs, leafhoppers, mealybugs, mites, nematodes, scale, thrips and whitefly. A healthy plant in the proper environment with proper care should have limited problems, however.","Garden Uses

 Best grown in moist, slightly acidic, well-drained garden loams in full sun to part shade, but this rose is also very adaptable to somewhat poor soils, including sandy, clay or gravelly ones. Best flowering and disease resistance generally occur in full sun. Water deeply and regularly (mornings are best). Avoid overhead watering. Excellent drainage is one of the keys to growing this shrub well. Avoid wet soils. Good air circulation promotes vigorous and healthy growth and helps control foliar diseases. Summer mulch helps retain moisture, keeps roots cool and discourages weeds. Remove spent flowers to encourage rebloom (flower removal does prevent hip growth). Remove and destroy diseased leaves from plants, as practicable, and clean up and destroy dead leaves from the ground around the plants both during the growing season and as part of a thorough cleanup during winter (dormant season). Prune as needed in late winter to early spring.  This rose is winter hardy to USDA Zone 2 where temperatures can dip to -50 degrees F. in winter.  It has escaped plantings and naturalized in at least nineteen states (mostly in the northeast and central U. S.). Inland, it has escaped gardens, often being found along roadsides and railroad right of ways. Along the Atlantic coast (Maine to Virginia) and Great Lakes regions it grows exceedingly well in sand and has over time naturalized in dry sandy/gravelly coastal plains, sandy beaches and sand dune habitats (giving rise to additional common names of beach rose and salt spray rose).  It can be invasive in some areas (particularly New England coastal areas). It is very tolerant of salt spray. Seeds are spread not only by birds and animals, but also in coastal areas by seawater.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Rosa rugosa is native to northern China, Korea and Japan. It is a bristly, prickly, sprawling, suckering shrub rose that typically grows in a rounded form to 4-6' tall and as wide. Unless restrained, it will over time spread by suckers to form dense thickets. Odd-pinnate dark green leaves (each with 5-9 leaflets) turn yellow (sometimes a quality orange-red) in fall. Each leaflet (to 2"" long) has pronounced veins, a wrinkled appearance, serrated edges and downy undersides. Fragrant flowers are rose pink to white (to 3 1/4"" across). Flowers are primarily single (5 petals), but are semi-double or double in some varieties and hybrid cultivars. Flowers appear singly or in clusters. Flowers primarily bloom from late May to July, with some additional scattered bloom to early fall. Flowers are followed by fleshy, edible (with some bitterness), tomato-shaped hips (to 1"" diameter) which appear green but ripen to bright red by late summer and persist on the shrub until late fall sometimes extending into winter.  Hips are used to make jams and jellies (rose hip jam). Deadheading spent flowers may encourage rebloom, but at the cost of preventing rose hip development. Stems are covered with abundant sharp thorns, making this an excellent impenetrable hedge. Ability to thrive in sandy seashore habitats combined with tomato-shaped hips led to the additional common names of beach tomato and sea tomato for this shrub. Because of its tolerance for salt and sand, this rose has been planted along ocean shores to help stabilize beaches/control beach erosion. Many varieties and hybrid cultivars (single to double flowers in colors of pink, purple or white) have been developed.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means wrinkled in reference to the appearance of the foliage.","Problems
 Roses are susceptible to a large number of diseases, the most common of which are black spot, powdery mildew, rust and rose rosette. Although good cultural practices are the first line of defense in disease control, regular preventative fungicide applications throughout the growing season are usually required, particularly in humid climates with regular summer rainfall such as the St. Louis area. Potential insect problems include aphids, beetles, borers, scale, thrips, rose midges, leafhoppers and spider mites. Local rose associations and extension services are usually able to offer specific recommendations and advice for selecting and growing roses.
 

 Rosa rugosa, however, is noted for having excellent disease resistance.","Garden Uses

 Best grown in organically rich, slightly acidic, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Intolerant of wet soils which can cause root rot. When grown for harvest of its raspberry fruits, raised beds should be considered in areas with heavy clay soils. Prune out fruiting canes of both summer and everbearing cultivars in summer immediately after fruiting and any non-fruiting canes that exhibit weakness or disease. new shoot will develop and, everbearing cultivars will produce fruit on the tips of these shoots. In late winter, remove any canes damaged by winter and thin, as needed, the remaining canes. Cut back the tips of everbearers that fruited last fall but leave the rest of cane for summer fruiting. Promptly remove excess new plants and suckers to control spread. Stems may root where they touch the ground. Plants adapt to a variety of soils, preferring those that are reasonably fertile and of medium and consistent moisture. Most do well in sun, but a few prefer light shade. Pruning is essential in order to keep plants well-maintained. It is generally best to prune out old, summer-bearing canes as soon as fruiting is over for purposes of encouraging the production of new canes. Raspberry roots are perennial but the leaf- and fruit-bearing canes are biennial, each cane living only two growing seasons before dying. In the wild, plants spread by suckers, stolons, rhizomes or root crowns to rapidly colonize certain areas, particularly disturbed areas such as those left after logging or forest fires. If grown for ornamental reasons, raspberries are best located in areas where they can naturalize.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Rubus idaeus, commonly called red raspberry, is, for the most part, an erect-to spreading- to sprawling, thicket-forming, deciduous shrub with biennial, often prickly, cane-like stems. It typically grows to 3-9’ tall. This genus has two main varieties, namely, Rubus idaeus var. idaeus (European raspberry) which is native to Eurasia and Rubus idaeus var. strigosa (American red raspberry) which is native to a large part of North America from Alaska and Canada south to California, Oklahoma and North Carolina. In the wild, raspberries typically grow in a variety of locations including open woods, ravines, heaths, streambanks, bluffs and wooded mountain slopes.  
 

 Commercially grown raspberries are mostly cultivars of European raspberry or American red raspberry or crosses between the two varieties.  
 

 Raspberry shrubs are primarily grown for harvesting the tasty fruits. Leaves are alternate, usually divided into 3-5 leaflets which are arranged pinnately, pedately, or less commonly palmately, but infrequently undivided. First year stems (primocanes) bear only leaves. Lateral branches in the second year (floricanes) produce leaves, flowers and fruits. Flowers are in clusters, racemes or panicles, but are occasionally solitary, and are generally white but sometimes pink to rosy-purple. Flowers bloom in spring. Each flower has five petals, five sepals, five bracts, numerous stamens, and several pistils clustered on a cone-shaped core known as a receptacle.  Botanically the fruits are not berries (though they are usually called berries), but are coherent aggregations of tiny drupelets. Fruits separate from the receptacle when picked with each raspberry resembling a hollow cone. Fruits ripen in summer. Many wild raspberries have very little garden merit, and, if not properly cared for, can easily spread to form tangled masses of impenetrable, thorny stems.Genus name is the Latin name for brambles (blackberry and raspberry).Specific epithet means of Mt. Ida in reference to the belief that raspberries were first discovered on Mt. Ida in Greece.","Problems
 Anthracnose, botrytis, root rot and other fungal diseases can cause serious problems that may necessitate chemical treatments. Cane borers and crown borers are potentially serious insect pests.","Garden Uses
 Raspberries are primarily grown for harvest of their tasty fruits. Cultivars featuring raspberries superior in size and flavor to those of species plants are available in commerce for planting in home gardens plus are commercially grown for sale of the fruit around the world to those who covet the taste of a raspberry. The straight species is rarely grown in home gardens for fruit production.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3 to 6 or 7 where it is best grown in deep, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage color is in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers moist, humusy, nutrient-rich, neutral to slightly acidic loams. Spreads by root suckers to form colonies. Prune suckers as they appear unless naturalizing. A large number of late winter pruning options include (a) pruning out dead or weakened stems, (b) shortening one year stems or (c) cutting some stems back to the ground to rejuvenate. Some horticulturists recommend a hard spring pruning for maintaining best foliage appearance and habit.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Sambucus racemosa, commonly known as red elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous suckering shrub which typically grows to 8-12’ tall with a somewhat sprawling habit. It features (1) opposite, pinnate-compound, green leaves (6-9” long) which have 5-7 leaflets (each to 4” long), (2) dome-shaped clusters (panicled cymes) of numerous, late spring to early summer, tiny, fragrant, white flowers and (3) dark red (black in the case of the Rocky Mountain elderberry known as S. racemosa var. melanocarpa), summer-to-fall elderberry fruits in upright clusters. This shrub is native to Europe, northern Asia and parts of Alaska, across Canada and the northern U.S. south to California and New Mexico but mostly south in the central and eastern states to South Dakota, Missouri, and Georgia where it is typically found growing in moist woodlands, thickets, stream banks, fields, fence rows and roadsides.  
 

 Fruits are sour and usually not consumed raw by humans, but may be cooked for use in the preparation of wine, jelly and pies. Fruits are attractive to wildlife. 
 

 Historically, Sambucus racemosa (native to Europe and Asia) was commonly known as European red elder and the very similar Sambucus pubens also known as S. racemosa var. pubens (native to North America) was known as American red elder.  Many authorities have now grouped both of these red elders together under the name of Sambucus racemosa.Genus name comes from the Latin name, perhaps connected with sambuca a kind of harp.Specific epithet means with flowers in racemes.","Problems

 Schizachyrium scoparium, commonly called little bluestem, is native to prairies, fields, clearings, hills, limestone glades, roadsides, waste areas and open woods from Alberta to Quebec south to Arizona and Florida. It was one of the dominant grasses of the vast tallgrass prairie region which once covered rich and fertile soils in many parts of central North America. It typically matures to 2-4’ (less frequently to 5’) tall, and features upright clumps of slender, flat, linear green leaves (to 1/4“ wide), with each leaf having a tinge of blue at the base. Purplish-bronze flowers appear in 3” long racemes on branched stems rising above the foliage in August. Flowers are followed by clusters of fluffy, silvery-white seed heads which are attractive and often persist into winter. Many consider the most outstanding ornamental feature of this grass to be its bronze-orange fall foliage color.Genus name comes from the Latin schizein meaning to split and achyron meaning chaff.Specific epithet means broomlike.Common name is in reference to the lavender-blue color on the stem bases.","Problems

 The Thanksgiving cactus is also commonly called the holiday or crab cactus. It grows best in light shade. Full sunlight is beneficial in midwinter, but bright sun during the summer months can make plants look pale and yellow. Ideal growth occurs at temperatures between 70° and 80° F during its growing season from April to September. Do not let temperatures rise above 90° F once the flower buds are set in the fall. Continuous warm temperatures can cause flower buds to drop.
 

 The secret of good flower bud production involves temperature and dark (photoperiod) control. For best flowering provide 1) Bright light, 2) Night temperatures between 55° and 65° F, and 3) Long nights – thirteen hours or more of continuous darkness each day is required before flowering will occur. Long nights should be started about the middle of September and continued for eight weeks.
 

 Water the growing medium when it is dry to the touch. The holiday cactus is tolerant of dry, slightly under-watered conditions. Do not let the soil become waterlogged, especially during the dark days of winter. Do not let the soil dry out either. Reduce watering from fall through spring. Fertilize plants monthly from the time new growth starts in late winter or early spring, and throughout the summer using a one-quarter strength soluble fertilizer. Reduce fertilizer during the fall and early winter.
 

 The Thanksgiving cactus flowers best when kept somewhat potbound. Repotting is necessary only about once in three years. The potting media must be well-drained with good aeration, because the plant does not grow well in heavy, wet mixes. A good mix may contain one part potting soil, two parts peat moss and one part sharp sand or perlite.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Schlumbergera truncata, commonly called crab cactus, Thanksgiving cactus or holiday cactus, is all the same plant. It is a popular, winter-flowering houseplant native to Brazil, available in a wide variety of colors including red, purple, oranges, pinks and creams. In its native environment, these cacti grow on rocks or in trees where hummingbirds pollinate the flowers. The stems are segmented, flattened to round in cross-section, with weak or no spines. The stems are graceful and arching and are an easy-care plant for most homes.Genus name honors Frederick Schlumberger, Belgian horticulturist.Specific epithet mean cut off square.","Problems
 This cactus commonly drops unopened flower buds, which may be induced by an excessive number of buds or a sudden change in temperature, light or other environmental factors, such as drying out of the growing medium. Lack of flowering is often due to light interrupting the long night period (13 hours) that is required for flowering initiation to occur. The major disease is root rot, which can be prevented by avoiding excessive watering. Insects and related pests include mealybugs, soft brown scale, red spider mites and aphids. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants","Garden Uses
 In its native area, Schlumbergera truncata is grown outdoors as an epiphyte or in rock gardens. In cooler climates, this plant can be grown in baskets or pots for brightly-lit window sills. It is sold primarily around the holiday season as a gift or decorative item.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Spiraea prunifolia, commonly called bridalwreath spirea or just bridalwreath, is an upright, clumping, deciduous shrub with arching branching. It typically grows 4-8’ tall with a similar spread, often becoming somewhat open and leggy over time. It is particularly noted for its early spring bloom of double white flowers (each to 1/3” diameter) that appear in April in 3- to 6-flowered clusters (stalkless corymbs) in an often profuse bloom along the bare branching prior to the emergence of the foliage. Small, elliptic to ovate, finely-toothed, shiny dark green leaves (to 1.5” long) are soft-pubescent beneath. Foliage often develops attractive red-orange-yellow fall color. S. prunifolia ‘Plena’ is the long-favored bridalwreath that is regularly sold in commerce. Species plants as well as the single-flowered plant (Spiraea prunifolia var. simpliciflora) are generally not available. It should be noted that the double-flowered plant was botanically described prior in time to the single-flowered plant, hence the double flower became the species and the single flower became a variety or form of the species.Genus name comes from the Greek word speira meaning wreath in reference to the showy flower clusters seen on most shrubs in the genus.Specific epithet means with leaves like the genus Prunus.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Too much shade, however, may impede leaf drying and promote the onset of disease. The woolly leaves of this plant tend to trap moisture, and in humid climates such as the St. Louis area, plant leaves are susceptible to attack from rot and leaf spot where too much moisture is present.

 Ulmus parvifolia, commonly called Chinese elm or lacebark elm, is a medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to 40-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with a rounded crown and long pendulous branching. It is native to China, Korea and Japan. It is noted for its excellent foliage, multi-colored bark, rapid growth and good resistance to Dutch elm disease. Insignificant, small, reddish-green flowers appear in late summer. Flowers give way to single-seeded wafer-like samaras (each tiny seed is surrounded by a flattened circular papery wing) that mature in fall. Elliptic to ovate, shiny dark green leaves (to 3” long) have small teeth. Leaves typically turn an undistinguished dull yellow in fall, but sometimes produce more interesting yellows or reddish-purples. One of the most ornamental features of this tree is its mottled bark. On mature trees, bark flakes to reveal patches of gray, cream, orange, brown and green.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means small leaf in reference to the small leaves of this species.","Problems
 Chinese elm has good resistance to Dutch elm disease, a fatal fungal disease spread by airborne bark beetles. It also has good resistance to Japanese beetle and elm leaf beetle. Occasional disease problems include wilts, rots, cankers and leaf spots. Branches tend to break when stressed with snow, ice or wind. This species should not be confused with the much inferior Siberian elm, Ulmus pumila, which is often referred to as Chinese elm.","Garden Uses

 Yucca brevifolia, commonly known as Joshua tree, is a large, slow-growing, evergreen, tree form yucca native only to the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. It is found growing at elevations between 1,600-7,200' on open, rocky grasslands where they visually dominate the landscape. Mature individuals usually reach around 15-30' tall (sometimes to 50' or more) with an open, rounded canopy of equal width. The average lifespan of a Joshua tree is estimated at 150 years, but older trees exceeding 300 years old have been recorded. Younger plants lack the distinctive branching of older specimens. The stiff, narrow, tapered leaves (between 6-14"" long and 0.25-0.5"" wide) have terminal spines and small serrations along the margins. The foliage forms rosettes on the ends of the branches, and desiccated leaves remain on the plant covering the trunk and stems. The creamy white, round to ovate flowers (up to 2"" long and 1"" wide) are borne on terminal panicles (up to 20"" long). Light green seedpods (up to 4"" long) mature on the tree in clusters. In their native habitat, Joshua trees are an important source of food and shelter for wildlife. Many birds utilize the branches for nesting and perching. These include cactus wrens, northern flickers, and American kestrels. A single moth species called the yucca moth pollinates the flowers. Small mammals such as antelope squirrels and kangaroo rats eat the seeds. Joshua trees were also used by the Cahullia people of inland southern California as a source of food and fibers.Genus name comes from the Carbi name for manihot, also called cassava or yuca, which is not closely related but has similarly enlarged root structures.The specific epithet brevifolia means ""short leaves"", in reference to the length of the foliage relative to other yuccas.According to commonly held legend, the name Joshua tree was given by Mormon settlers and refers to the biblical tale of Joshua guiding the Israelites in the battle for Ai with an outstretched arm.","Problems

 Corn is a warm weather crop and should not be planted until the soil warms up to 60° F. It is one of the taller home garden crops, so locate it where it will not shade out other crops. Plant in full sun, in fertile, well-drained soil. Several rules apply to insure an adequate corn crop:
 1. Corn is wind pollinated, and to insure adequate pollination, sow seeds in several rows to form a square, or on hills with several plants in a circle. A minimum of 12 or more plants is usually necessary. Do not plant in one long row.
 2. Corn is a heavy feeder and must have ample nitrogen and water at all times, but water the soil, not the plant or pollination could suffer. 
 3. Corn roots do not tolerate disturbance well, so when thinning corn, cut the excess sprouts instead of pulling them. Do the same with nearby weeds and after corn is established mulch to reduce weeds rather than cultivating around their roots and damaging them.
 4. Some sweet corns can be adversely affected by cross pollination from other corn varieties, so follow cultivar label directions precisely to avoid pollen contamination from other corn.
 5. Time of harvest is important for some sweet corns, so follow harvest directions carefully for the particular variety you are growing. Hard corns need to dry on the stalk, so harvest time is not a particular issue for them.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Today, botanists generally agree that a wild grass, teosinte (Zea mexicana) is the ancestor of modern corn, originating by human selection sometime between 13,000 and 6,000 BC. Teosinte can ‘pop’ just like today’s popcorn varieties, it shares a similar life cycle with corn, and is easily crossbred, indicating significant genetic similarities with corn. Archeological excavations in Southern Mexico have revealed maize cobs (radiocarbon dated at around 5,000 BC) with features intermediate between wild teosinte and maize. By 3,000 BC, while Mesoamericans had domesticated a number of other food plants as well, maize appeared to be of increasing importance. With other domesticated plants, maize permitted more and larger permanent settlements and provided an important element in the subsequent cultural flowering in later Mesoamerica.
 

 Columbus’ is credited with bringing maize to Spain on his return voyage in 1493. Its cultivation spread quickly in the early 1500s, and fairly quickly reached worldwide distribution, achieving status as one of the most climatically adaptable members of the grass family. While there are hundreds of corn varieties today, virtually all fall under six major categories: (1) sweet corn, (2) popcorn, (3) genetic dwarf of midget corn, (4) broom corn, a decorative corn grown for long fibrous tassels, (5) dent corn, the principle hard corn grown for animal consumption, and (6) multi-colored flint or Indian corn. Today, corn is one of the world’s three most important cereal crops for human and domestic animal consumption.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another cereal.Specific epithet comes from the Mexican vernacular name for maize.","Problems
 The most common pests include corn borers, flea beetles, and cutworms. Animal pests can be serious once ears develop. Clean garden practices, crop rotation, and planting resistant strains are generally the best defense.","Garden Uses

Plants are not winter hardy to St. Louis where they should be dug in fall and overwintered indoors. For the St. Louis climate, bulbs should be planted 2-3” deep and 3-4” apart in spring in full sun to light shade. Best performance is in full sun. After bloom, plants go dormant. In fall before first frost, dig, dry and store bulbs for winter in a cool, frost-free location in a medium such as peat or vermiculite that is given minimal moisture.

 Zephyranthes candida, commonly called rain lily, is a bulbous perennial that is native to the Rio de la Plata region of South America. In the wild, plants often burst into bloom immediately following periods of significant rain, hence the common name. Crocus-like, 1-2”, white flowers, sometimes blushed with pink, bloom singly atop upright stems rising 4-10” tall above a tuft of outward-spreading, narrow, grass-like, green leaves. Bloom appears in late summer to early fall.Genus name comes from the Greek words zephyros meaning the west wind and anthos meaning a flower because it is native of the Western hemisphere.Specific epithet means pure white or shining.","Problems

 Abies balsamea, commonly called balsam fir, is native to moist woods and bottomlands from Labrador to Alberta south to northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, New England, New York and further south in the Appalachians to Virginia. It is a primary component of the boreal forest that stretches across Canada. This is an aromatic, symmetrical, narrow, pyramidal to conical evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown. It typically grows to 50-70' (less frequently to 90') tall and to 15-25' wide. It appears, albeit in a diminished shrubby form, as far north as the timber line. Resinous branches are densely clad with flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1"" long). Needles are unstalked with circular bases and are white-banded beneath. Smooth gray-brown bark (greenish when young but brown and scaly on older trees) is covered with blisters which contain a sticky aromatic resin. Cylindrical seed cones (to 2-4"" long) appear at the crown. Cones are purple when young. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches. Cones disintegrate (scales drop) after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet refers to the fragrant quality of the tree.","Problems

 Best grown in rich, medium moisture, slightly acidic, sandy/gravelly, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Established trees tolerate some soil dryness, but best performance usually comes with moist soils. Trees generally grow poorly in heavy clay soils. This tree thrives in areas with long winters followed by cool summer climates, and it usually does not grow well in the heat and humidity south of USDA Zone 7. It is, however, considered to be the best of the firs for tolerating the growing conditions of the Midwest.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Abies concolor, commonly called white fir or concolor fir, is primarily native to mountain slopes (3000-9000 feet in elevation) in the western U.S., including the southern Cascades and Sierras from Oregon to southern California and the Rockies from southern Idaho to Arizona and New Mexico. In the wild, it typically grows to 80-130’ tall, but on residential landscapes in the Midwest will more typically grow to 40-70’ tall with a spread to 20-30’. This is a narrow conical conifer with a straight trunk, spire-like crown and branching to the base. Upper branches tend to grow upward, but the lower branches tend to recline. With age, crowns flatten and lower branching begins to disappear. Soft, flattened, pale blue-green needles (to 2 1/2” long) have uniform coloration on both surfaces (specific epithet is in reference to this). Slightly barrel-shaped cones (to 3-6” long) are most often yellowish-green, maturing to brown or purple. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches. Trees may not produce cones and seeds for up to the first 40 years. Bark is ash-gray and smooth, but will furrow with age.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet means the same color throughout.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include balsam woolly adelgid, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.

 Best grown in rich, consistently moist, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun, but appreciates some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Likes moist cool locations, but, unlike most other species of fir, does respectably well in the hot and humid weather conditions of the deep South. Tolerates heavy clay soils. New growth in April is susceptible to damage from late spring frosts.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Abies firma, commonly called momi fir or Japanese fir, is a large, aromatic, conical-pyramidal, needled evergreen conifer that typically grows to 100-150’ tall in its native habitat. It is likely to mature to a much smaller height (to 40-60’ tall) in cultivation in the U.S. Branches on younger trees are ascending, but become more horizontal with age. This fir is native to hills and mountain slopes in central to southern Japan from near sea level to about 6,000’ where it grows in a variety of locations on both dry and moist sites. It is the most widely distributed fir in Japan where it is considered to be an important timber tree (flooring, crates, and paper pulp). 
 

 Needles (to 1 1.5” long) are strongly two ranked, appearing like a 2-sided comb, forming a wide V shape on the lower twigs. Needles on young trees are tipped by two sharp prickles at the apex. Scaly, rough, fissured bark is gray, but becomes corky as it darkens with age. Flowers appear in April-May. Conical seed cones (to 3.5 to 5” long) emerge green in spring, but mature to yellowish-brown and are erect and showy throughout summer. As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis. Much smaller cylindrical pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to the firm needles.Momi is the Japanese word for fir.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale.

 Abies fraseri, commonly called Fraser fir, is native to a very small area of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee extending into the southwestern corners of Virginia and West Viginia. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 4500’ to 6900’. It is the only fir that is indigenous to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although rare in nature, Fraser fir is one of the most popular Christmas trees sold in commerce today, and is commonly grown in tree farms for that purpose. This is a narrow, pyramidal, evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown. It grows to 30-50’ tall over time with a spread of 10-25’. It is very similar to balsam fir (Abies balsamea), the primary difference being in the bracts of the cone scales. Flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1” long) are white-banded beneath. Needles are densely borne on resinous stems. Resin blisters may appear on the bark, giving rise to a regional common name of she-balsam for this tree. Seed cones are purple with conspicuously protruding bracts. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet and common name honor John Fraser (1750-1811), Scottish botanist and plant collector, who discovered this plant and introduced it to Britain.","Problems

 Abies grandis, commonly called grand fir, is a large, evergreen fir with a spire crown in youth that typically rounds into a multiple-leadered dome with age. It is native to moist coastal bottomlands and alpine slopes from sea level to 6000’ in elevation in the Pacific Northwest from southwestern British Columbia south to northern California and in a disjunct population in the Rocky Mountains from southeastern British Columbia to central Idaho and far northwestern Montana. It will grow to 200-250’ tall with a 4-6’ trunk diameter in Pacific coniferous forests and alpine slopes in coastal areas west of the cascades (greatest height is in coniferous rain forests on the Olympic peninsula of Washington), but to 130-160’ with a 2-4’ trunk diameter in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and in the Rocky Mountains.  This is one of the tallest firs in the world, hence the common name.  
 

 Smooth gray bark develops ridges and furrows as it ages to brown. Flat needles (to 2 1/2” long) are shiny dark green above with two white stomatal lines beneath. Needles have blunt to slightly notched tips. Needles emit a balsamy, tangerine-like aroma when crushed, hence the additional common name of stinking fir for this tree.

It will grow to 200-250’ tall with a 4-6’ trunk diameter in Pacific coniferous forests and alpine slopes in coastal areas west of the cascades (greatest height is in coniferous rain forests on the Olympic peninsula of Washington), but to 130-160’ with a 2-4’ trunk diameter in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and in the Rocky Mountains.  This is one of the tallest firs in the world, hence the common name.  
 

 Smooth gray bark develops ridges and furrows as it ages to brown. Flat needles (to 2 1/2” long) are shiny dark green above with two white stomatal lines beneath. Needles have blunt to slightly notched tips. Needles emit a balsamy, tangerine-like aroma when crushed, hence the additional common name of stinking fir for this tree. Cylindrical seed cones (to 4.5” long) stand upright above the needles near the tips of the upper branches, emerging green in spring, but maturing to yellowish-brown sometimes tinged blue-gray to purple. Oblong pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils under the needles. Pollen cones are pale yellow. As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to large tree size.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. The balsam woolly adelgid is a significant problem in some areas. Additional potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, tussock moths, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Potential disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight.","Garden Uses

 Acacia koa, commonly known as koa, is a large, fast-growing, evergreen tree of the pea family that is native to the Hawaiian Islands where it typically matures to 50-80’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with a dense broad-spreading crown. It is usually found in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 300’ to 7000’ on the larger Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and Hawaii). It is the second most common tree in the Hawaiian Islands.  
 

 Mature trees have stiff, dull green, sickle-shaped, evergreen phyllodes (to 6” long and 1” wide) rather than leaves. Phyllodes are modified leaf stems that function as leaves. The true leaves of this tree (each with 12 to 15 paired, twice compound, pea-like leaflets) are only found on juvenile saplings. Pale yellow flowers with globose heads (each to 3/8” in diameter) bloom in axillary racemes over the outer part of the crown. Bloom time depends upon a number of factors including elevation, weather conditions and soil moisture. Flowers may appear year round in some locations or late winter to early summer in others. Flowers give way to thin, flat, seed pods (about 3-7” long and 1” wide) which mature to brown. Each pod contains around 12 seeds. 
 

 Koa is the best known timber tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Early Hawaiians made long dugout canoes from the wood of tall trees. Wood is currently used for a variety of other purposes including furniture, cabinets, veneers, wood carvings, musical instruments and picture frames. Timber from this tree is sometimes called Hawaiian mahogany in honor of its decorative wood (beautifully grained in shades of red, golden brown and brown). It is one of the most expensive woods in the world today (low supply translates into high cost). Most commercial harvest of Koa trees is currently limited to the island of Hawaii.

 Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor dry ones. Intolerant of shade.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Acer negundo, commonly known as box elder, is a suckering, fast-growing, weak-wooded, medium-sized, deciduous tree that typically grows 30-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with an irregular rounded crown. It is widely distributed throughout the U.S. except in Alaska and Hawaii. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams, river flood plains and low woods (Steyermark). Although it is a maple and produces the familiar maple fruits (paired samaras), it differs from most maples by having odd-pinnate compound leaves (each with 3-5 toothed leaflets) and by being dioecious (separate male and female trees). Leaves with three leaflets are most common, and these resemble poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Leaves are light to medium green, turning an undistinguished yellow in fall. Greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendant clusters in spring on separate male and female trees. Flowers are not showy. Female flowers give way to fruits (samaras) which mature in fall and often persist on the tree well into winter. Fruiting can be abundant.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Sanskrit and Bengali word nirgundi, which was used as negundo in the naming of Vitex negundo and later for this maple that has a leaf similar to that of Vitex negundo.The name box elder (sometimes boxelder) is in reference to a use of the wood for making crates and boxes and the supposed similarity of the leaves to those of elder (Sambucus). Leaves also resemble those of some ashes, hence the additional common name of ash-leaved maple.","Problems
 This tree is a host for boxelder bugs, which do not harm the tree but can be a significant nuisance to homeowners if the tree is located near the home. Also susceptible to borers. Anthracnose, powdery mildew and canker are occasional disease problems. Weak-wooded branches may break in high winds or from the weight of ice/snow, sometimes severely damaging the shape of the tree.","Garden Uses
 Could be used as a shade tree. Generally recommended only for difficult corners of the landscape where other trees of superior ornamental value will not grow or in cold northern climates such as North Dakota where many deciduous shade trees are hard to grow. Male trees are generally considered to be superior landscape plants to female trees because they lack the messy flowers and somewhat unsightly seed clusters of the female trees.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

 Acer platanoides, commonly called Norway maple, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in urban areas throughout much of the U.S. It is a medium-sized deciduous shade tree typically growing 40-50’ tall with a dense, symmetrical, rounded crown. Leaves (to 7” across) have five sharply pointed lobes and resemble those of sugar maple. Leaf stems exude a milky sap when cut. Fall color is usually an unremarkable yellow. Small yellow flowers in erect clusters (corymbs) appear in spring before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired seeds with horizontally spreading wings (samaras to 2” long).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means resembling platanus (sycamore), which is somewhat curious since the leaves of Norway maple do not really bear that much resemblance to sycamores.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt which is usually fatal. Shallow root system can crack or heave nearby driveways or sidewalks. Shallow surface roots can interfere with turf. Bark is susceptible to sunscald and cracking (frost cracks) in winter, particularly on younger trees.

 Acer rubrum, commonly called red maple, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Eastern North America from Quebec to Minnesota south to Florida and eastern Texas. It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a rounded to oval crown. It grows faster than Norway and sugar maples, but slower than silver maple. In northern states, red maple usually occurs in wet bottomland, river flood plains and wet woods, but in Missouri it typically frequents drier, rocky upland areas. Emerging new growth leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit and fall color are red or tinged with red. Quality of red fall color on species plants is variable. Leaves (to 2-5"" long) have 3 principal triangular lobes (sometimes 5 lobes with the two lower lobes being largely suppressed). Lobes have toothed margins and pointed tips. Leaves are medium to dark green above and gray green below. Flowers on a given tree are primarily male or female or monoecious and appear in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves. Fruit is a two-winged samara.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet of rubrum meaning red is everywhere in evidence: red flowers in dense clusters in late March to early April (before the leaves appear), red fruit (initially reddish, two-winged samara), reddish stems and twigs, red buds, and, in the fall, excellent orange-red foliage color.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids, leafhoppers, borers, scale and caterpillars. Verticillium wilt attacks the vascular system and can be fatal.

 Acer saccharinum commonly known as silver maple gets its name from the silvery undersides of its leaves. This is one of the largest deciduous trees native to Missouri, typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a rounded open spreading crown. It is native to eastern and central North America where it typically occurs in moist to wet, sometimes mucky, often poorly drained soils on floodplains, along the edges of streams and rivers and in low woods. It is a fast-growing, somewhat graceful tree that formerly was a very popular urban landscape selection for lawns and streets, but has more recently fallen somewhat out of favor because of the proclivity of its weak-wooded limbs to split when stressed by high winds or ice/snow. Polygamous greenish yellow flowers bloom in clusters in early spring (March) before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired samaras (to 2” long) that mature in late spring. Bark is gray to brownish gray. Mature tree trunks and limbs develop a shaggy appearance as the bark develops long thin flaky scales that exfoliate at the ends. Deeply 5-lobed light green leaves (to 6” across) have silvery undersides. Fall color is usually unremarkable. Tree sap is sweet, hence the species name which comes from the Latin word for sugar, but syrups made therefrom are greatly inferior to those made from sugar maple (Acer saccharum).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose and canker. Also susceptible to scale and borers. As with many fast growing trees, silver maple has weak brittle branches that are susceptible to breaking in high winds or when coated with ice/snow in winter.

 Acer saccharum commonly known as sugar maple is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which will typically grow 40' to 80' tall (sometimes to 100') with a dense, rounded crown. This tree is a main component of the Eastern U.S. hardwood forest and is one of the trees which is most responsible for giving New England its reputation for spectacular fall color. Medium green leaves (3-6"" wide with 3-5 lobes) turn yellow-orange in autumn, sometimes with considerable color variations. Fruit is the familiar two-winged samara.

 Best grown in lean, dry to medium, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Plants also tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. If grown ornamentally, plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens.

 Best grown in lean, dry to medium, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Plants also tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. If grown ornamentally, plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens.

 Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Plants perform well in both boggy conditions (including shallow standing water to 3-4” deep) and consistently moist garden soils. Never allow soils to dry out. Scorched leaf tips and withering leaves are often the first signs of drying soils. In water gardens, plants are typically planted in containers with water covering the crowns or in wet soils at the water’s edge. Plants appreciate some relief from hot summer sun (e.g., afternoon shade or filtered sun) when grown in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Plants will slowly naturalize by spreading rhizomes, but are not considered to be invasive. If grown in containers sunk below the water surface, plants will not spread. Plants are not considered to be reliably winter hardy in the northern parts of USDA Zone 5.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Acorus gramineus is commonly called grassy-leaved sweet flag. It is native to wetland areas of China, Japan, Korea, India, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines. It is a semi-evergreen, marginal aquatic perennial that features a grass-like tuft of narrow, linear leaf blades (1/4“ wide) that fan outward to 6-12” tall. Tiny, insignificant, yellow-green flowers bloom from spring to early summer on lateral, sedge-like flower spikes (spadixes to 2-4"" long). Flowers give way to very tiny, reddish, fleshy berries. Tufts will slowly spread over time by rhizomes to form a dense ground cover. Plants thrive in wet soils and are commonly grown in water gardens and boggy areas for foliage accent or ground cover purposes. Although it looks like a grass and its common name suggests a grassy appearance, grassy-leaved sweet flag is not a member of the grass family. Originally it was assigned to the arum family (which includes calla lily and jack-in-the-pulpit), but recently it has been transferred from arum to its own family called Acoraceae. Transfer from the arum family was in part done because plants in the genus Acorus do not have true spathes as are typically found in arum family members. Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoron used for Acorus calamus and Iris pseuodacorus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning grass.Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Scorch will occur if soils are not kept consistently moist to wet.","Garden Uses
 Mass as a ground cover in small areas of water gardens, along streams or ponds, bogs or in moist open woodland gardens. Helps control erosion on water banks.

 Actinidia arguta, commonly known as hardy kiwi or tara vine, is a deciduous, fast-growing, twining woody vine that is typically grown for its attractive foliage and edible fruit. It is native to woodlands, mountain forests, streamsides and moist locations in eastern Asia, China and Japan. It grows to 25-30' or more, but growth is often so rampant that this vine, in its native habitat, may climb to as much as 100' into large trees. Broad-ovate to elliptic deep green leaves (3-5"" long) emerge in spring, scented greenish-white flowers (to 3/4"" long) bloom in June and edible grape-sized smooth-skinned fruits (to 1 1/4"" long) mature in September-October. Species plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants), with at least one male pollinator needed for fruit set on female vines. It tastes similar to, though slightly sweeter than, its larger-fruited relative, the true kiwi, Actinidia deliciosa, which can not be grown north of Zone 8.Genus name comes from the Greek word aktis meaning ray in reference to how the plant growth radiates like the spokes of a wheel.Specific epithet means sharply toothed or notched in reference to the toothed leaves.","Problems

 Grow in consistently moist, neutral to alkaline soils in part shade to full shade. Plants in the wild will sprawl from wet limestone rocks. Native Missouri growing conditions are difficult to duplicate in home gardens. Notwithstanding the U.S. growing range of this plant, it may not be reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 5.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Adiantum capillus-veneris, commonly called southern maidenhair fern, is a deciduous, clumping fern with a drooping habit that grows to 12-18” tall and slowly spreads by short creeping rhizomes. It features bipinnate to tripinnate fronds with wiry, black stems that are distinctively arching to pendent. Small pinnae (each to 1/2” long) are fan-shaped, having wedge-shaped bases and irregular lobing at the apex. Sori (spores) appear in summer on the reflexed pinnae undermargins. In Missouri, this fern is typically found in moist ledges and crevices of dolomite bluffs and on boulders along streams and rivers in the Ozark Mountains and adjacent areas (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to northern maidenhair fern (Adiantum pedatum), except among other things its fronds are unforked. Soft delicate finely textured foliage is attractive in woodland areas. This fern is native throughout the world in tropical to temperate regions including South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. In the U. S., it is uncommonly found throughout the southern states north to California, South Dakota and Ohio.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning hair (capillus) of Venus (veneris) as reflected by the sometimes used common name of Venus maidenhair fern for this species.","Problems

 Grow in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Best in bright but sun-dappled or filtered light in sheltered locations with good air circulation. Part shade is better than full shade. Container plants grown as houseplants should be placed near sunny windows but not in direct sun. Foliage may scorch in full sun but growth will lose vigor in too much shade. Water freely and evenly, but avoid overwatering. Soils should never be allowed to dry out. Mist foliage to increase humidity. Best indoor daytime temperatures are around 70 degrees F., dipping to 60 degrees F. at night.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as rough maidenhair fern, is an evergreen to deciduous fern featuring bipinnate to tripinnate fronds (each to 14” long). It typically grows in an arching foliage clump to 12-18” tall, spreading over time by wiry, short-creeping rhizomes to form small colonies. Each frond is divided into narrow pinnae stemming from the center stem of the frond, with each pinna being clad with rough textured, oblong to fan-shaped, medium to dark green pinnules (leaf segments to 1/2” long). Each pinnule has sori (spores) which appear in summer on the undermargins of the pinnules (6-14 sori per pinnule). This fern is native to shaded rainforest and open rocky sites, often found along rivers and banks, in Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands, tropical Asia and Africa. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the southern U. S. (Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Hawaii). This fern tends to be deciduous when grown outdoors in temperate conditions of USDA Zones 8-10, but is semi-evergreen to evergreen when grown in semi-tropical to tropical conditions or indoors as a houseplant. Juvenile foliage emerges showy pink in sharp contrast to the leathery dark green mature foliage, hence the sometimes used additional common name of rosy maidenhair fern. Pink fronds gradually mature to dark green or bronze green. Common name of rough maidenhair fern is in reference to its rough-textured foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin hispus meaning hair in reference to the fronds having minutely hairy stems.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in sun or shade. Perhaps best in part shade in the St. Louis area. Foliage will often scorch in hot, dry, full sun conditions. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Flower heads may be removed to prevent self-seeding and to maintain appearance of the ground cover. Any unvariegated shoots which appear should also be removed as they tend to be more vigorous and can quickly take over a planting. If foliage declines in summer, plantings may be sheared by mowing on a high setting to remove the unsightly leaves and to stimulate new foliage growth. Spreads by underground stems (rhizomes) and can be quite aggressive. If not grown in self-contained areas, mechanical barriers may need to be installed to prevent unwanted spread of plants. Commonly sold by nurseries in flats for covering large areas.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called goutweed (in its variegarted form) is one of the most popular ground covers for quickly covering large areas. Will rapidly form a continuous mound of attractive foliage typically growing to 8"" tall with an indefinite spread. Unfortunately, once it gets going, it acts like the proverbial snowball going downhill and can be difficult to contain. Individual leaflets (to 3"" long) are oval and serrated. Tiny white flowers appear in flat-topped, dill-like inflorescences (umbels) which are typical of the parsley/carrot family. Flowers appear above the foliage in May-June, but are not particularly attractive and are often sheared off by gardeners where practicable.Genus name comes from the Greek words aix meaning a goat and podion meaning a little foot. Thought to cure gout.Common name is in reference to a former use of the plant in the treatment of gout. Also commonly called Bishop's weed in reference to the purported resemblance of the leaflet shape to that of a bishop's miter.'Variegatum' has basal foliage that is light green with creamy white margins. It is less aggressive than the species but plants may revert back to the species with all green leaves and greater vigor. To retain the variegated form, remove any plants that revert.","Problems
 Leaf blight is a somewhat common disease which is particularly troublesome in hot and humid summer climates. Foliage often declines by mid-summer to the point where mowing on a high setting is needed to revitalize a planting. Aggressive spreading tendencies must be considered prior to siting this plant in the landscape.","Garden Uses
 Avoid use of this plant in any mixed planting with other perennials such as in a rock garden or border. Best in a pure, contained planting (surrounded by natural or installed barriers) where it can be allowed to grow and spread solely as a ground cover.

 Agastache foeniculum, commonly known as anise hyssop, is an upright, clump-forming perennial of the mint family that is native to parts of the upper Midwest and Great Plains (Wisconsin to Ontario west to British Columbia and south to Colorado). It is typically found in prairies, dry upland forested areas, plains and fields. It grows to 2-4' tall. It is noted for its mid- to late summer bloom of lavender to purple flowers in terminal spikes and its anise-scented foliage. Square stems are clad with ovate to broad-lanceolate dull green leaves (to 4"" long) with toothed margins. Flowers appear in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) which are densely packed into showy, cylindrical, terminal flower spikes (3-6"" long). Gaps sometimes appear along the flower spike. Individual, tiny, tubular, two-lipped flowers (each to 1/3"" long) have no fragrance. Flowers are attractive to bees (good nectar plant), hummingbirds and butterflies. Aromatic leaves can be used to make herbal teas or jellies. Seeds can be added to cookies or muffins.

This agave may be propagated from seed or offsets.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Agave americana is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to Mexico. It has been introduced and has naturalized in a number of tropical areas around the world. Each plant typically forms a large, evergreen basal rosette of thick, succulent, lanceolate, gray-green leaves. Each rosette typically matures over time to as much as 6' tall by 8-10' wide. Each leaf has a waxy bloom, spiny tip, and sharp marginal spines. This plant is also well-known for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes. Plants are monocarpic (bloom only once and then die). Common name of century plant suggests the plant will live 100 years before flowering. In reality, outdoor plants typically bloom between the 10th and 25th years.  Indoor plants rarely flower. When an outdoor plant blooms, it sends up a single, stout, erect flowering stalk from the center of the basal rosette of leaves to 15-30' tall or more. The flowering stalk resembles a narrow telephone pole with horizontal branching near the top. Greenish-yellow flowers (each to 3-4"" long) bloom in panicles at the branch ends. Suckers/offsets root at the base of each rosette over time, often forming a colony of new plants. Once a plant flowers and dies, the offsets around the base of the plant continue to grow.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet means of America.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Agave weevil can be troublesome. Slugs and snails may damage foliage.  Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.","Garden Uses
 Where winter hardy, this agave serves as an interesting tropical accent or specimen.  It is a large and showy plant for the landscape. It needs a large space in which to grow.

 Annual. Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers rich soils with good drainage and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Plants tend to wilt quickly if soils are allowed to dry out. Tolerates light shade, and prefers some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. In climates where powdery mildew is a problem, avoid overhead watering and site in areas with good air circulation. Ageratums are easily grown from seed. Seed may be started indoors in late winter and transplanted outdoors after threat of frost has passed. Seed may also be sown directly in the garden after last frost date, however flowering season will be shorter (late summer to frost). Seeds are tiny and difficult to work with, particularly for direct outdoor plantings. For gardeners who do not wish to use seed, live plants are available from many nurseries in cell packs/six packs and flats. Space taller varieties 12” apart and shorter varieties 6” apart. Spent flowers will fall to the ground as they fade to be replaced by new bloom throughout the growing season. Prompt deadheading of the faded flowers is not necessary, but keeps a planting tidy and tends to promote a better uninterrupted bloom. Plants may not bloom to frost in some hot summer climates, but usually do so in cooler ones. First autumn frost will kill most if not all plants, at which point they may be removed from the garden.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Ageratum houstonianum, commonly called floss flower, is a frost-tender annual of the aster family that provides continuous bloom for beds, gardens or containers from late spring to frost. Features fluffy flowers (basically asters with ray flowers absent) in flattened to slightly rounded clusters atop compact, mounded plants generally ranging from 4” to 18” tall. Some taller varieties (e.g., the triploid ‘Blue Horizon’) are more erect and grow to as much as 30” tall. Species flowers are medium blue, however many cultivars are available in commerce in various shades of blue, pink, red, white and bicolor. Leaves are typically rounded, cordate-at-the-base, hairy, slightly quilted and soft green. Taller varieties make good cut flowers.Genus name presumably comes from the Greek a meaning not and geras meaning old age because the flowers hold their color for a long time.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids and whiteflies. Powdery mildew is an occasional problem, particularly in hot and humid climates where soils are kept on the dry side and air circulation is poor. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Taller plants usually benefit from some support.","Garden Uses

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils with good drainage, but tolerates moderately dry ones. Will grow in full shade, but best foliage color usually occurs in part-sun locations (at least 3-4 hours of sun per day). Provide good air circulation in hot and humid areas where crown rot is a problem. Divide plants if they become overcrowded. This low-growing bugleweed will spread in the garden by stolons (reptans means creeping) to form an attractive, mat-like ground cover. Plants may be cut back to the ground after flowering, if necessary, to rejuvenate the foliage. Large plantings may be mowed on a high mower setting to remove spent flower spikes and to tidy the appearance of the planting. Space plants 6-9” apart for prompt cover. On variegated forms promptly remove any non-variegated leaves that may appear.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Ajuga reptans, commonly called bugleweed, is a dense, rapidly spreading, mat-forming ground cover which features shiny, dark green leaves. Whorls of tiny, blue-violet flowers appear in mid to late spring on spikes rising above the foliage to 10"". Cultivars of this species feature leaves with more interesting and varied foliage color. When in full flower, large clumps of bugleweed can produce a striking display. Dense foliage will choke out weeds. Not particularly tolerant of foot traffic.Genus name origin is unclear.Specific epithet means creeping.","Problems
 Crown rot can be a problem, particularly in the humid conditions of the deep South and in heavy soils. Avoid planting in wet, heavy soils, provide good air circulation and divide when clumps become overcrowded. Also avoid planting near perennial beds or lawns where its spreading nature could pose removal problems.","Garden Uses
 Primary use is as a ground cover. Will fill in large, shady areas where lawns are difficult to establish. May also be planted on banks or slopes, under trees or around shrubs. Can be planted over spring bulbs such as snowdrops (Galanthus). Avoid planting adjacent to lawn areas since little islands of ajuga may start appearing in the grass.

 Easily grown in most soils. Best in well-drained sandy loams with regular moisture in full sun to part shade. Prefers full sun, but tolerates close to full shade. Also tolerates some drought. Needs a support structure upon which to grow unless grown as a ground cover. For best fruit production, plant more than one vine to facilitate good cross-pollination. Many experts recommend hand-pollination. Prune as needed in late spring after flowers appear. May be cut to the ground to renovate. Foliage is semi-evergreen in warm winter climates. Grows rapidly and can suffocate shrubs or other vegetation if not kept in check.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Akebia quinata, commonly called fiveleaf akebia, is a deciduous, twining, woody vine that rapidly grows to 20-40’. It produces compound palmate leaves, each with 5 elliptic to oblong-obovate leaflets (1-3” long) which are dark green above and glaucous below. Small chocolate-purple flowers bloom in drooping axillary racemes in spring. Flowers are monoecious, with both staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers appearing in the same raceme. Flowers are often hidden by the foliage, but are quite interesting on close inspection and have a pleasant fragrance. Flowers give way to sausage-shaped, violet fruit pods (to 4” long) which split open in fall to reveal small black seeds imbedded in a whitish pulp. The whitish pulp is edible. Native to China, Korea and Japan, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized in parts of the eastern U.S. Sometimes commonly called chocolate vine.Genus name is the Latinized version of the Japanese name akebi for these twining shrubs.Specific epithet means having five parts, in reference to the five-leaflet palmate leaves.","Problems

Not reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 5.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Albizia julibrissin, commonly called mimosa or silk tree, is a fast-growing, small to medium sized, deciduous tree that typically grows in a vase shape to 20-40’ tall with a spreading, often umbrella-like crown. It is native to Asia (Iran to Japan). It has been widely planted in the U. S. as an ornamental and has escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the southeastern U. S. and California. In the wild, it is typically seen growing in vacant lots, waste areas, clearings, wood margins, fields and along roads. It can be quite invasive in watersheds where water currents carry and distribute the seeds downstream. It is noted for its bipinnate compound dark green leaves (to 20” long). Each leaf has 10-25 pinnae, with each pinnae having 40-60 tiny leaflets (to 1/4” long). Leaves have a fern-like appearance. Fluffy, pink, powder puff flowerheads cover the tree with a long summer bloom. Flowers are fragrant and attractive to bees. Flowers give way to flat bean-like seed pods (to 7” long) which persist into winter. Sensitive leaflets close up when touched and at night. Leaflets fall to the ground after frost, producing no fall color.Genus name honors Filippo degli Albizzia, 18th century Italian naturalist, who introduced the genus to Italy in 1749.Specific epithet comes from the Persian word gul-ebruschin meaning floss silk in reference to the flowers.","Problems
 Wilt is becoming a serious problem in many areas. Also susceptible to mimosa web worm. Self-seeding can produce numerous seedlings. Falling leaves, flowers and seed pods can pose significant clean-up problems if trees are planted near homes. Weak wooded limbs are susceptible to damage from strong winds and ice/snow.","Garden Uses

 Allium cernuum, commonly called nodding wild onion, is a Missouri native plant which occurs primarily in rocky soils on glades, bluff edges, open woods and slopes in the Ozark region of the State. Plants typically grow 12-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12” tall) and tiny bell-shaped, pink to lilac pink (occasionally white) flowers which appear in loose, nodding clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Wild nodding onion is distinguished from most other native alliums by the fact that its scapes crook sharply downward at the top just below the flower so that the flower umbel nods (hence the common name). Blooms in summer. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, nodding onion is not generally considered to be of culinary value today.

 Allium sativum, commonly called garlic, is a bulbous perennial of the onion family. It is native to the Mediterranean area. Foliage consists of aromatic, linear, flattened, grass-like green leaves. In some varieties, a central scape topped by an umbel of pinkish-white flowers rises from each clump of leaves to 18” tall in summer. Garlic is typically grown as an annual in herb and vegetable gardens for its segmented bulbs which are commonly used in cooking.  
 

 Garlic comes in two varieties: hardneck (designated as Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon) and softneck (designated as Allium sativum var. sativum). Hardneck varieties typically produce a flower stalk, with flowers giving way to a seed cap. Each bulb typically contains 4-10 cloves (bulb is smaller but cloves are larger than those of softneck).  Hardneck varieties come in three different types: Rocambole, Poreclain and Purple Stripe. By contrast, softneck garlic plants typically do not produce a flower stalk. They produce bulbs with smaller but more numerous cloves than hardneck garlic plants. Each bulb typically contains 12-20 cloves. Softneck plants are also braidable (bulbs can be braided together into attractive chains by weaving the soft grass-like tops together). Softneck garlic varieties are the ones most often commonly sold in supermarkets because they typically have a much longer shelf life than hardnecks.  Softneck varieties come in two different types: Silverskin and Artichoke.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means cultivated.","Problems

 Easily grown in rich, sandy to gritty, dry to medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Plants form dense, slowly-spreading clumps over time. Plants perform best with consistent moisture during the growing season, but tolerate drought after flowering ends. Plant new bulbs 3-5"" (3 times bulb width) deep and 4-6"" apart in fall. Plants may be grown from seed which is usually sown in fall. Plants will self-seed (sometimes prolifically) in the garden, and if left unchecked will naturalize freely. Deadhead flowers before seed sets to help control any unwanted spread. Bulbs of established plants may be dug, divided and replanted in late summer to early fall after foliage has died down.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Allium sphaerocephalon, commonly called round-headed leak or drumstick allium, is a bulbous perennial that is ornamentally grown for its early summer bloom of rose-purple to pink flower heads. This plant is native throughout Europe to the Caucusus, Iran and northern Africa. Cylindrical, hollow, grassy, gray-green leaves to 14"" long form a foliage clump in spring. In late spring, sturdy slender flowering stems rise to 24-36"" tall topped with egg-shaped flower heads (umbels to 1"" wide) in an impressive early summer bloom (June-July in St. Louis). Each flower head is a tight, dense, clover-like cluster of tiny florets that emerge deep green but mature (top to bottom) to rose-purple. Each flower head displays an interesting bi-color effect as the florets change from green to purple. This species blooms later than most of the alliums. Flower heads resemble the flower heads of some clovers. Flowers lack fragrance. Bulbils sometimes form after flowering. Leaves and bulbs have an onion-like aroma when cut or bruised. Synonymous with and formerly known as Allium sphaerocephalum.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means with a round head.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils. Mildew, rust, leaf spots and thrips may appear. Plants may colonize over time, but are not considered to be invasive.","Garden Uses
 Ornamental onion for rock gardens, beds and borders, cottage gardens, open woodland areas and meadows. Best grown in large groups or massed. May be naturalized. Grows well in containers. Cut flowers are excellent for both fresh cut and dried flower arrangements.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Clethra tomentosa, commonly called summer sweet, is a deciduous shrub that is native to damp woods, swamps, wet marshes and stream banks, often in sandy soils, in the southeastern U.S. from North Carolina to Florida west to Louisiana. It is a rounded, suckering, densely-branched shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ (less frequently to 8’) tall. Young shoots and young leaf surfaces are woolly-tomentose. It is noted for producing a mid to late summer (mid-July to September) bloom of sweetly fragrant white flowers which appear in drooping, narrow panicles (racemes to 2-6"" long). Each inflorescence has 2-4 flowering racemes. Flowers give way to dark brown seed capsules (1/8"" diameter) which may persist into winter.  Mature stems have scaly, dark gray to brownish-black bark. Serrate, obovate to oblong, glossy dark green leaves (to 3-4” long) turn variable but generally attractive shades of yellow to golden brown in fall. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and bees. Semi-evergreen in warm winter climates.  
 

 Clethra tomentosa was formerly listed as Clethra alnifolia var. tomentosum, but has somewhat recently been elevated to separate species status.  On a comparative basis, the characteristics of Clethra alnifolia var. tomentosum which were primarily considered in changing its listing to Clethra tomentosum include: (1) flowers panicles are longer and more drooping, (2) petioles are consistently shorter, (3) new shoots are woolly, (4) styles are shorter and hairy, and (5) overall growth habit is more spreading.Genus name comes from the Greek klethra the name for alder of which the leaves resemble.Specific epithet from Latin means hairy in reference to the hairs found on the leaves and young shoots of this plant.‘Cottondale’ leaves are more tomentose than the species, thus lending a blue-green cast to upper surfaces and a light green cast to leaf undersides.

It more typically reaches 4-8’ tall in the greenhouse and 3-4’ tall as a houseplant. It is commonly called shell ginger because its individual shell pink flowers, particularly when in bud, resemble sea shells and its rhizomes have a ginger-like aroma. It is distinguished from other members of the ginger family by the fact that its flowers droop from the ends of leafy stems rather than rise directly from plant rhizomes. Waxy, light pink flower buds open to tubular flowers with yellow inside lips and red throats. Flowers are fragrant. Flowers appear in drooping racemes (to 1’ long) in summer.

 Amelanchier alnifolia is a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree which may grow to 18' tall. Features showy, 5-petaled, white flowers (to 3/4"" diameter) in compact clusters which appear in early spring (April) before the leaves. Flowers give way to small, round, edible berries which ripen to dark purplish-black in June and resemble blueberries in size, color and taste. Berries may be eaten fresh off the plant or used in jams, jellies and pies. Finely-toothed, oval-rounded leaves are pale to dark green. Foliage turns variable shades of yellow in autumn. The species is commonly called Saskatoon serviceberry or western serviceberry, and some species cultivars have been grown commercially for fruit production.Genus name comes from a French provincial name for Amelanchier ovalis a European plant in this genus.Specific epithet means leaves like the genus Alnus in reference to the similarity of the leaves of this species to common alder (Alnus glutinosa).'Regent' is a compact, deciduous, stoloniferous, early-flowering cultivar which typically grows only 4-6' tall.

 Dill is an annual that is best grown in rich, light, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants are more apt to fall over in part shade. Shelter plants from strong winds. Close-planting, stakes or cages may be used to provide support. Best growth occurs in cool summer climates. Plants appreciate consistent soil moisture. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Plants tend to bolt when conditions remain dry. Sow seed directly in the ground just before the last spring frost date. Seedlings can be difficult to transplant, so seeds are usually not started indoors. Additional seeds may be planted every two weeks until early summer for purposes of extending the time when fresh leaves may be harvested. Dill seed may be harvested by placing the seed heads in paper bags to dry about 2-3 weeks after flowering (this method will also help prevent self-seeding in the garden). In St. Louis, a patch of dill will usually self-seed and produce new plants each spring. Dill may also be grown in large containers (deep roots of dill need deep containers).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Anethum graveolens, commonly called dill, is an annual that is frequently grown in herb, vegetable and flower gardens not only for harvest of its aromatic leaves and seeds, but also for ornamental display of its attractive foliage and flowers. Although native to Asia Minor and the Mediterranean, dill has now been widely planted around the globe, with naturalization having occurred in parts of Europe and North America. Dill typically grows to 3-5' tall on stiff hollow stems clad with aromatic, lacy, delicate, blue-green leaves that are pinnately divided into fine, thread-like segments. Taller plants may flop and need protection from strong winds. Scented, yellow flowers bloom in mid-summer in large, flattened, compound umbels (each to 10"" diameter). Flowers are followed by aromatic seed. Leaves usually have the best flavor around the time when the flowers first open. Although leaves may be dried or frozen for later use, the leaves have by far the best flavor when harvested fresh from the garden. Dill attracts a number of beneficial insects to the garden (e.g., bees, wasps, butterflies, lacewings, tachinid flies, hover flies and lady beetles). Dill is a larval plant for the black swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek name for dill.Common name of dill reportedly comes from the norse word dilla meaning to lull or soothe. In colonial America, dill seeds were sometimes called meetinghouse seeds because they were on occasion given to children to chew during long church services.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Blight and aster yellows can cause significant damage. Watch for aphids and tomato hornworms.","Garden Uses
 Commonly grown in herb gardens, vegetable gardens or flower borders. Also may be grown in containers. Dill leaves add subtle but distinctive flavor to a variety of dishes including fish, vegetables, soups, salads, sauces, breads, and herb butters. Dill seed is more pungent than the leaves and is the primary flavoring in dill pickles. Dill seed is also used in vinegars, sauerkraut and for flavoring root vegetables. Dill seed can be used to make an excellent tea. Flower heads are excellent in dried arrangements.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In the wild, it is a slender tree that will grow to 15-20' tall often with down-curved branching. It grows much smaller in containers. The name soursop is in reference to its large edible fruits which have a slightly acidic or sour taste. This tropical plant is not reliably winter hardy to most of southern Florida, but may be grown in the Florida keys and Puerto Rico. In greenhouses, it typically flowers in summer producing fruits in fall. Each flower (to 2"" long) appears singly on a woody stalk almost anywhere on the tree (twigs, branches or trunk). Each flower has three yellowish-green outer petals and three dull yellow inner petals. Flowers give way to rough-skinned, prickly-textured, oblong fruit (each fruit from 6-12"" long to 4-6"" wide with weight to 8-15 pounds). Fruit pulp is used in ice cream, sherbets or juices. Leathery, egg-shaped, malodorous (when bruised), oblong to oval leaves (to 6"" long) are glossy green above. Plants have been used for various medicinal purposes.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the American Indian (Taino) vernacular name for the cherimoya, soursop or custard-apple.","Problems

 Grow in St. Louis as a houseplant. Use a well-drained, peaty potting mixture with a layer of pot shards at the bottom. Plants need bright light (part or diffused sun in summer), but avoid full sun. In too much shade, plants may not bloom. Bright indirect light in winter is best. Consistent moisture year around. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. Does not require winter dormancy. Prefers high humidity. Regular temperatures in summer and minimum 60F in winter. Frequent repotting (every 2 years) helps rid soils of unabsorbed minerals. Sphagnum moss on soil surface helps cover and keep moist any roots that appear. Insecticides may harm flowers.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Anthurium andraeanum, commonly called flamingo lily or painter’s palette, is native to Columbia and Ecuador. It is an epiphytic evergreen tropical perennial of the Arum family that is most noted for its attractive waxy, palette-shaped, bright red spathes and contrasting dark green foliage. It typically grows to 16” tall. Drooping, heart-shaped, dark green leaves (to 8” long) arise in a clump on long stems from the plant crown and are attractive year around. Each axillary flower (typical arum family) features a creamy yellow spadix enclosed by a large, flat, waxy red spathe (to 6”). Flowers are long-lasting. Flowers may appear throughout the year in optimum growing conditions. Fruits rarely appear on indoor plants.Genus name comes from the Greek words anthos meaning a flower and oura meaning a tail referring to the tail-like spadix.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. When grown outdoors, this tree prefers deep, porous, moderately fertile, reasonably moist soils in full sun. Tolerant of some dry soil conditions however.  Also tolerant of windy conditions.  May be grown from seed sown in moist, sandy, peaty soils, but seed-grown trees typically have widely-spaced tiers of leaves that are less ornamentally attractive than the leaves found on trees raised from terminal cuttings. Best growth generally occurs in sub-tropical regions.  
 

 For indoor use, this tree may be grown in containers or tubs in fertile, porous, sandy, peaty, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in fairly cool conditions (55-65 degrees F). Full sun is normally best for developing compact symmetrical growth, but some light afternoon shade may be needed to avoid possible foliage bleach (yellow tints). As a houseplant, it will generally adapt to the warm, dry atmosphere found in most offices and homes. Consider weekly or biweekly applications of dilute liquid fertilizer from spring through fall. Avoid soils that are too wet or too dry.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Norfolk Island pine is a pyramidal to columnar, coniferous, evergreen tree with a symmetrical form that features whorled, horizontal branches (typically 5 branches per whorl) in tiers radiating outward from a strong, single, upright trunk. Secondary branches in two rows spread horizontally or droop slightly. It is native to Norfolk Island off the coast of Australia where it typically grows on basalt sea cliffs and interior rain forests, sometimes reaching majestic heights of 200’ or more with trunk diameters to 6’ or more. It was discovered on Captain Cook’s second voyage (1772-1775), and was subsequently introduced into cultivation in 1793. It is now widely planted throughout the world in subtropical regions, often in coastal areas. It is common in Hawaii, parts of southern Florida and parts of southern California up the coast to the San Francisco Bay area. 
 

 Needle-like, awl-shaped juvenile leaves (each to 1/2” long) have incurved sharp-pointed ends. Scale-like adult leaves (each to 1/4” long) are lanceolate to ovate-triangular, overlap each other and are closely arranged along the shoots pointing toward the shoot ends. Cylindrical male pollen cones grow to 2” long. Nearly globular, spiny-scaled, female seed cones grow to 3-6” in diameter. 
 

 Norfolk Island Pine is now the most popular species in the genus in North America where it is commonly grown in pots and tubs as a decorative indoor plant. 
 

 In St. Louis, it is grown as a container/tub plant, typically in the 3-6’ tall range. It grows slowly, and in proper growing conditions has a long life. It looks like a pine with horizontal needle-like branches, but it is not part of the pine genus.Genus name comes from the Araucanian Indians of central Chile to whose territory Araucaria is native.Specific epithet comes from Greek meaning variously leaved.","Problems

 Grow in acidic, dry to medium, well-drained, sandy or gritty soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Usually grows well in poor infertile soils. Plants should not be fertilized. Drought tolerant once established. Likes exposed open sites. Best grown in USDA Zones 2-6 (7). Grows poorly in hot and humid summer climates, and is not recommended for planting in most areas south of USDA Zone 7. Difficult to transplant from the wild. Propagate by cuttings from the current season’s growth, by layering, by division (with care because roots dislike disturbance) or species plants by seed.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, known by a large number of common names including common bearberry and kinninnick, is an extremely winter hardy, creeping, slow-growing, prostrate, woody evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-12” tall but spreads over time by flexible branching (roots at the nodes) to 3-6’ wide or more. This is a circumpolar ground-hugger which is native throughout the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. In North America, it is typically found in a variety of locations from Alaska to Newfoundland south through Canada to Virginia, Illinois, South Dakota, New Mexico and central California in a variety of habitats typically including gravelly and/or sandy exposed sites, dry/rocky slopes/outcrops, forest margins and forest clearings. It is primarily confined to cool alpine regions in the more southern parts of its growing range (Appalachians in Virginia, Rockies in New Mexico and Sierras in California).  
 

 Branchlets mature to reddish brown, with papery peeling bark on older twigs. Branchlets are clad with alternate, entire, short-stalked, leathery, rounded-at-the-tip, obovate to spatulate, evergreen dark green leaves (each to 1 1/4” long) which are shiny above but paler beneath. Leaves turn bronze in winter before becoming green again in spring. Miniature, drooping, urn-shaped, white-to-pink flowers (to 1/4” long) in small terminal clusters bloom in April to May. Rounded, berry-like fruits (drupes) ripen in August-September.  Each drupe (1/2” long) contains 5 nutlets (seeds). Drupes are green in summer ripening to red in fall, sometimes remaining on the plants throughout winter. Drupes are bittersweet raw off the plant, but sweeter when first boiled. Fruits are technically edible for humans, but are generally considered to be mealy and lacking flavor. Meriwether Lewis described these fruits in 1806 to be “tasteless and insipid.” On the plus side, bears, birds and small mammals love the fruits.Genus name comes from the Greek words arctos meaning bear and staphyle meaning bunch of grapes in reference to the fruits (often in grape-like clusters) which are commonly eaten by bears.The specific epithet comes from the Latin words uva meaning grape and ursus meaning bear thus bear’s grape, also in reference to the fruits serving in the wild as bear food. Bearberry nickname means the same thing, namely, that bears eat the fruits of this plant.One of the popular common names for this plant is kinnikinnick which is an Algonquin word meaning smoking mixture. Native Americans and later early pioneers sometimes smoked the dried leaves of bearberry (alone or mixed with other leaves, tobacco and/or the dry inner bark of red osier dogwood) in pipes.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. If grown in poorly-drained sites or in climates hotter than preferred, this bearberry becomes more susceptible to certain diseases such as root rot, black mildew, leaf gall, leaf spot and rust.","Garden Uses
 Moderate to large scale ground cover with year round interest. Helps control soil erosion on slopes and hillsides. Effective when grown around shrubs, along sunny border margins, in naturalized areas and in native plant gardens. Herb gardens. Drape over a wall. Rock gardens.  
 

 Teas have been made from certain plant parts (leaves, stems and roots) for a variety of medicinal purposes (antiseptic, astringent and diuretic). Leaves are rich in tannins and have been used in the process of tanning hides/leather. Sprigs of green leaves with red berries may be used as Christmas decorations.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Artemisia dracunculus, commonly called wild tarragon, is a polymorphic species that is native to temperate Europe and Asia. It is also found in western North America, though many of these populations may have resulted from introduction and naturalization. It produces viable seed and will often self-seed. Its leaves produce variable flavor and aroma, sometimes lacking both flavor and aroma. It has a long history of medicinal uses, but the species is not often used for culinary purposes. It is a rhizomatous perennial or sub-shrub that typically grows to 24” (less frequently to 36”) tall on generally erect stems clad with narrow, linear to lance-shaped, light to medium green leaves (to 3-4” long). Greenish white flowers in narrow elongated panicles bloom in summer.  
 

 Tarragon sold under the species name without reference to cultivar or variety may be the less pungent Russian tarragon, which is considered by most cooks to be significantly inferior for culinary use.

 Artemisia vulgaris, commonly known by a large number of common names including mugwort, wild wormwood, and felon herb, is an upright rhizomatous herbaceous perennial which grows 2-4’ (less frequently to 6') tall but spreads in the landscape by rhizomes, often aggressively, to 6’ wide or more.  
 

 It is native to and widespread in Europe and throughout northern Asia from Russia to Japan and Korea. It can be weedy and invasive, particularly in disturbed sites. It was introduced as an herbal plant into a number of sites in North America, starting with the first European visits in the early 1600's. Plants have naturalized over time throughout southern Canada, the eastern and Midwestern United States (Maine to Minnesota south to Florida and Louisiana) and in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana). It typically grows in loamy or sandy soils in forested areas, coastal strands and along roadsides. 
 

 Plants feature (a) angular reddish-brown stems, (b) aromatic, petiolate, deeply lobed and cut basal and middle leaves which grow to as much as 4” long, each leaf being deep green above and white tomentose beneath, (c) smaller and narrower cauline upper leaves which become linear in the flower panicles, (d) yellowish to reddish brown apetalous discoid flowers (to 1/8” across) which bloom late summer to early fall in dense leafy panicles, and (e) achenes which follow the flowers.  
 

 This species has a long history of human use in Europe and Asia as an herbal medicine. Leaves are technically edible, but bitter and toxic when consumed in quantity. Aroma from fresh or dried plant leaves will repel insects.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet means common.Common name of felon herb comes from a prior herbal medicinal use of this plant in the treatment of felons, a painful pus-producing infection which typically occurs at the end of a finger or toe. Mugwort common name (mug means drinking vessel) comes from an historical use of this plant in Europe to flavor beer before the introduction of hops. Wormwood common name is in reference to the former European growth of this plant as a vermifuge (folk medicine remedy for expelling worms from the intestinal tract).","Problems

May also be grown as an indoor plant in bright sun with regular watering during the growing season and with reduced watering in a cool location in winter.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Asclepias curassavica, commonly called blood flower, is a tender evergreen perennial in the dogbane and milkweed family. It is native to South America, but has naturalized worldwide in many tropical and subtropical areas. It has a much longer flowering period than the perennial milkweeds that are winter hardy in St. Louis. It typically grows as a subshrub to 2-3’ tall on upright stems clad with pointed, opposite, lanceolate leaves (to 6” long). Leaves are medium green sometimes with white midribs. Showy flowers with five sepals and five lobes appear in rounded axillary clusters (cymes) in late spring to early summer. Flowers are red-orange with yellow hoods. Flowering continues throughout the summer to early autumn. Hummingbirds, butterflies and bees are attracted to the flowers. Monarch butterflies lay eggs on this plant and the resulting larvae (caterpillars) use the plant leaves as a food source. Flowers are followed by long, narrow seed pods (3-4” long) which split open when ripe releasing silky tailed seeds for dispersal by wind. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Plants can be poisonous to livestock. Additional common names for this plant include tropical milkweed, scarlet milkweed, swallow wort, Indian root and matal.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means of Curacao of the Dutch Antilles in the southern Caribbean Sea.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Somewhat weedy and can spread in warm winter locations where it will self-seed. Watch for aphids. Sooty mold may develop if aphid populations are not checked.

 Asclepias purpurascens, commonly called purple milkweed, is a rough, weedy, Missouri native perennial that commonly occurs in dry to moist open woods, dry ridge tops, thickets, glades, prairie openings, stream banks and wet meadows throughout most of the state (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to common milkweed (A. syriaca), except its flowers are deep rose pink and its leaves are more pointed. It typically grows 2-3’ tall on stout, upright stems with heavy, pointed, short-stalked, ovate to oblong-lanceolate, opposite leaves (to 8” long). Leaves are dark green above and slightly pubescent below. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Tiny, deep rose-pink flowers appear in many-flowered umbels in May-July. Each tiny flower (to 3/4” long) has 5 reflexed petals and 5 purple heads. Flowers give way to smooth seed pods (to 6” long) which split open when ripe releasing their numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars).Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means purple.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where plants may be grown outside in the ground in warm, bright but shady locations in humus-rich, moist but well-drained soils with added leaf mold, sand and grit. Avoid direct sun. Ferns grown outside prefer minimum temperatures of 50 degrees F., but will usually tolerate occasional brief temperature dips into the high 30s.  
 

 In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant. It performs best in a porous, well-drained, peaty potting mixture in bright filtered light. Avoid direct sun or dense shade locations. It does best in warm, moderately bright areas of the home, but tolerates some shade. Grows well in bright north-facing windows. Keep soils uniformly moist. Fairly high humidity is needed, which is a condition that can sometimes be difficult to achieve indoors in winter. Good plant sites include humidified areas, bathrooms or atop wet-pebbled trays. Avoid handling the somewhat delicate fronds. Indoor plants generally seem to have less tolerance for temperatures that dip below 50 degrees F. than plants grown in the ground outdoors. Ideal indoor temperatures are 60-70 degrees F. with a minimum of 55 degrees F.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Asplenium nidus, commonly called bird’s nest fern, is a slow-growing, epiphytic fern of the spleenwort family featuring simple, entire, strap-shaped, glossy, bright apple green fronds with contrasting dark brown to black midribs and undulating margins. Fronds spread upward and outward to form a vase-shaped, green rosette with a nest-like center (albeit memorialized by some as resembling a bird’s nest) into which fallen leaves and other organic matter typically accumulate. Mature fronds on outdoor plants grow to as much as 4-5’ long with a spread to 8” wide, but fronds on indoor container plants typically grow to only 1 1/2' to 2’ long. Undersides often display sori (clusters of sporangia) arranged in herringbone fashion in straight black lines from the central mid-rib to the frond margin. 
 

 Species plants are native to tropical areas from Polynesia and Hawaii west to Southeast Asia, Australia, and Madagascar. They are often found growing on tropical rainforest trees as epiphytes which collect water and organic matter in their bowl-shaped rosettes.Genus name comes from the Greek and means ""without a spleen"", possibly in reference to the believe that certain species of this plant could treat problems of the spleen.Specific epithet means nest in obvious reference to the nest-like structure formed by the rosette of overlapping fronds.Common name of bird’s nest fern is in reference to the aforementioned nest formed by the fronds which arguably resembles a bird’s nest.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for slugs and scale. Drafts may cause fronds to brown at the edges. Chemical insecticides will damage plants (use soaps if necessary). Mealybugs. Bacterial leaf diseases. Leaf nematode is also common.","Garden Uses

 Averrhoa carambola, commonly called star fruit is a small, slow-growing, short-trunked tropical tree that probably originated in Malaysia, Indonesia and southern China. It now extinct in the wild. It is grown commercially in many tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world for its unusual fruit. It also serves as an attractive, multi-branched ornamental tree. It typically grows to 20-30' tall with a broad rounded crown featuring odd-pinnate, medium green leaves (to 6-10"" long). Each leaf has 5-11 ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaflets (to 1.5-3.5"" long). Leaflets are sensitive to light and touch, folding up like mimosas in the dark of night or if disturbed. Fragrant rose flowers (1/4"" across) bloom in the leaf axils throughout the year, typically in up to four separate flushes. Flowers give way to waxy, oblong/ellipsoidal, 5-angled, orange/yellow-skinned fruits (3-6"" long) which are star-shaped when sliced in cross-section, hence the common name. Fruit flesh is juicy and ranges from sour to mildly sweet when ripe. Fruits are typically eaten fresh, combined in salads with other fruits, added to dessert dishes or sliced for use as star-shaped garnishes.Genus name comes from the fruit trees named after a celebrated Moorish physician and philosopher Ibn-Ruschd known as Averroes (1126-1198) who was born in Cordoba, Spain.","Problems

 Baccharis pilularis, commonly known as chaparral broom, coyote brush or dwarf chaparral false willow, is an evergreen shrub that typically grows in two different forms, namely, as (1) a prostrate, mat-forming, evergreen groundcover shrub to 8-24” tall spreading to 6’ wide or more, or (2) an upright-rounded shrub to 4-8’ tall and as wide. It is native to the western U. S. where it is primarily found on sea cliffs, bluffs, sand dunes, foothills and thickets in the outer coastal ranges from Mexico and Baja California north to Oregon. It prefers open, dry sites. It is distinguished by its dark brown stems clad with serrate, sticky-coated, obovate to oblanceolate green leaves (each 1/2 to 3/4” long). This shrub is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with the yellowish male flowers producing pollen and the pollinated white female flowers producing fruit (cottony seed clusters). Flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, but are not particularly ornamental. Sex of a plant cannot be determined until bloom time. Typically, only male plants are cultivated for home use because they lack the cottony seed clusters which some gardeners consider to be distracting and messy additions to the landscape.Genus name in honor of Bacchus, the god of wine.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pilulifera meaning having small little fruits in reference to the cottony orbicular seed clusters found on female plants.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9b-11. Best in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Best with moderate but consistent moisture. Grows well in a variety of soils as long as well-drained. Thrives in heat but leaves may brown along the edges in dry heat or droughty conditions. Established trees have respectable drought tolerance, however. Best sited in locations protected from cold winds and frost. Foliage will suffer damage when temperatures dip below freezing and tree will usually not survive winter temperatures that dip below 26 degrees F. This is a sterile hybrid (flat seed pods seen on other species are absent) that must be propagated by vegetative cuttings, air layering or grafting onto seedlings of one of the parent species. All trees in existence are descendants of the hybrids first cultivated at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens, all of which were propagated from the single accidental hybrid first discovered in 1880.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Bauhinia x blakeana, commonly known as Hong Kong Orchid Tree, is a small often multi-trunked evergreen to semi-evergreen flowering tree with an umbrella-like shape featuring an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows to 20’ tall, but occasionally in optimum conditions to as much as 40’ tall. This hybrid has no native territory as such because it is only known today from trees propagated from a single accidental hybrid discovered in the wild and collected in 1880 near the ruins of a house along the shore of Hong Kong Island near Pok Fu Lam. Cuttings were taken by a nearby French mission, with subsequent cuttings taken from the mission trees for inclusion at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens. This hybrid is not only considered to have the best ornamental flowers in the genus but is also considered to be one of the most attractive flowering trees in the world. Its parents are believed to be B. purpurea x B. variegata. This hybrid was first botanically described in 1908. It was chosen as the floral emblem of Hong Kong in 1965. Its flower image in white became the center of the red Hong Kong flag in 1997. In the U.S., this tree is frequently cultivated in Hawaii. It grows well in warm parts of California, Arizona, southern Florida and Texas.  
 

 Fragrant rich rose purple to rose crimson 5-6” wide orchid-like flowers with paler veins bloom over a long late fall to spring (November to April) period. Each flower has a 5-petaled corolla with the uppermost petal being darker toward the base. Flowers are shaped like some orchids (to 6” wide). Flowers of this hybrid are larger than the flowers on species plants. Bi-lobed, light to medium green leaves have yellowish green veins (6-8”). Leaves are deeply cleft at the apex and base, producing a twin leaf (butterfly wing) effect. Trees are partially deciduous (some leaf drop begins to occur in fall around the time flowering begins, but some leaves will persist to varying degrees throughout winter).Genus name honors 16th Century Swiss botanists and herbalists Johann Bauhin and Gaspard Bauhin (i.e., named after identical twins in reference to the bi-lobed leaves unique to genus plants).Hybrid name honors Sir Henry Blake, plant enthusiast and governor of Hong Kong from 1898 to 1903, and his wife Lady Edith Blake.","Problems

 Beaucarnea recurvata, commonly called ponytail palm, is an evergreen caudiciform shrub or tree that is native to semi-desert areas of southeastern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala where it typically grows to as much as 30' tall. Where not winter hardy, it is commonly grown as a houseplant that over time will eventually rise to as much as 6-8' tall. Notwithstanding its common name, ponytail palm is not a true palm. It is noted for having a large, swollen, often flask-shaped, water-retaining base (caudex) from which rises a trunk-like stem bearing narrow, flat, palm-like, spreading to recurved leaves (to 6' long but only 1"" wide) that droop fountain-like in clusters from the branch ends. Trunks are usually single with young plants, but several smaller trunks as well as some sparse branching near the top may develop with age. Old plants may produce tiny creamy white flowers in clusters. Flowers rarely appear on houseplants.Genus name is of uncertain origin.Specific epithet means curved backwards.","Problems

 Easily grown in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants prefer part shade in southern areas with hot summers. Plants are intolerant of drought. Although English daisy is a perennial, it is typically grown for ornamental purposes as a biennial in the South or as an annual in the North, with plants being dug up and thrown away after bloom. It is usually grown from seed. In the South (including St. Louis), seed is planted in fall or indoors in winter for bloom the following spring. By the heat of the summer, plants decline to the point where removal becomes appropriate. In the North, seed is planted in early spring for bloom in summer. In cool summer conditions (USDA Zones 4-5 and the West Coast), plants may spread aggressively by spreading crowns and self-seeding.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Bellis perennis, commonly called English daisy, has a varied reputation (depending in large part on geographical location) ranging from attractive low-spreading ornamental flower to common (sometimes detested) weed of lawns, fields and abandoned areas. Each plant features a sprawling, flattened rosette of small, spatula-shaped, dark green leaves to 1-2” tall. Daisies (to 2” diameter) with white rays and yellow centers bloom on pubescent stems rising to 3-6” tall. Young leaves may be eaten raw in salads or cooked. In the St. Louis area, plants are not considered to be lawn weeds, with best bloom occurring in spring when the mornings are cool. Plants typically burn out with summer heat. Native to Europe, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the northern U. S. and West Coast.Genus name comes from the Latin word bellus meaning pretty.Specific epithet means lasting through the year.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. In cool summer areas, plants can spread and difficult to eradicate once established.","Garden Uses

 Best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, light to sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. For many of the plants in this species, seeds (dried ""seed clusters"", each with 3 or 4 seeds) are typically sown in the ground about 30 days prior to the last spring frost date in Zones 3-7 for harvest in summer and fall or in the alternative, are sown in summer in Zones 8-10 for harvest over winter. Several seedlings will emerge from each seed cluster. Seedlings should be thinned to a spread appropriate for the specific type of plant being grown. Successive plantings may be made at monthly intervals during the growing season (seed planted in the heat of summer may not germinate however). For proper growth, species plants generally need regular and consistent moisture, with additional water provided during hot and dry summer periods.

 Beta vulgaris, commonly known as beet, is an herbaceous biennial (infrequently perennial) which is typically grown today as an annual. The ancestor plant for this species is the wild sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritime) which was probably native to coastal parts of the Mediterranean, but which eventually spread over time to the Atlantic Coast of Europe, the Near East and India. Sea beet can still be found as a wild plant along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. In general, beets of this species have been valued since ancient times for their edible leaves and midribs. Ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated beets as potherbs. Cultivation of beet roots as food first gained momentum in the 16th century.  From the 16th century onward, Europeans began to consume the roots primarily as a vegetable. During the 1800’s, intense artificial selection in Europe produced diverse beet cultivars used today for a variety of different purposes.  
  
 Beet cultivars today are classified into four different Groups (a Group being an assemblage of named cultivars with similar characteristics). Groups grown for their thickened tuberous roots (beets) are: 
 

 1. Beta vulgaris (Garden Beet or Beetroot Group) is the red root vegetable sold in grocery stores around the world as garden beets. This Group is best associated with the word “beet”. 
 

 2. Beta vulgaris (Sugar Beet Group) is the plant which is commercially grown for sugar production (roots contain high concentrations of sucrose). Roots were first found to contain sugar in 1747. This beet was developed in Germany in the late 18th century. About 20-25% of the sugar produced in the world today comes from sugar beets.
 

 3. Beta vulgaris (Fodderbeet Group or Mangelwurzel) is grown for its tubers which are harvested for use as livestock fodder. It was developed in the 18th century. 
 

 Group grown for their leaves rather than tuberous roots:  
 

 4. Beta vulgaris (Leaf Beet Group) is a leaf vegetable (e.g. chard or spinach beet) which is grown for harvest of its edible leaves and midribs. Leaf beets have been cultivated from ancient times to present. Group plants lack swollen tubers/roots. Spinach beet is similar in taste to spinach (Spinacia).  
  
 In general, genus plants typically grow to 2-3’ tall (to 4-6’ tall when in flower in the second year). Ovate to wedge-shaped, long-petioled, basal leaves (to 6” long) appear in rosettes with smaller, alternate, second-year stem leaves. Deep purple-red (but sometimes golden yellow or red/white striped) roots are usually swollen, except in the case of the leafy vegetable plants found in the Leaf Beet Group. Flowers (usually greenish and non-showy, but sometimes with red or purple tinges) bloom in dense spikes only in the second year, which means the flowers are typically not seen when plants are grown and harvested for their beets and/or leaves as one-year annuals.Genus name comes from the Latin name for beet.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning common.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Beets may suffer from fungal leaf spots, downy mildew, powdery mildew and root rots. Watch for leaf miners, flea beetles, leafhoppers, aphids and caterpillars.","Garden Uses

 Easily grown average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. River birch is perhaps the most culturally adaptable and heat tolerant of the birches. Prefers moist, acidic, fertile soils including semi-aquatic conditions, but also tolerates drier soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. Adapts well to heavy clay soils of Missouri and will tolerate poor drainage. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Betula nigra, commonly called river birch, is a vigorous, fast-growing, medium-sized, Missouri native deciduous tree which occurs on floodplains, swampy bottomlands and along streams throughout the State. In cultivation, it can be trained as either a single trunk or multi-trunked tree. As a single trunk tree, it develops a pyramidal habit when young, but matures to a more rounded shape typically growing 40-70' tall. Multi-trunked trees form a more irregular crown and are generally considered to be the superior growth habit for this species. Salmon-pink to reddish brown bark exfoliates to reveal lighter inner bark. Leathery, diamond-shaped, medium to dark green leaves (1.5-3.5"" long) with doubly toothed margins turn yellow in fall. Monoecious flowers appear in drooping, brownish male catkins and smaller, upright, greenish female catkins.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means black.","Problems
 One of the most disease-free birches. Most species of birch grow best in cool, northern climates, but do not adapt well to the hot summers of USDA Zones 5-9 and can be short-lived therein. Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which typically infects and kills birches stressed by summer heat and humidity. River birches are Missouri natives that are naturally adapted to the climate and are extremely resistant to birch borer. Although river birches have some susceptibility to aphids, leaf miner and iron chlorosis in high pH soils, these problems are somewhat minor in comparison to the birch borer.'Heritage' is a very popular river birch cultivar with superior ornamental features to the species (see Betula nigra 'Curly' HERITAGE).","Garden Uses

 In St. Louis, paper birch is best grown in medium to wet, well-drained sandy or rocky loams in part shade. It is best sited in a northern or eastern exposure that receives some afternoon shade. It needs consistently moist soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. It needs little pruning, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running. Performs best in cool northern climates where summer temperatures rarely exceed 75 degrees F. and where root zones are generally covered with snow throughout the winter.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Betula papyrifera, commonly called paper birch or canoe birch, is primarily native to the cold climates of Canada and Alaska (USDA Zones 1-3), with its range dipping down into a few of the northern U.S. states (USDA Zones 4-5A) and further south in the mountains (to Colorado in the Rockies and to North Carolina in the Appalachians). This tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips to reveal an orange-brown inner bark. Mature trees develop black markings on the white bark. Single trunk trees grow to 50-70’ tall with an oval rounded crown. Multi-trunked trees grow shorter with a more irregular crown. Ovate, irregularly toothed, dark green leaves (to 4” long). Quality clear yellow fall color. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in drooping catkins (to 4” long) and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1 1/4” long). Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer. The use of the bark for making birch bark canoes is well known.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means paper-bearing.","Problems
 This species of birch grows poorly and is generally short-lived in the St. Louis climate. It thrives in cool northern summers, but does poorly in the heat and humidity of St. Louis summers.

 Betula pendula, commonly called European white birch or white birch, is native to Europe and Asia Minor where it typically occurs in wood margins, heaths, hills and slopes. It has been widely planted in Canada and the northern U.S. as an ornamental. As is the case with paper birch (B. papyrifera), this tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips. It is also noted for its drooping or pendulous branches, hence the specific epithet. Mature trees become furrowed and blackish-gray near the bottom of the trunk. It is a small to medium sized tree that typically grows to 30-40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with a pyramidal to oval rounded crown. Ovate, glabrous, toothed, glossy green leaves (to 2.5” long) have long tapered tips. Greenish-yellow fall color is usually undistinguished.

 Blechnum spicant, called deer fern or hard fern, is a northern species with a somewhat circumpolar distribution but most ferns in the genus Blechnum are found in tropical areas. It is native to northwestern North American from Alaska to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, a small corner of northern Idaho and California. It primarily occurs in moist to wet coniferous forests, wet slide areas, stream banks or bogs in up to sub-alpine terrain. It is also native to Europe and northeast Asia. This fern is particularly distinctive because of its two different types of fronds. Evergreen sterile fronds (to 8-24” long) are stiff, leathery, pinnatifid and dark green, forming a loose outward-spreading, flattened rosette. As the season progresses, sterile fronds may lie horizontally on the ground. Fertile fronds (16-24” long) are located in an erect vertical fountain in the center of the sterile frond rosette. They are similar to the sterile ones but taller, with much thinner and widely separated leaflets. Fertile fronds turn brown and wither by the end of the summer, leaving the evergreen sterile rosette.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name blechnon for a fern (probably not this one though).","Problems

 Grows best in full sun or light shade in well-drained, acid soils. Bougainvillea can tolerate hot, dry locations fairly well and flowers bountifully in full sun with regular watering. Chlorosis can be a problem in alkaline soil. Regular pruning may be necessary to shape the plant or direct its growth, it tolerates trimming well. Be careful when pruning to avoid injury from the 1 to 2 inch long thorns. In St. Louis, to bring bougainvillea into flower, a dormant period at a low temperature is essential in winter. The plant will drop most of its leaves and you should stop fertilizing. From March on, it must be given a well-lit, warm position. Late in May, it is best placed outdoors. If pruning is required this should be done immediately after flowering. Pinching the tips of new growth will encourage branching. Water freely in summer and sparingly in the winter. Fertilize every two weeks during the growing season.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 The 14 species of this South American genus in the four-o-clock family, seen in warm-temperate to tropical regions as spectacular climbers, are really scrambling shrubs and usually remain fairly compact or behave as ground covers if left free standing.

 Helichrysum heldreichii, commonly known as strawflower or everlasting, is a tender perennial or subshrub that typically grows in a mound to 2-3’ tall and as wide on woody-based stems clad with alternate, simple, linear leaves (to 3” long) covered with silvery-white downy hairs. It is native to chalky-limestone cliffs in Crete where it is currently classified as “Vulnerable” as per the 1995 Red Data Book of Rare and Threatened Plants of Greece. Inflorescence is a compound terminal corymb (flowers in clusters) of numerous, small, yellow-orange disk florets (rays absent) subtended by pale yellow involucre bracts. Flowers bloom in May. Flowers are popular additions to dried arrangements because the yellow florets and bracts retain their yellow color after being cut and dried, hence the common name of everlasting. Fruits are seed-like achenes.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning the sun and chrysos meaning golden.Specific epithet honors Theodor H.H. von Heldreich (1822-1902), German botanist who settled in Greece where he reportedly discovered 7 new genera and over 700 new species of plants.","Problems

 Easily grown as an annual in fertile, organically rich, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade. For culinary purposes, certain plants in this genus may be grown in home gardens by seed as annuals for harvest of mustard greens. Sow seeds directly in the ground in early spring 3/4” to 1” apart with 2’ between rows. Thin to 4-6” apart. Floating row covers are useful. Best to water plants early in the day so that they will dry off before nightfall, thus reducing the likelihood of attracting fungal diseases.  Crop should be ready to harvest 40-50 days after planting. Smaller and younger leaves are usually milder than larger and more mature leaves. Leaves are stronger-flavored as plants begin to bolt.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Brassica juncea, commonly known as Chinese mustard, brown mustard, Indian mustard, or leaf mustard, is an annual herb that is native to southern and eastern Asia. It has been cultivated for food in Europe and Asia for hundreds of years. It has given rise to a diverse range of leaf vegetables, little known in Europe, but popular in eastern Asia, including various Chinese mustard greens and Japanese mizuna.  
 

 This plant has been much cultivated in some areas for harvest of spring mustard greens which may be added raw to salads. Older leaves are often boiled before eating. Garden plants typically grow to 1-2’ tall, featuring short, petiolate, elliptic to obovate basal leaves (to 1’ long) with 2-3 lobes per side and upper stem leaves which are much smaller and entire. Leaf edges are toothed, scalloped or frilled. Masses of bright, yellow, 4-petaled flowers mature to 1.5” long, but are not ornamentally attractive.  
 

 Although extensively grown as a vegetable for its leaves, this plant is also often grown in some areas for its pungent seeds which are used to flavor many dishes and for its seed oil which is used in Asia for cooking. Pods containing smooth brown seeds mature in summer. Seed is the source of brown mustard. 
 

 This plant has also developed a reputation outside the culinary area as a somewhat invasive weed (it is currently included on invasive species lists in Michigan, Florida and Alaska).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means rush-like.","Problems

 Easily grown in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained loams in full sun. Kale is a cool weather vegetable that is best grown in the cool temperatures of fall. Leaves typically acquire their best flavor after the first fall frost. It may also be grown in early spring. If grown in summer, however, plants will need some afternoon shade, perhaps to simply survive. Plants perform poorly when daytime temperatures begin to consistently exceed 80 degrees F. For spring plantings, sow seed indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date. In the alternative, transplants may be purchased from local nurseries. In either case, the seedlings/transplants should be planted in the garden about 1-2 weeks prior to last spring frost date. For fall plantings, sow seed indoors in early July and plant the seedlings in the garden in mid-August. Plants tolerate light frosts. Depending on temperatures, plants may survive to Thanksgiving or into December in some years. In mild winter climates, plants often survive winter and continue to produce leaves until they bolt in spring. Apply mulch around plants to protect the shallow roots, reduce weeds and retain soil moisture. Rotate crops to avoid soil borne diseases. Plants may also be grown in containers.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Brassica oleracea (Acephala Group), commonly called kale, is a cool weather vegetable that is grown for harvest of its edible leaves. Although very similar to cabbage, kale is distinguished by having loose, upright, wavy-edged leaves that do not form a head (acephala from Greek means headless). Cabbage forms heads. Leaves are typically light green to blue green, but ornamental kales (grown primarily for ornamental foliage) come in leaf colors ranging from purple to red to pink to white. Acephala Group also includes genetically similar spring greens and collard greens. Kale is a biennial that is grown in St. Louis as an annual. Plants will grow to 18"" tall. Leaves may be harvested when they reach the approximate size of a human hand. Kale belongs to the Brassica family which includes other cool season vegetables such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower and kohlrabi.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means of the vegetable garden.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where it is easily grown in evenly moist but well-drained loams (e.g., sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade. Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun. When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to bronze in winter. Limited cold tolerance. Established plants have some drought tolerance. Should be grown in a protected location sheltered from strong winds in the northern parts of Zone 7 where it is marginally winter hardy. Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing. True species may be winter hardy to Zone 8, but B. harlandii of gardens (form of B. microphylla - see below) may have slightly better winter hardiness.  
 

 Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline. Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing. Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date. Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots. Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2” thick). Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation. Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Buxus harlandii, commonly known as Harland boxwood, is a small, bushy, multi-stemmed broadleaf evergreen shrub with a rounded vase-shaped form. It typically grows to 2-3’ (infrequently to 5’) tall and as wide. It is native to southern China where it is often found growing in open wooded areas and stream margins. Bright green leaves are oblanceolate to obovate-oblong (to 1.25” long). Each leaf has an indentation at the leaf tip. Fragrant pale yellow flowers bloom in April–May. Staminate flowers are stalked but pistilate ones are sessile. Attractive white trunk accents.
 

 Many plants sold in North America under this species name are in reality forms of Buxus microphylla.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood of some plants in he genus to make boxes. Another theory on common name is that the name is in reference to young plant stems which are quadrangular (square box cross section).","Problems
 Harland boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning. No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot. Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils. The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid. In the deep South, nematodes are of concern.

 Caesalpinia gilliesii, commonly called bird-of-paradise, is an evergreen (semi-deciduous to deciduous in the northern parts of its growing range) shrub or small tree in the pea family that typically grows to 10’ tall but occasionally rises to as much as 15’. It is native to subtropical areas of Argentina and Uruguay, but is now widely grown in tropical and warm temperate regions around the world for its attractive yellow flowers with bright red stamens which bloom in summer in upright open racemes on branches clad with fern-like bipinnate compound green leaves. It was introduced into the southwestern U.S. a number of years ago where it has now escaped gardens and naturalized from California and Nevada to Oklahoma and Texas plus Georgia.  It is unrelated to Strelitzia reginae of South Africa which is a smaller clump-forming perennial that is also commonly known as bird-of-paradise.  
 

 Each leaf (4-8” long) has 8-12 pairs of pinnae with each pinna having 7-11 pairs of elliptic leaflets (each to 1/2” long). Bruised foliage often has an unpleasant smell.

 Caesalpinia gilliesii, commonly called bird-of-paradise, is an evergreen (semi-deciduous to deciduous in the northern parts of its growing range) shrub or small tree in the pea family that typically grows to 10’ tall but occasionally rises to as much as 15’. It is native to subtropical areas of Argentina and Uruguay, but is now widely grown in tropical and warm temperate regions around the world for its attractive yellow flowers with bright red stamens which bloom in summer in upright open racemes on branches clad with fern-like bipinnate compound green leaves. It was introduced into the southwestern U.S. a number of years ago where it has now escaped gardens and naturalized from California and Nevada to Oklahoma and Texas plus Georgia.  It is unrelated to Strelitzia reginae of South Africa which is a smaller clump-forming perennial that is also commonly known as bird-of-paradise.  
 

 Each leaf (4-8” long) has 8-12 pairs of pinnae with each pinna having 7-11 pairs of elliptic leaflets (each to 1/2” long). Bruised foliage often has an unpleasant smell. Five-petaled, pale yellow flowers (to 4-5” long), each featuring 10 showy red stamens, bloom in open terminal racemes in summer (July-August). Flower is about 1” long, but the stamens protrude from the flower tube for another 3-4”.

 Caesalpinia pulcherrima, commonly called peacock flower or Barbados Pride, is a fast-growing upright shrub or small tree which typically matures to 10' tall (in shrub form) or to as much as 20' tall (in tree form). It is native to tropical America (probably the West Indies), but is now widely grown in tropical areas around the world for its long bloom of colorful flowers in upright racemes on prickly branches clad with twice pinnate green leaves. Bowl-shaped 5-petaled flowers (to 2"" wide) bloom spring to fall (year-round in tropical climates) in 4-8"" long terminal racemes (to 40 flowers per raceme) located at the branch ends. Flowers feature bright orange-yellow petals with contrasting elongated dark red stamens. Another common name for this shrub is dwarf poinciana in recognition of the similarity (although of smaller size) of the flowers of this shrub to the flowers of royal poinciana (Delonix regia). Feathery, twice pinnate green leaves are usually evergreen, but sometimes deciduous in areas near the edge of its growing range. Each leaf has 5-8 pairs of pinnae and 6-10 pairs of leaflets per pinna. Flowers are followed by oblong, flat fruits (seed pods to 2.5-4"" long), with each pod containing 8-10 dark brown to black seeds which are ejected as the pod splits open at maturity. This shrub has sharp prickles along its stems, leading to the sometimes used common name of Barbados flower fence because of its use in the West Indies as a flowering barrier fence. Green seed pods are cooked and eaten in Mexico.Genus name honors Andrea Cesalpini (1524/25-1603), Italian botanist, philosopher, and physician to Pope Clement VIII.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pulcher meaning beauty.","Problems

 Callistephus chinensis, commonly called China aster, is a popular annual that provides showy, 3-5-inch diameter blooms from early summer to fall on plants clad with ovate, toothed, medium green leaves. Species plants are infrequently grown because of the huge number of superior cultivars that have arisen over the years. Cultivar height ranges from 8-inch dwarfs to 36-inch tall plants. Cultivar appearance varies from single daisy-like flower heads with yellow centers to fully double flower heads with shaggy to pompom form. Cultivar colors include shades of white to pink, red, blue, violet, purple and yellow.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalli- meaning beautiful and stephos meaning a crown in reference to the flowers.Specific epithet means Chinese","Problems
 Aphids and spider mites may appear. Plants are susceptible to some significant disease problems including (1) aster yellows (spray if necessary to control leafhoppers), (2) aster wilt and (3) stem rot.

 Grow in moist, acidic, humusy, somewhat lean, sandy or gravelly, very well-drained soils of average fertility in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in full sun (better flowering), but may appreciate some part afternoon light shade in hot summer climates. Scotch heather prefers a moist and cool climate. It generally dislikes the high heat/humidity of the Midwest and deep South and is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 6. It also dislikes the heavy clay soils commonly found in the St. Louis area. Plants need regular and consistent moisture and should not be allowed to dry out. Do not site plants in locations exposed to strong winds. Mulch with peat moss. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow root systems. Prune in spring before new growth appears. Older shrubs often become leggy and unkempt, and appreciate an annual spring pruning.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Calluna vulgaris, commonly called Scotch heather, heather or ling, is a small, variably-sized, evergreen shrub that is native primarily to moors, dunes, bogs, heaths and hillsides from northern and western Europe to Siberia, Turkey and Morocco. It has naturalized in parts of North America, particularly in the northeastern U.S. and the Northwest. In optimum growing conditions, it will typically form thick mats of foliage. Tiny, four-ranked, scale-like leaves in overlapping pairs appear on slender stems rising on average to 24” tall. However cultivars appear in a wider range of sizes including prostrate forms with small tufts to only 4” tall. Leaves are typically gray to green in spring and summer but acquire bronze to purple tones in fall and winter. Rose pink to purplish pink flowers in terminal, one-sided, spike-like racemes appear in mid to late summer. The Royal Horticultural Society currently lists over 800 cultivars of this species.Genus name comes from the Greek word kalluno meaning to cleanse or adorn. Plants were used for making brooms.Specific epithet means common.","Problems
 Watch for spider mites and oystershell scale. Stem and root rot may occur, particularly during warm and humid summer weather.","Garden Uses
 Smaller varieties are useful as ground covers or in the rock garden. More erect shrubs are effective when planted in mass on hillsides. Also may be sited in borders and as background plants.

 Best grown in deep, moderately fertile, moist but well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Appreciates a location protected from drying winter winds. Tolerates shearing. Although native to western North America, this incense cedar does very well in the East and is surprisingly tolerant of summer heat and humidity.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Calocedrus decurrens, commonly called incense cedar, is an aromatic evergreen conifer with upright branching that is narrow-columnar in youth but may broaden with age to conical sometimes with a rounded crown. It is native to the Cascades, Sierras and coastal ranges, usually scattered in mixed conifer forest on western slopes, from Oregon to California, southwestern Nevada and northern Baja California. In the wild, it may grow to 100-150’ and live to 1000+ years. In cultivation, it typically grows shorter to 30-50’ tall. Flattened branchlets in fern-like sprays are covered with overlapping, lustrous, rich green, scale-like foliage in whorls of four. Foliage has an incense-like aroma when crushed. Reddish-brown, deeply-furrowed, scaly bark appears on mature trees. Solitary fruiting cones (to 1” long) ripen in summer at the branchlet ends. Although small, cones are very distinctive and are commonly described as resembling duckbills when they open to release their seed. Synonymous with and formerly known as Libocedrus decurrens.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalos meaning beautiful and cedrus meaning cedar tree.","Problems

 Caltha palustris, commonly called marsh marigold, is a rhizomatous perennial that in North America is native to marshes, swamps, wet meadows and stream margins from Newfoundland to Alaska south to Nebraska, Tennessee and North Carolina. Unfortunately, the name marsh marigold is only descriptively accurate as to this plant’s habitat, because it neither looks like nor is related to marigolds (Aster family). It belongs to the buttercup family, and its shiny yellow flowers indeed look very much like buttercups. It typically grows 12-18” tall on hollow, branching stems. Bright yellow flowers (1-2” diameter) with 5-9 waxy deep yellow petal-like sepals bloom in spring (April to June). Flowers give way to seed pods which split open when ripe to disperse the seeds within. Long-stalked, rounded to cordate, glossy green basal leaves (to 7” across) attain mature size in summer well after flowering. Upper stem leaves are smaller and stalkless. Flower buds may be cooked and pickled in vinegar for use as a substitute for capers. Young leaves are also edible as cooked greens when boiled. No part of this plant should ever be eaten raw however.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a plant with a yellow flower, probably Calendula.Specific epithet means marsh-loving.","Problems

 Camellia japonica and most of its cultivars are considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9. Even where winter hardy, unusually cold temperatures in winter (below 10 degrees F), particularly when occurring as a sudden temperature change, can damage or sometimes kill these plants. Japanese camellias may not be grown outdoors year round in the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6) except for a very limited number of recently developed cultivars which have displayed exceptional hardiness. 
 

 Where winter hardy, Camellia japonica should be grown in moist, acidic (5.5 to 6.5 pH), loose, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade. Consistent and even moisture is important. Avoid wet soils. Plants require protection from direct afternoon sun and wind. Best location may be sun-dappled part shade. Best with a root mulch. Near the northern parts of their growing range, plants should be sited in sheltered and protected microclimates such as near the south side of a home or building. Burlap wraps are sometimes helpful. Plants generally dislike changes in temperature, irregular watering or being moved. Even a change in humidity can cause plants to drop buds. Fertilize monthly in spring and summer. If desired, remove all but one bud from each cluster to increase the size of the flower. Prune immediately after flowering.  
 

 Container plants are an option for the St. Louis area and other places where plants are not winter hardy, but containers are typically not an effective option because camellias generally overwinter poorly in private residences where growing conditions and room temperatures cannot be controlled.  For container plants to thrive indoors, they must be overwintered in a temperature-controlled environment such as a greenhouse where maximum winter temperatures range from 45 to 55 degrees F. Flower buds typically fall off where winter temperatures exceed 55 degrees F.  
 

 A limited number of cultivars of this species are now temperature rated to USDA Zone 6, and may be grown outdoors all year in the St. Louis area in protected locations around homes, foundations and patios.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Camellia japonica, commonly called Japanese camellia, is an evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-12’ tall on stems clad with oval, leathery, glossy, dark green leaves (3-4” long) with finely serrated margins. It is native to China and Japan. It is winter hardy to and often grown outdoors year round in the southeastern U.S. plus Pacific coast areas. It is the most commonly grown camellia species comprising thousands of cultivated varieties. It is the state flower of Alabama. The majority of the camellias grown at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis are grown indoors at the Linnean House. Flower buds begin to form in mid-summer. Buds appear in clusters. Removing all but one bud per cluster will increase flower size. Flowers (3-5” wide) bloom in mid-late winter (December to March) when grown outdoors in warm winter climates or in greenhouses, but bloom in early spring (April) when grown outdoors in the northern part of its growing range. Species plants have single flowers, but cultivars with semidouble, anemone, peony, rose-form double, or formal double flower forms are available. Each single flower has 5-8 petals. Flower colors are most commonly white, pink or red with yellow anthers. Flowers are borne at the tips of shoots or from lower leaf axils. Rounded fruits (1 1/2” long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet is in reference to native territory of this species.","Problems
 Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, black mold, flower blight, canker and root rot. Scale can be a troublesome insect pest. Aphids, thrips, mealybugs and mites may appear. Yellow leaves may mean too little acidity in the soil. Some flower bud dropping may be natural, but sometimes may be caused by overwatering or underwatering. Limit pruning to removal of dead or damaged wood, unproductive branches, and disproportionately long shoots. Shearing spoils the naturally attractive shape of the camellia. Prune immediately after flowering or in early summer to stimulate branching. Pruning later in the year can remove flower buds.","Garden Uses
 Excellent flowering shrub for lawns, shrub borders, backgrounds, informal hedges and around homes in mild winter locations. When grown outside their specified hardiness range, camellias are used primarily as conservatory plants, and they perform quite well in this environment. Since they react badly to change (e.g., drop their buds), it is usually not recommended that they be moved outside in the summer months and then returned inside in the fall. If possible, camellias should be grown in a brightly lit space that can accommodate their large spreading habit and be kept cool in the fall and winter to induce flowering.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Plants are tolerant of full sun as long as soils are not allowed to dry out, but generally appreciate protection from hot sun and drying winds. Application of a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark) is advisable. Prune as needed to control size and shape after flowering.  
 

 This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a), but will usually survive winters therein in years where temperatures do not dip below zero degrees F. In the alternative, this plant may be grown in tubs or containers that are overwintered indoors in a greenhouse or in the bright cool conditions of a sunroom with slightly reduced watering.  
 

 Most sasanqua camellias are commercially sold in pots or tubs. When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to plant them with the soil level in the container even with the soil level of the ground.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Camellia sasanqua, commonly known as sasanqua camellia, is a densely branched, pyramidal to oval-rounded, tree-like, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-10’ tall. It is native to Japan. It is ornamentally noted for its attractive dark green foliage and fall to early winter flowers. Lustrous, narrow-oval to obovate, dark green leaves (to 3” long) are cuneate and hairy on the midrib with rounded marginal teeth and pubescent petioles. Stems (reddish when young) are covered with significant pubescence. White to pale pink, 6-8 petaled, mildly aromatic flowers (2-3” diameter), each having a central mass of bright yellow-anthered stamens, bloom late summer to early winter depending on local climate. Petals fall after several days but stamens remain, with additional flowers continuing to open in succession over a period of 4-6 weeks. Flowers are followed by small rounded fruits. Species flowers are single, but cultivar flowers often come in single, semi-double or double-flowered forms, with flower colors ranging primarily from white to red. Fruit is a smooth and shiny capsule (to 3/4"" long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet comes from the Japanese name sasankua for a popular native species of Camellia.","Problems
 Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, anthracnose, viruses, black mold, petal blight, canker and root rot. If petal blight occurs (browning that runs from edges to the center), all infected plant parts should be promptly removed.

Does not do well in climates where nighttime temperatures consistently remain above 70 degrees F. Spreads quickly from root crowns by prostrate stems, but is generally easily controlled since stems can be easily trimmed to control growth. May be grown from seed. Clumps may be divided in spring. Foliage is semi-evergreen to evergreen in warm winter climates.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Campanula poscharskyana, commonly called Serbian bellflower, is a prostrate, sprawling perennial which typically forms a low, mounding ground cover to 4-6"" tall (less frequently to 12""). Campanulate, lilac-blue flowers with flaring, star-shaped lobes (to 1"" wide) appear in loose panicles along the stems in late spring. Long-stalked, oval-rounded to cordate, medium green leaves (to 1.5""). Native to the northern Balkans, including, as the common name suggests, Serbia.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet honors Gustav Adolf Poscharsky (1832-1914), head gardener in Dresden, Germany.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants prefer cool summer climates. They are intolerant of the extreme heat of the deep South, and do not perform well south of USDA Zone 6. They appreciate part afternoon shade in hot summer climates including Missouri. Plants typically need regular and even moisture. Deadhead spent flowers to encourage additional bloom. Plants are often short-lived, but will easily remain in the garden in optimum growing conditions by self-seeding. Seed may be planted in the garden in late spring for bloom the following year. Plants will spread in the garden by creeping roots. Plants may be propagated by cuttings, but division of mature plants can be difficult.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Campanula rotundifolia, commonly called bluebell or harebell, is a rosette-forming, upright perennial that typically grows to 20"" tall. It is noted for producing attractive, bell-shaped, nodding blue flowers (each to 1/2"" long) that bloom singly or in small clusters from the stem tips throughout summer (June-September). This bluebell is native to a variety of different environments including meadows, grasslands, rocky slopes, crevices, alpine areas and sandy shores in the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. From a basal rosette of small, rounded, long-stalked, basal leaves (to 1"" wide) rise wiry, thread-like stems clad with narrow, alternate, linear leaves (each to 1-3"" long). Basal leaves usually wither early and disappear before the flowers form. This plant is also native to a small area in the Ozarks in Shannon County where it is found on north-facing limestone bluffs along the Jack's Fork River.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet is in reference to the rounded basal leaves.This bluebell has a large number of common names. Harebell may relate to the fact that this plant is sometimes found in areas inhabited by rabbits (hares). This same plant grows in Scotland where it is popularly known as the bluebells of Scotland or Scotch bluebell.","Problems

 Carex pensylvanica, commonly called Pennsylvania sedge, is a shade-loving perennial sedge that is native to thickets and dry woodland areas in Eastern and Central North America from Quebec to Manitoba south to Mississippi and Georgia. In Missouri, it is found mostly north of the Missouri River in dry to mesic upland forests and shaded bluff ledges (Steyermark). It typically grows in loose colonies with a creeping habit. Roots are reddish brown. It is often found in areas with oak trees, hence the additional common name of oak sedge. This is a low sedge with soft, delicate, arching, semi-evergreen leaves (each to 1/8"" wide). It typically grows in a clump to 8"" tall. It is semi-evergreen in moderately cold winter climates. Narrow, grass-like, medium green leaves (to 8-12"" long) are typically shorter than the flowering stems. Plants are monoecious (spikelets of male flowers above female flowers). Flowers bloom in late spring (May) in inflorescences atop rough, sharply triangular culms (stems) which rise up singly from the rhizomes. Staminate scales are green often tinged with reddish-purple with white margins. Pistillate scales are dark brown to purplish black with green midribs and white margins. Female flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).

 Carex radiata, commonly known as eastern star sedge (star-like flower clusters) or straight-styled wood sedge (tip of the female flower known as the style is straight rather than curled), is an evergreen perennial that typically produces a dense foliage clump to 8-12” tall of narrow, grass-like, medium green blades. This sedge is native to mesic to wet-mesic bottomlands and upland forests and on moist ravine slopes, sometimes in seasonally wet locations, in eastern North America from Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Georgia.  
 

 Ascending to wide-spreading, triangular culms (flower stems) rise above the foliage clump in spring to 20-28” tall. Most culms are topped by an open, elongate, yellowish-green, terminal inflorescence (to 1-3” long) consisting of 3-8 flower spikelets. Each spikelet contains a star-like cluster of 3-9 perigynia (perigynum is a scale-like bract which encloses each female flower). Flowers bloom from April-May. Male flowers, if present, are borne above the female flowers on the spikes (androgynous).  Female flowers are followed by tiny, ovate to obovate achenes which radiate outward from the stem in a star-like pattern. Short rhizomes are poorly-developed. 
  
 Carex radiata is very similar to and was formerly included in C. rosea.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet from Latin means radiating in reference to the developing seeds radiating outward from the stem.","Problems

 Carex stricta is a rhizomatous evergreen sedge that grows in dense tussocks (clumps) to 1-3' tall and to 2' wide. It is an emergent aquatic that is native primarily to wet swales, marshes, bogs, wet meadows and creek margins in eastern North America (Quebec to Ontario to North Dakota south to Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina). In Missouri, it is limited to several locations in calcareous, spring fed, swampy meadows in the Ozarks in the southeastern part of the State (Steyermark). Narrow, glaucous, grass-like leaves (to 3/8"" wide) grow in dense clumps. Older leaves turn straw brown as they die, and build up around the base of each clump surrounding the newer yellowish-green leaves. Flora of North America reports that plants grown in sites with seasonal flooding form distinctive large clumps, and plants grown in drier areas tend to spread more by rhizomes. Flowers appear in late spring in reddish-brown spikes atop stems rising above the foliage. Steyermark maintains that the scattered Missouri populations of this species are all that remains from an ancient Pleistocene presence that has gradually disappeared over time as the glaciers disappeared and the weather warmed.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means erect or upright.","Problems

 Carica papaya, commonly called papaya, is a small, frost-tender, succulent, broadleaf evergreen tree that bears papaya fruits throughout the year. Each tree (Hortus Third asserts papaya is technically a giant herb because it never produces true woody tissue) typically has a single, unbranched, non-woody trunk bearing the scars of old leaf bases. The trunk is topped by an umbrella-like canopy of palmately lobed leaves. Large, fleshy, melon-like fruits (papayas) hang in clusters attached to the trunk top just under the leaf canopy. Papaya typically grows to 6-20' tall (container plants to 10' tall) and is most noted for its edible melon-like fruit. It is native to lowland tropical areas of Central and South America, but is now grown in tropical to subtropical regions throughout the world both commercially and in home gardens. In the U.S., it is commercially grown in southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii. Seven lobed leaves (to 2' wide) on leaf stalks to 2-3' long are ornamentally attractive. Species plants are typically dioecious (separate male and female trees), but cultivars are hermaphroditic. Fragrant, trumpet-shaped, yellowish-white flowers bloom throughout the year, with males in long racemes and females in small clusters or solitary. Female flowers give way to smooth-skinned green fruits that ripen to yellow-orange with a yellow to pinkish-orange flesh and central cavity of pea-sized black seeds. Fruits and seeds are edible. Commercially sold fruits are typically 6-8"" long and weigh about one pound, but fruits in the wild in ideal growing conditions can grow much larger with a wieght of up to 20 pounds. Papain (an enzyme extracted from the milky sap of green fruit) is popularly used as a meat tenderizer, chewing gum additive and beer clarifier plus for a large number of additional medical, cosmetic and industrial purposes.Genus name comes from Greek meaning a kind of fig in reference to the fig-shaped leaves.","Problems

 Cassia fistula, commonly called golden shower tree, is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to 30-40' tall in an upright form often open at the top. It is native to India, Malaysia and Southeast Asia. It is well-known for producing a show-stopping bloom of yellow flowers in May-June/July. Even pinnate compound leaves to 12-16"" long with 4-8 pairs of ovate-lanceolate leaflets (each leaflet to 4"" long) per leaf. Leaves usually drop in April as a prelude to flowering which occurs from May to early July. Five-petaled, bright yellow flowers bloom in 8-18"" pendulous terminal racemes which cover the tree with profuse bloom. Flowers are lightly scented. Leaves return as the flowering progresses, with foliage totally restored by July. Tree is often considered to be semi-deciduous or semi-evergreen because of this brief loss of leaves. A second less significant bloom often occurs in September but without loss of leaves. Flowers are followed by slender, terete, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long. Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year. Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines. Golden shower tree is the National tree of Thailand and the national flower of Thailand. Popular plant as ornamental and for herbal medicine. Dried fruit has medicinal properties. Is now widely grown in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet means hollow like a pipe.","Problems

 Cassia leptophylla, commonly called gold medallion tree, is a small open-crowned tree with spreading, slightly drooping branches. It typically matures to 20-30' tall.  It is native to Brazil. It is noted for producing large pinnate leaves, a showy display of yellow flowers in summer and large bean-like seed pods following the flowers. This tree is now grown primarily as an ornamental in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. It is noted for performing better in the climate of the State of California than other species of Cassia. Each even-pinnate compound leaf (to 12-18"" long) has 9-14 pairs of small narrow leaflets (each to 2.5"" long). This tree is considered to be semi-evergreen (drops some leaves during the year, sometimes in tropical climates having dry seasons and sometimes in winter if extended cool weather or a tinge of frost occurs). This tree is particularly noted for producing a show-stopping bloom of fragrant yellow flowers (2-3"" wide) arranged in 6-10"" long terminal clusters (racemes), each containing 30-50 flowers. Flowers bloom in summer sometimes extending into early fall. Flowers are followed by slender, twisted, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long. Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year. Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet comes from Greek leptos meaning narrow and phyllon meaning leaf in reference to the narrow leaves of this tree.","Problems

 Grow in moist, well-drained loams in full sun. Species plants should not be planted as ornamentals due to susceptibility to blight. Research is ongoing for developing disease resistant varieties.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Castanea dentata, commonly called American chesnut, was once a major component of the Eastern hardwood forest. It is almost extinct in the wild now, having succumbed to chestnut blight, a bark fungal disease that probably entered the U.S. in a shipment of nursery stock from Japan in the late 1890s. American chestnut now persists mostly in the form of sprouts from old stumps and root systems. Typically the sprouts grow up and possibly flower and fruit for several years before dying back from the blight. Before blight introduction, mature trees typically reached 50-75’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with globular spreading crowns. Oblong-lanceolate, toothed, dull green leaves (6-10” long) turn shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic creamy yellow-white male flowers are densely clustered in slender catkins (4-8” long). Female flowers appear in smaller inconspicuous catkins. Blooms in June. Small nuts (hazel nut size) are sweet and edible, and are encased in spiny burrs (2-3” diameter). H. W. Longfellow’s poem “The Village Blacksmith” begins with the line “Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands….” in reference to this once stately and popular American tree.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet means toothed in reference to the toothed leaves.","Problems

It is noted for its resistance to chestnut blight which has nearly wiped out the native American chestnut (Castanea dentata). Chinese chestnut features oblong-lanceolate, coarsely toothed, dark green leaves (5-8” long) that are soft green and pubescent beneath. Leaves turn varying shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic monoecious creamy yellowish-white flowers appear in catkins in late spring (June in St. Louis), the male flowers located at the top portion of the catkin and the female flowers located near the base. Flowers can be quite showy, albeit for a brief period. Flowers are followed by edible chestnuts which are encased in spiny dehiscent burs (2-3” diameter), usually 2-3 nuts per bur.

 Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions including both wet and dry soils. Tolerant of seasonal flooding. Prefers moist fertile loams.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Catalpa speciosa, commonly called northern catalpa, is a medium to large, deciduous tree that typically grows to 40-70’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with an irregular, open-rounded to narrow-oval crown. It is native to a relatively small area extending from western Tennessee, northeastern Arkansas and the lowlands of southeastern Missouri north to southern Illinois and southern Indiana. In Missouri, it typically occurs along streams, bluff bases and in both low and upland woods (Steyermark). Broad ovate to ovate-oblong leaves (to 12” long) are pointed at the tips and rounded to cordate at the bases. Leaves are light green to yellow green above and densely pubescent below. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow in fall. Flowers can be a real showstopper, however. Bell-shaped, orchid-like white flowers (to 2” long) with purple and yellow inner spotting appear in panicles in late spring (late May to early June in St. Louis). Flowers give way to long slender green seedpods (12-22” long). The seedpods mature in fall to dark brown and then split open lengthwise to release the seeds within. Seedpods give rise to the common name of cigar tree, although they actually are longer and thinner than most cigars. Abundant pods are produced every 2 to 3 years. Bark of mature trees is fissured, prominently ridged and pale gray-brown. The leaves of this species do not emit an unpleasant aroma when bruised as is the case with the similar southern catalpa (Catalpa bignonioides).Genus name comes from a North American Indian name.Specific epithet means showy.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, leaf spots, mildew and twig blight. The larvae (caterpillars) of the catalpa sphinx moth may do considerable damage when feeding on the leaves.","Garden Uses
 A mature, symmetrically rounded catalpa tree can be a tree of great beauty, particularly in spring when the foliage is young and the flowers are in bloom. Unfortunately, it is otherwise a rather coarse tree that many believe does not deserve a prominent place in the landscape. Branches are brittle and mature trees infrequently exhibit classic form. Foliage also tends to depreciate as the growing season progresses, the large leaves being subject to damage from hail, wind, insects and sometime disease. It has been widely planted in urban areas as a street tree and lawn tree, and can also be effectively used in the landscape for difficult areas such as moist low spots or dry areas with poor soils.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

 Catananche caerulea, commonly called Cupid’s dart, is a short-lived, clump-forming perennial of the aster family. Blue to lavender-blue flowers (to 2” diameter) with dark centers bloom singly on naked wiry stems rising to 2’ tall from a mostly basal clump of narrow, lanceolate, grass-like, gray-green leaves (each 8-12” long). Each flower is subtended by overlapping papery bracts. Flowers bloom freely from mid-summer to autumn. Early Greeks and Romans used this Mediterranean native to make love potions, hence the genus name and common name of Cupid’s dart.Genus name comes from the Greek name meaning a strong incentive.Specific epithet means dark blue in reference to flower color.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it grows as a woody based perennial. In the St. Louis area, it is best grown as an annual bedding plant in well-drained sandy loams in full sun to part shade. Needs regular moisture, but avoid overhead watering. Superior soil drainage is the key to growing this annual well. Start seeds indoors 12-16 weeks before last frost date. Set out seedlings or purchased starter plants in spring after last frost date. Thrives in hot and humid summer weather. Cuttings may be taken from plants in late summer for overwintering so as to provide a stock the following spring. Container plants may be overwintered indoors. May self-seed in optimum growing conditions.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Catharanthus roseus, commonly called periwinkle, Madagascar periwinkle or annual vinca, is an erect to spreading tender perennial in the dogbane family typically mounding 6-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall and as wide. It produces attractive bushy foliage that is covered by an often profuse bloom of phlox-like flowers from summer to frost. Best flowering is in summer. Tubular flowers have five flattened petal-like lobes and appear singly in the upper leaf axils. Species flowers are rosy-pink to red with mauve throats. However, species plants are seldom seen in commerce today, having been largely replaced by larger flowered cultivars, many of which are dwarf to compact plants that sometimes have overlapping petals. Cultivars expand the available color range to include pale pink, rose, hot pink, red, lilac, and white, often with contrasting darker throats/eyes. Oblong to ovate glossy green leaves (to 2” long). Synonymous with and formerly know as Vinca rosea.Specific epithet means rose colored.","Problems

If attempted, however, site young trees in locations protected from winter winds.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cedrus deodara, know as Deodar cedar, is an evergreen conifers that is pyramidal when young, maturing to flat-topped trees with broad-spreading horizontal branching. Deodar cedar is perhaps the most pendulous of the true cedars, with drooping branchlets and branching that is gracefully drooping at the tips. Lower branches typically remain on the tree as it ages, often touching the ground. This is a medium-growing tree that typically matures to 40-50’ tall in its first 25 years. In its native habitat, trees reportedly will grow much taller over time, sometimes reaching 150-200’ tall. Dark grayish-green needles (to 1.25” long) appear in clusters. Upright cones (to 4” long). It is native to the Himalayas.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet comes from the North Indian name of this plant.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Tip blight and root rot may occur. Winter hardiness is a concern in the St. Louis area where consideration should be given to planting a cultivar such as ‘Shalimar’ that has slightly better hardiness than the species.

 Easily grown in most soils. Best in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun. Lean soils help restrain growth. Will grow in part shade, but needs full sun for best flowering and subsequent fruit display. Prune in late winter to early spring. Mature vines require little pruning other than removal of dead or excess growth. These plants are primarily dioecious (separate male and female plants), although some have a few perfect flowers. Female plants need a male pollinator to produce the attractive fruit that is the signature of this vine. Unfortunately, some nurseries do not sell the vines as male or female (as is commonly done with hollies). Generally one male plant is needed for 6-9 female plants. Female plants may be vegetatively propagated to create more female plants. Vines may be grown on structures or allowed to ramble along the ground. It is generally best to avoid growing vines up small trees or through shrubs because vines grow rapidly and can girdle trunks and branches causing damage and sometimes death. Vines sucker at the roots to form large colonies in the wild. Vines will also self-seed, often with assistance from local bird populations.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Celastrus scandens, commonly called American bittersweet, is a deciduous twining woody vine that is best known for its showy red berries that brighten up fall and winter landscapes. This species is native to central and eastern North America including Missouri. In Missouri, bittersweet is typically found in woodland areas, thickets, rocky slopes, bluffs, glade peripheries and along fence rows throughout the State (Steyermark). It is often seen growing along the ground, over and through low shrubs or circling trees in the wild. Berry-laden branches are prized for use as indoor decorations, and collection of the branches in the wild has significantly reduced the wild populations in some areas. Rapidly grows to 20’. It produces serrate, elliptic to ovate, yellowish-green leaves (to 4” long). Staminate and pistillate flowers appear in clusters on separate plants in late spring. Flowers are greenish-white to yellow. Fertilized female flowers give way in summer to spherical orange-yellow fruits. Fruits split open in fall to reveal scarlet fleshy berry-like seeds (arils). Fruits are poisonous if ingested, but are considered to be quite tasty by many birds. In the 1700s, plants were given the name bittersweet by European colonists because their fruits purportedly resembled in appearance the fruits of a Eurasian nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) that was known to them as bittersweet. The common name of false bittersweet also came to be used for the within species to distinguish it from the Eurasian nightshade. American bittersweet is the generally accepted common name that is used today, in large part to distinguish this American native from its aggressive Asiatic relative, C. orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) which has escaped cultivation and is naturalizing in parts of eastern and central North America.Genus name comes from the Greek word kelastros for an evergreen tree.Specific epithet means climbing.","Problems

 Celtis laevigata, commonly called sugarberry, sugar hackberry or southern hackberry, is basically a southern version of common or northern hackberry (see C. occidentalis). Sugarberry differs from common hackberry inter alia by (1) fruits are juicier and sweeter, (2) bark is less corky, (3) leaves are narrower with mostly smooth margins, (4) better resistance to witches’ broom and (5) less winter hardiness. Sugarberry is a medium to large sized deciduous tree that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with upright-arching branching and a rounded spreading crown. Trunk diameter ranges from 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’). This tree is native to and widely distributed throughout the southeast and south central U.S. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams and floodplains mostly south of the Missouri River except for the Ozark region. (Steyermark). Mature gray bark develops a warty texture. Insignificant, mostly monoecious, greenish flowers appear in spring (April –May), with male flowers in clusters and female flowers solitary. Female flowers give way to an often abundant fruit crop of round fleshy berry-like drupes maturing to deep purple. Each drupe has one round brown seed within. Fruits are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Birds consume the fruits and disperse the seeds. Fleshy parts of the fruit are edible and sweet. Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, rough-textured, untoothed, glossy to dull green leaves (2-4” long) have mostly uneven leaf bases. Undistinguished yellow fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another tree.Specific epithet means smooth.","Problems
 Hackberry nipple gall is so common in the St. Louis area that it is often used as an aid in identifying hackberries. Although the galls do not hurt these trees, they often significantly disfigure the leaves.

 Best grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates a somewhat wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones which inevitably lead to root rot. Grows well in cool summer climates. Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 2. Intolerant of the high summer heat and humidity of the deep South. Spreads by runners to fill in areas, but is not considered to be invasive in the hot St. Louis climate where it is less robust than in cooler northern climates. Plants will self-seed in the garden if spent blooms are not removed. Best to shear off flower stems after bloom in order to prevent self-seeding, reduce future foliage decline, and shape/neaten the foliage mat. Large beds can be mowed on a high setting.

 Cerastium tomentosum, known as snow-in-summer, is a short-lived, low-growing, mat-forming perennial which is typically massed in sunny locations as a ground cover. Tufts of narrow, gray-green leaves (each to 1"" long and 1/4"" wide) form a 6” tall foliage mat. Leaves are evergreen. In late spring, flower stems rise above the foliage mat (typically to 8-12”) carrying clusters (cymes) of white blooms which form a snow-like carpet (hence the common name). Flowers (to 1” diameter) have 5 notched petals and are similar in appearance and closely related to several of the chickweeds. Less invasive, more compact cultivars of this species usually make better garden plants.Genus name comes from the Greek word keras meaning horn in reference to the seed capsule which in some species is bent slightly like a cow’s horn.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's woolly white leaves and stems.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Damping off may occur in climates with high humidity or locations with too much shade. Root rot can be a serious problem if plants are grown in poorly-drained soils or in soils that remain wet. Plants are short-lived, and dead patches often begin to appear after several years. In St. Louis, foliage usually declines as the summer progresses.","Garden Uses

 Best grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates a somewhat wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones which inevitably lead to root rot. Grows well in cool summer climates. Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 2. Intolerant of the high summer heat and humidity of the deep South. Spreads by runners to fill in areas, but is not considered to be invasive in the hot St. Louis climate where it is less robust than in cooler northern climates. Plants will self-seed in the garden if spent blooms are not removed. Best to shear off flower stems after bloom in order to prevent self-seeding, reduce future foliage decline, and shape/neaten the foliage mat. Large beds can be mowed on a high setting. Divide every year if needed to help maintain compact size of the mat. Starter plants may be planted 9-12” apart to quickly cover large areas.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cerastium tomentosum, known as snow-in-summer, is a short-lived, low-growing, mat-forming perennial which is typically massed in sunny locations as a ground cover. Tufts of narrow, gray-green leaves (each to 1"" long and 1/4"" wide) form a 6” tall foliage mat. Leaves are evergreen. In late spring, flower stems rise above the foliage mat (typically to 8-12”) carrying clusters (cymes) of white blooms which form a snow-like carpet (hence the common name). Flowers (to 1” diameter) have 5 notched petals and are similar in appearance and closely related to several of the chickweeds. Less invasive, more compact cultivars of this species usually make better garden plants.Genus name comes from the Greek word keras meaning horn in reference to the seed capsule which in some species is bent slightly like a cow’s horn.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's woolly white leaves and stems.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Damping off may occur in climates with high humidity or locations with too much shade. Root rot can be a serious problem if plants are grown in poorly-drained soils or in soils that remain wet. Plants are short-lived, and dead patches often begin to appear after several years. In St. Louis, foliage usually declines as the summer progresses.","Garden Uses

 Chamaerops humilis, commonly known as Mediterranean fan palm or European fan palm, is a single- to multiple-trunked evergreen palm with an upright irregular form that typically matures as a shrub or small tree growing to 6-15’ tall with a spread to 6-20’ wide. It often suckers from the base of the main trunk to form a clump of 8-10 trunks, but it can be easily trained to grow with a single trunk by regularly removing the suckers. It is the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world, and the only palm that is native to Europe. Notwithstanding its outdoor growth potential, it typically matures to only 5’ tall when grown indoors in containers. It is native to rocky hills and mountains of the western Mediterranean Basin from Africa’s Atlas Mountains in Morocco, Algeria and Tunesia to Spain, Portugal, France and Italy.  
 

 Huge, distinctive, triangular, fine-textured, palmate-compound leaves are ornamentally attractive. Each leaf (to 24” long and as wide) has 10-20 narrow, finger-like, deeply divided leaflets which are arranged in the shape of a fan at the end of a spiny petiole (leaf stalk to 3-4’ long), hence the common name of fan palm. Leaves are variable in both color (light blue green to silver green) and shape (shrub to small tree). Bright yellow flowers bloom in spring, but are typically hidden from view behind the leaf stems. Flowers are followed by dark yellow, orange or brown fruits that ripen in fall. Flowers and fruits are somewhat inconspicuous and not showy.

 Citrus histrix, commonly called Thai lime or makrut lime, is a thorny, multi-stemmed, evergreen shrub or small tree of the citrus family that grows to 6-25’ tall. It is primarily native to Southeast Asia, but has widely naturalized in tropical areas with the specific location of its original distribution uncertain. Glossy, aromatic, double (two-parted), evergreen leaves from this tree are commonly shredded for use as a flavoring in a variety of Southeast Asian food dishes including soups, curries, rice, stir-fry, fish cakes, salads and marinades. Leaves may be harvested from home grown plants or purchased fresh or dried at Asian or specialty groceries. Four to five petalled white flowers are fragrant. Flowers are followed by rough bumpy green fruits (limes to 2” wide) which have a highly acidic flavor but little juice, so the juice and pulp is infrequently used in cooking. Fruit rinds are sour tasting, but often used for flavoring in a diced-up or grated form.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word hustrix meaning hedgehog in reference to the thorns present on this plant.Many authorities prefer the common name of Thai lime or makrut lime to Kaffir lime because of the insulting and derogatory meaning of the word kaffir in some parts of the world (e.g., an insult used by some South African whites for blacks).","Problems

 Citrus maxima, commonly called pummelo, is a parent of the grapefruit (C. sinensis x C. maxima). It is probably native to Thailand, but some experts say Polynesia and the Malay Peninsula. Today it is a very popular fruit in Southeast Asia and China. Some limited commercial growth takes place in the U.S. today (Florida, California and Hawaii). The fruit of this tree is huge, typically growing to 6-9"" (less frequently to 12"") in diameter. Weight is typically 2-4 pounds, but infrequently can mushroom to as much as 15 pounds. Fruits are pear-shaped with a thick rind. Taste of the fruit is reminiscent of grapefruit, but sweet instead of sour with less juice. Edible flesh is white, yellow or pink. Pummelo typically grows to 15-20' tall with a rounded crown. In optimum growing conditions it may rise to as much as 50' tall. Ovate to elliptic leaves (4-8"" long) are evergreen. Solitary or clustered white flowers (each to 1 1/3"" long) may bloom up to four times per year in ideal conditions, resulting in fruit being present on the tree almost year round.

 Use a trellis to train this vine in the house. To grow glory-bower or bleeding heart vine indoors, a winter rest is required. This can be accomplished by moving the vine to a cooler location away from any heat source. A spot between 60 to 65F during the day and 5 to 10 degrees lower at night would be ideal. Some leaf drop is a normal response to entering winter dormancy. During this period, water just enough to keep the soil from drying out and withhold fertilizer. In late winter or early spring, prune the vine before new growth emerges. Because flower buds are produced on current season’s growth, pruning at this time will encourage the production of vigorous flowering shoots. Do not be afraid to prune severely. Thin out old, overcrowded shoots and any other far-reaching growth to keep the vine in bounds. After pruning, move the plant to a warm, brightly lit location or outdoors if temperatures have warmed sufficiently. Water when the soil surface feels dry.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. This tropical species thrives in humid, frost free coastal lowlands and seashores. Best growth occurs in moderately fertile, humusy, moist, well-drained soils in full sun.  Needs minimum temperature of 64 degrees F. to produce fruit. May be grown in containers (sow seed in spring) in a soil-based potting mixture with grit or sand added.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cocos nucifera, commonly called coconut or coconut palm, is a tall tree that is native to tropical islands in the western Pacific. It has been commonly planted in frost free tropical areas throughout the world in a variety of conspicuous locations including coastal areas, beaches, parks, along streets, residential yards, near commercial buildings/hotels, and on golf courses. In the U. S., it will grow in southern Florida, the southern tip of Texas and Hawaii. It does not perform well in southern California. Trees will typically mature to 50-100' tall over time. This is a single-trunked palm with a branchless, often-curved, light gray trunk which is swollen at the base and topped by a crown of pinnate, downward-arching, green fronds (to 15-20' long). Fragrant yellow flowers in elongated clusters to 4' long only appear in tropical climates where they bloom on and off throughout the year. Female flowers are followed by single-seeded coconuts (to 14"" long). Each coconut has a fibrous husk which surrounds a woody shell containing the coconut meat, milk and oil which are used in numerous food products around the world. Drinkable coconut water is the liquid inside green coconuts. Coconut milk is produced by grating the matue coconut meat, mixing it with water and then squeezing. Coconut meat can be eaten raw or cooked. Dried coconut meat (copra) is crushed to obtain coconut oil with residue sometimes added to animal feed. Coconut oil is used in cooking, cosmetics, soaps and margarine. The growing tip of this palm can be harvested and marketed under the name of heart of palm, but harvesting kills the plant.  Other plant parts have a variety of uses, particularly in the Far East, including trunk (construction), fronds (weaving, baskets, thatching), endosperm (cosmetics) and sap (palm sugar or toddy).Genus name comes from the Portuguese word coco meaning mask.Specific epithet means bearing nuts.","Problems
 Lethal yellowing is a serious disease which has killed thousands of coconut palms in Florida. It is spread by a leaf hopper. Injections help stabilize plants but will not cure the disease. Resistant varieties are being developed. Insect pest problems include palm leaf skeletonizer, aphids, nematodes and scale. Spider mites.","Garden Uses

 Easily grown as an indoor houseplant or outdoor accent plant in well-drained, humusy soil. Winter hardy in Zones 11-12. Plants need bright light for best leaf color, with some direct sun. May lose lower leaves in too much shade. Plants also prefer high humidity. Consider standing plant on bed of wet pebbles to increase humidity when indoors. Water regularly to keep soils moist, but not wet, during the growing season. Does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering from fall to late winter.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Codiaeum variegatum, commonly called croton or Joseph’s coat, is native to Malaysia, Pacific islands and northern Australia. It is a woody-based perennial that typically grows to 6’ tall. In the St. Louis area, it is grown as a 2-4’ tall houseplant or outdoor accent plant. It is noted for its bold, often striking foliage. Glossy, leathery, smoothed-edged leaves are in bright colors ranging from yellow, pink, orange, red, bronze, purple and green plus combinations thereof in patterns involving blotching and striping. Leaves are oval to lanceolate (to 18” long). Foliage color is distinctive, appearing somewhat gaudy at times.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Ternate vernacular name, kodiho.The specific epithet variegatum means variegated, in reference to the color of the foliage.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale, spider mites and mealybugs.","Garden Uses
 Use as a tropical accent in containers and border gardens. This plant is not hardy in the St. Louis area, so bring indoors before night temperatures reach 50°F or use as an annual.

 Cornus alternifolia is a small deciduous tree or large multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-25’ tall with distinctive tiered/layered horizontal branching which is upward-turned at the tips. It is native to both moist and dry forests, forest margins, stream banks and fields from Newfoundland to Minnesota south to northern Arkansas and through the Appalachians to Georgia and Alabama. Small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers bloom in flattened cymes (each to 2 1/2"" across) in late spring (May-June). Flowers give way to bluish-black fruits (drupes) on red stalks. Fruits mature in late summer. Elliptic-ovate, medium green leaves (to 3-5” long) turn reddish-purple often tinted yellow or green in fall. Although the leaves of most species of dogwood are opposite, those of pagoda dogwood are alternate, hence the specific epithet and often used common name of alternate-leaf dogwood.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood. Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the alternate arrangement of the leaves.Common name of pagoda dogwood is in reference to the tiered horizontal branching.","Problems

 Cornus canadensis, commonly known as dwarf cornel or bunchberry, is a shrubby deciduous ground cover that typically grows to 4- 9” tall and spreads in the landscape by creeping rhizomes. This dwarf species of dogwood produces the same shaped leaves and flowers found on the familiar Cornus florida tree except in smaller size. In North America, it is primarily native to coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests throughout Canada and the northern U.S., south in the Appalachians to Virginia and in the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico. This is a circumpolar species which is also native to eastern Asia.  
 

 Conspicuously-veined, oval to elliptic, glossy, medium to dark green leaves (to 1-2” long) are located near the stem tops in false whorls of 4-6. Red to purple fall color. Flowers emerge in late spring. Each flower consists of a tiny greenish-yellow umbel surrounded by four showy, oval, petal-like white bracts (each bract to 1” long). Flowers give way to terminal clusters of berry-like drupes (1/4” diameter) which ripen in August to bright red with good persistence on the plant until late fall unless earlier consumed by birds.

May be inadvisable at this time to plant this tree in areas where dogwood anthracnose infestations are present (see problems section below).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cornus florida, commonly known as flowering dogwood, is a small deciduous tree that typically grows 15-30’ tall with a low-branching, broadly-pyramidal but somewhat flat-topped habit. It arguably may be the most beautiful of the native American flowering trees. It is native from Maine to southern Ontario to Illinois to Kansas south to Florida, Texas and Mexico. It is the state tree of Missouri and Virginia. It blooms in early spring (April) shortly after, but usually overlapping, the bloom period of the redbuds. The true dogwood flowers are actually tiny, yellowish green and insignificant, being compacted into button-like clusters. However, each flower cluster is surrounded by four showy, white, petal-like bracts which open flat, giving the appearance of a single, large, 3-4” diameter, 4-petaled, white flower. Oval, dark green leaves (3-6” long) turn attractive shades of red in fall. Bright red fruits are bitter and inedible to humans (some authors say poisonous) but are loved by birds. Fruits mature in late summer to early fall and may persist until late in the year.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood. Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word flos flower in reference to its attractive spring flowers.Common name of dogwood is in probable reference to an old-time use of hard slender stems from this tree for making skewers once known as dags or dogs.","Problems
 Flowering dogwood, when stressed, is susceptible to a rather large number of disease problems, the most serious of which is dogwood anthracnose. Although this anthracnose is not yet a serious problem in Missouri, it has caused considerable devastation in parts of the eastern U.S. Plants are also susceptible to powdery mildew, leaf spot, canker, root rot and leaf and twig blight. Stressed trees also become vulnerable to borers. Leaf miner and scale are less serious potential insect pests.","Garden Uses

 Cornus kousa, commonly called Kousa dogwood, is a small, deciduous flowering tree or multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-30’ tall, with a vase-shaped habit in the early years but eventually maturing to a more rounded form. Bloom occurs in late spring. The showy parts of the Kousa dogwood “flower” (3-5” across) are the four narrowly pointed petal-like white bracts which surround the center cluster of insignificant, yellowish-green, true flowers. Flowers are followed by berry-like fruits (to 1” diameter) which mature to a pinkish red in summer and persist into fall. Fruits are technically edible, but are usually left for the birds. Oval, pointed leaves (to 4” long) are dark green, but usually turns attractive shades of reddish-purple to scarlet in autumn. Mottled, exfoliating, tan and gray bark on mature trees is attractive in winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood. Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is the Japanese name for this species.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems.

Cut foliage back to the ground in late winter. Clumps may be divided in late winter to early spring. This grass is technically gynodioecious, but usually appears dioecious. Female plants produce prodigious amounts of seed and can self-seed freely, often resulting in naturalization that displaces valuable native plants. This plant is considerably invasive in certain areas of the western U. S., particularly California and Hawaii where it is not now recommended for planting. In the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6), this grass will generally not survive winter, and should be planted in large containers (e.g., whiskey barrels) for overwintering in a greenhouse.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cortaderia selloana, commonly called pampas grass, is native to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Its common name is in obvious reference to the Argentine grasslands (the pampas) where it grows. It was planted around the world in Victorian times, and today is considered to be one of the most popular of the ornamental grasses. This is a tough, large grass that forms dense, substantial clumps (tussocks) featuring arching, serrulate, narrow green leaves that are topped in fall by huge, feathery, silvery white plumes. It was first introduced into the U. S. in 1848, and for many years now has been grown as an ornamental plant in certain southern and western parts of the U.S. It has also been grown commercially for harvest of its large flower plumes for use in dried arrangements. Leaf blades are extremely sharp (easily cut human skin) and may reach 6-8’ in length. Flower plumes (1-3’ long) may rise to 10-12’ tall on erect stems. Silvery white plumes (sometimes with traces of pink) are more impressive on female plants than on male plants.Genus name comes from the Argentinian name.","Problems

 Crataegus crus-galli, commonly called cockspur thorn, is sometimes seen as a dense, low-branched, broad-rounded tree to 25-35’ with horizontal branching armed with numerous large thorns (1.5-3” long). Lower branches often sweep near to the ground. It is also often seen as a tall, flat-topped shrub. It is native from Quebec to North Carolina and Kansas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in thickets and rocky pastures throughout the state (Steyermark). Obovate to oblong-obovate dark green leaves (to 3” long) have wedge-shaped bases. Foliage turns orange to scarlet to purple red in fall. White flowers (in corymbs to 3”) bloom in May for a period of 7-10 days. Flowers emit an unpleasant fragrance. Flowers are followed by rounded fruits (3/8” diameter) that ripen to deep red in fall (September-October) and typically persist to late fall. Fruits are technically edible, but are usually best left for the birds. The fruit is sometimes called a haw.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Crus-galli in Latin means leg of a cock in reference to the purported resemblance of the thorns of this plant to a cock’s spurs. The specific epithet of this plant is sometimes also designated as crusgalli.The white hawthorn blossom (Crataegus) is the Missouri State Flower.","Problems
 Pests and diseases are a problem with most hawthorns. Plants are susceptible to cedar-hawthorn and cedar-quince rusts (rust stage where eastern red cedars are present in the area) and fireblight. Other potential diseases include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers, apple scab, leaf blight and twig blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale. Red spider mites may also occur. Use of pesticide sprays may be advisable in areas where this plant suffers from significant diseases and insects. On species plants, numerous thorns pose significant risks for young children and also make culture/pruning more difficult.","Garden Uses

Plants are typically grown as annuals in cages, on trellises or, space permitting, along the ground. Vertical growth on a trellis may be best for var. flexuosus because the fruits will grow straighter with less curvature. Plants are intolerant of frost. Plant seeds outdoors in the garden at the last spring frost date or indoors in pots or other containers about 4-6 weeks prior to the last spring frost date. Plants thrive in hot summer daytime weather with warm nights. Pick fruits when young (older fruits toughen as they mature).  Consistent and even moisture is essential.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cucumis melo, commonly called muskmelon or sweet melon, is a scabrid or hispid, scrambling or climbing, annual or perennial plant of the gourd family. Common name is in reference to the musky smell which emanates from many of the fruits in the species when cut open. The fruits in this species vary considerably in terms of shape, size, rind, texture, flavor and flesh color. This is a polymorphic taxon that produces not only edible muskmelons (straight species) but also six different edible varieties or groups (some experts prefer the term group because variety only applies to plants in the wild) as follows: (1) var. cantalupensis (cantaloupe developed at Cantalupi near Rome), (2) var. inodorous (winter melons including casaba and honeydew), (3) var. reticulatus (netted or musk melon with netted rind and musky sweet orange flesh), (4) var. conomon (oriental pickling melon), (5) var. chito group (mango melons), (6) var. dudaim (stink melon or Queen Anne’s pocket melon), and (7) var. flexuosus (Armenian cucumber, snake or serpent melon with cucumber shape and appearance).
 

 Var. flexuosus (aka flexuosus group), most commonly called Armenian cucumber, is a frost-tender, tendril bearing annual vine that is grown for harvest of its edible, long and slender, cucumber-like fruits consumed as a vegetable. Vines will typically grow to 6-9’ long. This is an heirloom plant first cultivated in the 1400s in western Asia from Armenia and Turkey south along the eastern Mediterranean to Egypt. Although botanically a muskmelon, this fruit looks and tastes like a cucumber. The cucumber that is most commonly grown for culinary consumption is the closely related Cucumis sativus.  
 

 In frost-free climates, yellow flowers with 5-parted corollas bloom throughout much of the year. Flowers give way to slender fruits with greenish-white flesh and thin corrugated pale green rinds. Fruits are best harvested when young (e.g. about 12” long and 1” diameter), but will mature to as much as 36” long (hence the sometimes used common name of yard-long cucumber). Fruits can be eaten without peeling. Fruit flesh becomes drier and tougher as fruits mature. Stems are clad with rounded, wavy margined, rough-pubescent, shallowly and irregularly lobed leaves (to 6” across).Genus name from Latin means cucumber as derived from the Greek word kykyon also meaning cucumber.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word melopepo meaning apple-shaped melon.","Problems

 This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. It is best grown in fertile, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Seeds may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have risen to at least 65 degrees F., typically about the time of last spring frost. Distance between plants varies depending on the plant variety and growing method. In general, if row planting for bush type, place 3 seeds together 2-3' apart in rows 3-6' apart. Thin later to 1 or 2 plants per hole. Vining types need to be spaced 3-4' apart in rows 8' apart. Seed can also be started indoors about 3 weeks before the last spring frost date, with young plants set out after last frost date. Seedlings are cold sensitive.

 Squashes can be divided into two general categories: summer squash (eaten as immature fruits before seeds harden) and winter squash (eaten only after fruit has grown to maturity). Curcubia pepo is a large and diverse species that was probably first domesticated in Mexico. It primarily consists of summer squash including crookneck (var. torticollia), straightneck (var. recticollis), scallop (var. clypeata), vegetable marrow (var. fastigata), cocozzelle (var. inoga) and zucchini (var. cylindrica), but also contains several notable winter squashes including pumpkin (var. pepo) and acorn (var. turbinata). Summer squashes mature rapidly and can be harvested in as little as 50 days, while winter squashes can take over 120 to fully ripen. These squashes primarily come in vine or bush form, are usually prickly, and usually have conspicuously-lobed leaves. All varieties need ample room.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a gourd.","Problems
 Cucumber beetles carrying bacterial wilt, squash vine borers and squash bugs are the most common insect pests. Squash borers (caterpillars) tunnel into stems, causing that portion of the vine to wilt. Look for entry holes with droppings outside, make a vertical slit in the problem stem, and remove the caterpillar. Squash bugs can be removed by hand or by placing boards near the plants at night (bugs hide under the boards and can be destroyed the next morning). Additional potential insect pests include aphids, cutworms, pickleworm, leaf miners, white flies, squash bugs, and stink bugs. Watch for mites. Potential disease problems include bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, blossom end rot, downy mildew and powdery mildew. Watermelon and cucumber mosaic virus may appear.","Garden Uses

 This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. It is best grown in fertile, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Seeds may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have risen to at least 65 degrees F., typically about the time of last spring frost. Distance between plants varies depending on the plant variety and growing method. In general, if row planting for bush type, place 3 seeds together 2-3' apart in rows 3-6' apart. Thin later to 1 or 2 plants per hole. Vining types need to be spaced 3-4' apart in rows 8' apart.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10 (possibly including protected areas in Zone 8) where it is easily grown outdoors in sandy, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to shade. Perhaps best in part shade. Appreciates a good mulch. Superior soil drainage is needed. Established plants tolerate some drought. Plants also tolerate temperatures that briefly dip into the high teens but some frost damage to the foliage will occur. Plants may not survive temperatures below 15 degrees F. Plants sucker at the base. Propagation is by suckers/offsets or seed.  Very slow growth, but plants live a long time. Indoors plants should be planted in containers with a soil-based potting mix amended with sand and peat.

 Notwithstanding the common name of sago palm or King Sago palm, this cycad is botanically closer to conifers than to palms. This species in native to Kyushu (third largest Japanese island), the Ryukyu Islands and southern China. It is a very slow-growing, symmetrical plant that produces a crown of shiny, arching, palm-like, evergreen palmate leaves atop a shaggy upright trunk. Trunks take a long time to form (1"" diameter trunks may take years to eventually reach 12"" diameter). Young plants typically grow to 2-3' tall over several years, but may take 50 or more years to eventually reach 10' tall.  Arching pinnate leaves (to 3-7' long depending on age) form a loose, feather-like rosette with leaflets to 7"" long. Each leaf has a large mid-rib with very narrow, rigid, spiny-tipped, deep green leaflets. Leaflets have revolute edges (margins rolled downward), hence the specific epithet.  Young sago palm plants produce leaves intermittently in several different growth spurts per year, however mature plants only produce leaves once per year. Plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Female plants will not produce seed without a nearby male, however these plants rarely flower when grown indoors in containers. Males produce upright yellowish ellipsoid pollen cones (to 12-18"" tall). Orbicular female cones produce vermilion seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a kind of palm.Specific epithet means means rolled back.","Problems

Best with intense indirect indoor light in cool (65 degrees) locations. Plants go dormant in summer (lose most if not all leaves) and should be infrequently watered during this period. As cool fall temperatures arrive, plants begin to grow again and regular watering and fertilization should be resumed. May be grown from seed planted in late summer for first bloom the following winter (about 18 months later).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 C. persicum is native to the eastern Mediterranean. Species flowers are rose-pink to lavender-white or white. Florist's cyclamen are frost-tender hybrids derived from C. persicum. They feature clumps of long-stalked basal dark green leaves often variegated with silver blotching or veining. Solitary flowers with twisted and reflexed petals bloom from winter to spring atop leafless stems rising 6-9"" tall. These hybrids offer a much greater range of flower colors than the species, including violet, lavender, purple, pink, rose, red and white, often with red centers. In contrast to florist's cyclamen, the other type of cyclamen, species cyclamen, consists of a number of different species plants that typically are smaller (2-5"" tall) and usually have much better winter hardiness (USDA Zones 5 to 8). C. hederifolium, for example, may be grown in the ground year-round in St. Louis with a protected location and winter mulch.Genus name comes from the Greek word presumably from kylos meaning circle and referring to the rounded tubers.Specific epithet means Persian.","Problems

 Cydonia oblonga, commonly known as common quince, is a deciduous, multi-stemmed small tree or large shrub that features crooked branches clad with broad-ovate to broad-elliptic pale green leaves (to 4"" long) that are gray-hairy below. Common quince is primarily grown today for fruit production or as a dwarfing pear rootstock. It is native to rocky slopes and woodland margins in the Trans-Caucasus region which includes Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, southwestern Russia and Turkmenistan. Plants have escaped garden plantings in the U. S. (particularly in the northeast), but plants are generally not considered to be invasive. Commercial production in the U. S. is very limited (mostly in California and New York). Common quince typically grows to 10-15' (less frequently to 20') tall. Solitary, five-petaled, pale pink to white flowers (2 1/2"" diameter) bloom from leaf axils in late spring (May) on current season's growth. Immature fruits (round to pear shaped quinces to 3"" diameter) are green with gray-white shading but mature in fall to bright yellow. Fruit on cultivated varieties is usually larger. In climates with warm winters, quinces will fully ripen on the tree/shrub and can be enjoyed fresh-picked. However, in many areas where grown in the U. S., quince fruits are still very astringent in October when they first begin to ripen, hence they are usually cooked rather than consumed fresh. Quinces may be used in jellies, preserves and pies.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is evergreen (roots may be hardy to Zone 8b). In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual in gardens or in containers. It is easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but prefers full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but is best in organically rich loams with good drainage. Seed is difficult to obtain. Nurseries and seed companies generally sell starts in small pots. Fresh stalks of lemongrass (leaves and roots absent) can also be purchased from grocery stores specializing in Southeast Asian cuisine for rooting in a glass of water. Plant outside in spring after last frost date. In fall just before first frost, stalks can be harvested (cut off top leaves and save 6-"" sections of the bulbous shoot bases) and frozen for culinary use during the winter. Several leaf sections with attached roots can also be divided and potted with top leaves removed for overwintering in a bright window. These saved sections can be then used as starts for the following year. Smaller container plants can be overwintered indoors in bright light locations.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cymbopogon citratus, commonly called lemongrass, is a frost-tender clumping perennial grass that is popularly used as a lemony flavoring in Thai, Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian cooking and is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for that purpose. It is also an outstanding ornamental grass that lends great beauty to garden areas regardless of whether its culinary uses are to be tapped. In the St. Louis area, it typically forms a dense rounded clump of foliage to 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall and as wide in one growing season. Gracefully-arching, strap-shaped linear leaves (to 3’ long and to 1” wide) are light green. Leaves emit a lemony fragrance when bruised. It rarely produces flowers. Extracted plant oils have been used for many years in herbal medicines and perfumes.Genus name comes from the Greek words kymbe meaning a boat and pogon meaning a beard.Specific epithet means resembling Citrus for the scent.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this plant is best grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Shelter from strong winds. Mulch in winter near the northern parts of the growing range. Propagation is best done from division. Some cultivars may be grown from seed. This is a Mediterranean-type plant that grows best in temperate climates with cool summers and mild winters. It thrives in some parts of California. Commercial production for globe artichoke is generally limited to USDA Zone 7 and south.  Plants may be grown north of USDA Zone 7 as annuals (either as ornamentals and/or for harvest of artichokes). Some plants will not produce good buds when grown from seed as annuals (develop too slowly), but some cultivars (such as 'Imperial Star' PVP) develop buds so quickly (90 days after transplants are set out) that a good crop will reliably be produced from seed by late summer.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Cynara cardunculus (Scolymus Group), commonly called globe artichoke, is an upright columnar perennial vegetable which features lobed, jagged, deeply-serrate, green leaves and thistle-like flowers. Scolymus Group was probably developed from cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) in ancient times. In comparison to the species, Scolymus Group plants have larger flower heads, nearly spineless leaves that are less divided, and broader involucre bracts. The vegetable part of this plant is the large unopened flower bud which contains the edible heart. Flower buds appear year round in warm climates, with the major crop being in April-May and a lesser crop in fall. In cold winter climates, the major crop is in fall. Globe artichoke typically grows in a clump to 3' tall. Flower stalks rise from the clump to 4-5' tall, each stalk topped by a large terminal flower bud with several smaller buds below. Flower buds are harvested prior to opening. If buds are not harvested prior to bloom, the buds will open to spectacular violet blue thistle-like flowers with diameters to as much as 7"". Nearly all commercial artichoke production in the U.S. occurs in the State of California with 75% of that California production occurring in Monterey County. Castroville, known as the Artichoke Capital of the World, celebrates an annual Artichoke Festival in May of each year.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means resembling a small thistle.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Aphids, snails, slugs and blackfly may appear. Watch for gray mold, powdery mildew or root rot.","Garden Uses
 Globe artichokes may be grown as vegetables. Buds are harvested prior to flowering. For consumption, the bud is first steamed until the bracts are easily removable. Bracts are then removed one at a time with the fleshy edible base on each bract being eaten. Inedible choke is removed, leaving the heart. Regardless of culinary value, this plant provides excellent interest to gardens for ornamental foliage and flowers.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-9. This is a short-lived perennial that is perhaps best grown as a biennial. However, many gardeners simply purchase cold treated plants in spring and grow them as annuals. Moreover, many of the new cultivars will bloom the first year from seed if the seed is started early enough. Sweet William is best grown in deep, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun, but generally appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. In optimum growing conditions it will reseed each year and remain in the garden for many years as if it were a long-lived perennial. Double-flowered forms will not come true from seed, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flowers (shear back large plantings) promotes perennial tendencies. Seed may be planted directly in the garden in late spring for bloom the following year. Some nurseries sell seedlings in early fall that may be planted immediately for bloom the following year. Nurseries commonly sell plants in spring for flowering the same year.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Dianthus barbatus, commonly called sweet William, typically grows 12-24” tall and features small flowers held in dense, flat-topped terminal clusters (3-5” wide). Many cultivars are available in commerce, including double-flowered forms as well as some dwarf plants (4-8” tall). Flowers come in vivid shades of red, pink, white and bicolor, sometimes with a contrasting eye, and with fringed petals that are bearded on the inside. Bloom from late spring to early summer. Flowers may be fragrant, although many of the newer cultivars have no scent. Lance-shaped medium green leaves (to 4” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means bearded or with long, weak hairs.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers fertile, alkaline, somewhat gritty loams with good drainage. Tolerates some part afternoon shade, particularly in hot summer climates. Plants tend to die out in the center if drainage is not superior. Division and/or reseeding may be necessary every 2-3 years. Prompt removal of spent flowers may prolong bloom period, but is quite labor intensive. For larger plantings, it is perhaps more practical to simply shear off spent flowers after bloom. Shearing plants after bloom but before seed sets will prevent any unwanted self-seeding, will trim the foliage and may promote a possible sparse rebloom in fall. Plants are easily grown from seed and may self-seed in optimum growing conditions.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Dianthus deltoides, commonly called maiden pink, is an evergreen perennial that typically forms loose spreading mats of foliage to 4-6” tall and to 24” wide. Narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves. Heavily fringed, slightly fragrant, single flowers (to 3/4” diameter) appear on branched flowering stems (8-12” tall) in late spring, covering the foliage mound with brightly colored bloom. Species flowers are usually deep pink with a dark, pale spotted band at the base of the petals. Evergreen foliage remains attractive year-round, as long as soils are given consistent moisture during the growing season.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means triangular.“Pink” in the common name is in reference to the fringed petals that typically look as if they were cut with pinking shears.","Problems

 Dicentra eximia, commonly called fringed bleeding heart, is a native wildflower of the eastern United States that typically occurs on forest floors, rocky woods and ledges in the Appalachian Mountains. Features deeply-cut, fern-like, grayish-green, foliage which persists throughout the growing season and pink to purplish red, nodding, heart-shaped flowers carried above the foliage on long, leafless, leaning stems. Protruding inner petals of the flower appear to form a drop of blood at the bottom of each heart-shaped flower (hence the common name of bleeding heart). Plant typically grows to 15"" tall, with the flower stems and basal leaves growing directly out of the scaly rootstock. Bloom begins in late spring. In cooler climates, flowering may continue throughout the summer, but in the hotter climates, the flowering will generally stop in hot weather, with a possible rebloom occurring only when the weather cools in late summer or early fall. Similar in appearance to the showy, old garden bleeding heart from Asia, D. spectabilis, except D. spectabilis is taller and wider, its flowers are larger and its foliage is less dissected and usually goes dormant by mid-summer.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice and kentron meaning a spur for the two-spurred flowers.Specific epithet means distinguished or out of the ordinary.","Problems

 Diervilla lonicera, commonly known as bush honeysuckle, is a suckering, densely branched, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3' tall and to 4' wide. It is native to dry rocky open woodland areas and thickets from Newfoundland to Saskatchewan south to North Carolina, Tennessee and Iowa. It is noted for its small shrubby form, yellow trumpet-shaped flowers, dark green leaves and fall color. Tube-like flowers (each to 1/2"" across), resembling the flowers of true honeysuckle (genus Lonicera), bloom in panicles (cymes) in late spring to early summer (June-July). In order to taste the sweet nectar, the tubular flower must be suckled, hence the name honeysuckle. Plants are self-sterile (seed set requires pollination from a nearby plant). Flowers give rise to fruits (dry woody dehiscent capsules). Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, pointed, opposite, glossy green leaves (to 2-5"" long) with fine marginal teeth turn interesting shades of yellow to orange sometimes changing to red in fall.Genus name honors a French surgeon named Dierville or Diereville who observed with great interest a North American native bush-honeysuckle growing in Canada during an extensive trip he took to that country in 1699-1700. Upon his return to France, he introduced the shrub to European culture, with the bush-honeysuckle genus eventually being named in memory of him. Linnaeus subsequently listed the observed Canadian plant as Diervilla lonicera.Specific epithet comes from the genus name for honeysuckle (Lonicera).This species should not to be confused with Lonicera japonica, which shares the common name bush honeysuckle and is an exotic invasive species to Missouri and the Midwest by the Midwest Invasive Plant Network.","Problems

 Dypsis lutescens, commonly called bamboo palm, butterfly palm or areca palm, is native to moist forest areas in Madagascar.  Although endangered in its native habitat, it is commonly available in commerce throughout the world for outdoor plantings (where winter hardy) or as a houseplant. This multi-stemmed palm is now considered to be the most popular palm sold as a houseplant. Outdoors it will typically grow to 12-30' tall. Multiple-ringed, cane-like, yellow stems grow from the base of the plant in clusters. Stems sometimes resemble bamboo when suckers are removed, hence the common name of bamboo palm. Stems are topped with pinnate, upward-curving, light green leaves (to 3-6' long) with yellow midribs. Each leaf has 40-60 1/2 to 3/4"" lance-shaped leaflets per side.  Yellow flowers bloom in summer in panicles to 2' long. Flowers are not particularly showy. Flowers are followed by small yellow-orange fruits (each to 1/2"" long) that mature to nearly black. Another common name for this palm is golden cane palm in reference to its yellow stems.  
 

 Synonymous with and formerly known as Chrysalidocarpus lutescens.Specific epithet means turning yellow in reference to the yellow flowers, stems and leaf midribs.","Problems

This is a vigorous, fast-growing plant that tolerates a wide variety of soils including both poor dry soils and wet heavy clays. Also tolerates wind, summer heat and saline conditions. Performs poorly in humid summer climates, however, and is not recommended for planting in the deep South (south of USDA Zone 7). Can spread by root suckers and self seeding.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Elaeagnus angustifolia, commonly called Russian olive or oleaster is native to Europe and Asia. It is a small, usually thorny, deciduous tree or large shrub that is typically grown for its silvery foliage, small fragrant yellow flowers, olive-like fruit and ease of cultivation. It has been widely planted in North America as both a windbreak and an ornamental. As a tree, it typically grows 12-20’ tall. It responds well to clipping and can be grown much shorter as a hedge. Branches and trunk are covered with exfoliating brown bark that is attractive in winter. Twigs are occasionally thorny. Narrow, willow-like leaves (to 2” long) are dark green above and silvery beneath. Angustifolia means narrow-leaved. Fragrant apetalous flowers with four lobed calyces appear in clusters of 1-3 in leaf axils near the base of new shoots in late spring. Flowers are silvery white outside and yellowish inside. Flowers are followed in fall by an often abundant crop of berry-like, silver-scaled fruit resembling olives, hence the common name. Fruit is edible, and is sometimes used for making preserves. Fruit is also attractive to wildlife. Although relatively tame in the St. Louis climate, Russian olive has aggressively naturalized in many parts of the West, particularly in watersheads and marshlands of the Great Plains where it has self-seeded and spread along rivers and wetland areas, crowding out native plants such as cottonwoods and willows, to the point where it is now being considered a noxious weed.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.","Problems

May spread by suckering. May self seed in the garden. Plants have shown some invasive tendencies (animals and birds help disperse seed) by escaping into natural areas in the southeastern U.S. Best propagated by cuttings. If planted in areas where growth needs to be restrained, this shrub requires constant pruning to keep it in bounds.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Elaeagnus pungens, commonly called thorny elaeagnus or silverthorn, is native to China and Japan. It is a large, sprawling, durable, broad-leaved evergreen shrub that typically grows to 12-15' tall. Young branchlets are covered with brown scales. Branchlets are usually spiny. Wavy-margined, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3.5"" long) are lustrous green above but silvery-white and dotted with tiny brown scales below. Small, apetalous, bell-shaped, creamy white flowers (to 1/4"" long) bloom in axillary clusters in late fall (October-November). Flowers are not particularly showy, but are intensely fragrant (some suggest gardenia-scented). Small, one-seeded, reddish-brown fruits (drupes to 1/2"" long) typically ripen in spring (late March-May). Fruits are technically edible, but perhaps best left for the birds.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means sharp-pointed in reference to the sharp thorny spines found on this species.Common names are also in reference to the spines.","Problems

 Best grown in medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates an extremely wide range of soils, however. Will grow in up to 4” of standing water. Spreads to form large colonies in the wild. Homeowners are often more interested in learning how to eradicate this plant from the landscape than how to grow it. It is a very aggressive plant which, if not preemptively restrained, will spread aggressively by branched, creeping rhizomes. Once established, it can be extremely difficult to remove by digging because its rhizomes spread wide and deep, and any small section of rhizome left behind can sprout a new plant. Consider using soil barriers to restrict growth. In water gardens or tub gardens, plant in pots at water bottom to contain growth (both height and spread).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Equisetum hyemale, commonly called scouring rush or rough horsetail, is a non-flowering, rush-like, rhizomatous, evergreen perennial which typically grows 3-5’ tall and is native to large portions of Eurasia, Canada and the U.S., including Missouri. It typically occurs in wet woods, moist hillsides and peripheries of water bodies (lakes, rivers, ponds). This species features rigid, rough, hollow, vertically-ridged, jointed-and-segmented, bamboo-like, dark green stems (to 1/2” diameter at the base) which rise up from the plant rhizomes. Each stem node (joint) is effectively marked by a whorl of tiny, stem-clasping, scale-like leaves which are fused into an ash-gray sheath (1/4” long) ending in a fringe of teeth. Teeth are usually shed during the growing season. Each sheath is set off and accentuated, both above and below, by thin, stem-ringing, black bands. Photosynthesis is basically carried on by the stems of this plant. Vegetative and fertile stems are alike in this species, with some vegetative stems bearing, at the stem tips, pine cone-like fruiting heads (to 1” long) which contain numerous spores. The evergreen stems are particularly noticeable in winter and can provide significant interest to the landscape. Stems have a high silica content and were used by early Americans for polishing pots and pans, hence the common name of scouring rush. Equisetum is not a rush however. Nor is it a fern. Equisetum is the single surviving genus of a class of primitive vascular plants that dates back to the mid-Devonian period (350 + million years ago). Today, the equisetums are categorized as fern allies in large part because they, like the ferns, are non-flowering, seedless plants which reproduce by spores.Genus name comes from the Latin words equus meaning a horse and seta meaning a bristle.Specific epithet means of winter or flowering is winter.

Good resistance to drought. Plants spread by self-seeding and by stems rooting along the ground at the nodes. Propagate by seed or division in spring.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Eragrostis spectabilis, commonly called purple love grass, is a warm season bunchgrass that is native to sandy soils from Maine to South Dakota south to Florida, Texas, Arizona and Mexico. In Missouri, it is found throughout the State, most commonly in sandy, rocky or open ground and along roads, fencerows and railroads (Steyermark). Flat, coarse, mostly basal, green leaves (to 10"" long and 3/8"" wide) form a somewhat disorganized clump of foliage that typically rises to 10"" tall. Soft reddish-purple flowers in a loose, open inflorescence appear in August, forming an airy cloud that covers the grass clump and raises the overall height of the plant to 24"" tall. Flowers lose color and turn brown by October. As the seeds mature, the inflorescence usually detaches from the plant and blows along the ground like a tumbleweed distributing seed as it goes.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet means spectacular or showy.","Problems

 Eragrostis trichodes, commonly called sand love grass, is a warm season bunchgrass that is native from Ohio to Nebraska and south to Louisiana and Texas. It is densely tufted and typically rises to 2-4’ tall on generally weak stems. In Missouri, it is most commonly found in open sandy woods or in sandy areas along streams or railroad tracks (Steyermark). It features narrow, mostly flat, shiny dark green blades (to 6-30” long by 1/4” wide). Purple tinted flowers appear in loose, open panicles in July-August. Flower stems do not rise well above the foliage which detracts from the overall plant appearance. Mature plants turn bronze in fall and have continued interest into winter.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet means hairy or shaggy.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Good drainage is important for this plant. Cut back stems after flowering to encourage additional bloom. Tolerates some light shade, particularly in hot summer climates.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Erigeron is a genus of about 200 species of annuals, biennials and perennials from dry grassland and mountainous areas of predominantly North America. Erigerons are similar in appearance to and sometimes confused with asters.Genus name comes from the Greek words eri meaning early and geron meaning old man in reference to the early bloom time and downy plant appearance suggestive of the white beard of an old man.Plants in the genus Erigeron are often commonly called fleabane as a result of a once widely held theory that these plants repel fleas.'Darkest of All' is a hybrid erigeron cultivar which probably features E. speciosus as a prominent parent. It features large flowers (to 2"" across) with deep violet rays and yellow center disks atop stiff stems rising to 2' tall from a basal clump of lance-shaped green leaves (3-6"" long). Smaller lance-shaped stem leaves. Blooms in summer with some intermittent rebloom extending into early fall. 'Darkest of All' is a translation of the original German cultivar name of 'Dunkelste Aller'.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is best grown in fertile, evenly moist, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Best with consistent moisture, but established plants will tolerate some drought. Plants may survive temperatures to as low as 10-15 degrees F., but flowers and fruits will normally perish if temperatures dip below 28 degrees F. In St. Louis, plants may be grown in containers as houseplants. Containers may be taken outside in summer. Indoors, containers are best sited in sunny windows with moderate temperatures of 50-70 degrees F. Reduce watering in winter.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Eriobotrya japonica, commonly called loquat, Japanese medlar or Japanese plum, is a small, short-trunked, upward-branching, broadleaf evergreen tree that typically grows to 10-25' tall with a round form. It also often grows as a large spreading shrub. It is generally noted for its compact size, attractive foliage, fragrant flowers and edible fruit. Loquat is native to China and perhaps Japan. Wrinkled, strongly-veined, leathery, elliptic-lanceolate leaves (to 12"" long) with toothed margins are dark green above and light green covered with rusty down beneath. Sweetly fragrant, five-petaled, white flowers in large panicles (to 6"" long) bloom in late fall-early winter. Flowers are followed by small spherical to pear-shaped fruits (to 1-2"" long), each with juicy flesh and one to several large seeds. Fruits typically ripen in spring (February in Florida and April in California). Fruits have smooth to downy, yellow to orange skin. Fruits are excellent when eaten fresh off the tree or in salads, sauces, jellies/jams or tarts/pies. Many different fruiting cultivars exist in commerce.Genus name comes from the Greek words erion meaning wool and botrys meaning a cluster of grapes for the woolly, clustered panicles.Specific epithet means of Japan.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. This rose family member is susceptible to fire blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, scale, fruit flies and caterpillars. Potential disease pests include rots, cankers, scab, leaf spot and blight. Seeds and young plant leaves are mildly poisonous if ingested. In areas where fruit set occurs, fruit drop can cause troublesome litter problems.","Garden Uses
 In frost free areas, plants are grown commercially for fruit production or as landscape ornamentals near decks or patios. Good street tree in areas where fruit does not set. Effective houseplants in colder climates.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 This annual is typically grown in home gardens for culinary use as a lettuce-like salad green. It thrives in rich moist soils in full sun to part shade. It is best grown during the cooler spring and fall months of the year rather than in the heat of the summer. After last spring frost date, sow seeds in the garden a few inches apart in rows about 18” apart, with seedlings later thinned to a spacing of about 12”. In the alternative, seeds may be started indoors in containers prior to last spring frost date for later transplanting outdoors. Leaves must be harvested when young and tender. Leaf flavor becomes strong and often bitter as the leaves mature. A second crop can be planted in late summer for harvest before fall frost. Although this annual may self-seed in the garden, it is usually recommended that seed be purchased rather than harvested from garden plants. In St. Louis, seeds typically germinate in May with leaves harvested in early summer. By contrast, this plant also grows as a winter annual, albeit sometimes an invasive one, in some other parts of the U.S. such as the deserts of Arizona where seeds typically germinate in the wild after fall rains for growth over winter.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Eruca vesicaria, commonly known as by a number of common names including arugula, garden rocket, rocket salad, roka, roquette, rucola or rugula, is a Eurasian annual herb of the mustard family. It was first cultivated by ancient Greeks and Romans. It continues to be widely cultivated in Europe today, but has also been introduced into many other parts of the world including much of North America where it has become not only a treasured culinary plant, but also, in some cases, an invasive garden escapee and self-seeder. It typically naturalizes in disturbed habitats, fields and meadows.  
 

 Plants typically grow to 10-24” tall. Irregular, pinnately-lobed, basal leaves, each with 4 to 10 small lateral lobes and a large terminal lobe, appear in rosettes. Uppermost stem leaves are entire and smaller. Four-petalled flowers (to 1” long) bloom in corymbs. Each flower has a pale yellow corolla, yellow stamens, and dark brown or purple veins. Fruit (to 1.5” long) is a seeded, prominently-beaked pod.  
 

 Leaves should only be harvested when young and tender. Older leaves become bitter and lose significant culinary quality as they mature. Young leaves lack bitterness and are typically eaten raw, adding a peppery, some say nutty, mustard-like flavor to a variety of food dishes including salads, sandwiches, egg dishes, sauces, soups or stir fries. Notwithstanding its culinary virtues, this plant is also extensively cultivated in central and western Asia for its seed oil which is used as a lubricant and illuminant in pickling.

It is the only eucalyptus tree that is indigenous to the northern hemisphere. In its native habitat, it will mature to as much as 250' tall with a trunk diameter of 6'. Outside its native habitat, it will typically grow much shorter (to 100-125' tall). It is perhaps best noted for its smooth orange-tinted trunk bark which peels in summer to reveal a unique and sometimes stunning multi-colored bark (as described by the common name of rainbow eucalyptus) consisting of streaks of pale green, red, orange, gray and purple-brown. Outside tropical settings, the bark is typically much less colorful. Acuminate, lance-shaped leaves (to 6"" long) are aromatic when crushed. Tiny white flowers in axillary or terminal compound inflorescences (panicles of 7-flowered umbels) bloom at various times during the year depending upon location. Trees are a source of hardwood timber.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.","Problems

It is the only eucalyptus tree that is indigenous to the northern hemisphere. In its native habitat, it will mature to as much as 250' tall with a trunk diameter of 6'. Outside its native habitat, it will typically grow much shorter (to 100-125' tall). It is perhaps best noted for its smooth orange-tinted trunk bark which peels in summer to reveal a unique and sometimes stunning multi-colored bark (as described by the common name of rainbow eucalyptus) consisting of streaks of pale green, red, orange, gray and purple-brown. Outside tropical settings, the bark is typically much less colorful. Acuminate, lance-shaped leaves (to 6"" long) are aromatic when crushed. Tiny white flowers in axillary or terminal compound inflorescences (panicles of 7-flowered umbels) bloom at various times during the year depending upon location. Trees are a source of hardwood timber.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates close to full shade, but usually at the expense of diminished fall color quality. This is an adaptable shrub that tolerates a wide range of soils except for wet, poorly-drained ones. Plants appreciate consistent moisture, particularly when grown in full sun locations.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Euonymus alatus, commonly called winged euonymus, burning bush, winged burning bush or winged spindle tree, is a dense, mounded, spreading, flat-topped, multi-stemmed shrub that is particularly noted for its fiery red fall foliage color. It is native to forests, woodlands and scrub areas in eastern Russia, Japan, China and Korea. It was introduced into the U.S. around 1860 as an ornamental, and over time has become an extremely popular shrub for homes, commercial properties and along highways. This shrub will mature over time to 15-20' tall, but is often pruned shorter. Elliptic to obovate, crenulate to serrulate, green leaves (to 3” long) turn bright red in fall. Fall color can be spectacular. Small, yellowish-green flowers appear in May but are not showy. Small fruits (1/3” red capsules) ripen in fall. Fruit capsules split open when ripe to reveal the tiny seeds (each encased in a fleshy orange-red aril). Seeds are attractive to certain birds who eat and distribute them. Greenish-brown stems have distinctive corky ridges (""wings"" as used in the common name). Corky-winged stems are more noticeable in winter after leaf drop. Winged euonymus has escaped plantings and naturalized in at least 21 eastern and mid-western states. In some areas, it is now considered to be a threat to native plants because of its ability to establish itself in woodlands, forests, fields, roadsides and disturbed areas where, if conditions are favorable, it will out-compete native plants to form dense thickets.Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet means winged.More compact forms (4-10' tall) are also available (e.g., Euonymus alatus 'Compactus' and Euonymus alatus 'Rudy Haag').","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where plants are best grown in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants react poorly to temperatures that dip below 35 degrees F. in winter. Appreciates some midday shade in hot summer climates. Plants are tolerant of poor soils, including rocky-sandy ones. Plants are also tolerant of dry soils, but regular applications of moderate moisture may result in better bloom with less leaf drop. Wet soils, particularly in winter, can be fatal. Best located in areas with good air circulation. Indoor plants need bright light and are best grown with a gritty soil-based potting mix. Propagate from tip cuttings. Wear gloves when working with this plant. Sticky white latex sap is poisonous (avoid contact with skin, mouth or eyes).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Euphorbia milii, commonly called crown of thorns, is a woody, succulent shrub that features (a) fleshy, bright green leaves, (b) inconspicuous flowers in clusters subtended by very showy petal-like red or yellow bracts and (c) thick sharp black thorns (to 1/2"" long) which cover its water-storing branches and stems.  Common name refers to the belief by some that the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ at the crucifixion was made from stems of this plant (historical evidence suggests this Madagascar native may have been introduced to the Middle East prior to the birth of Christ). In Madagascar, this shrub typically grows in a sprawling form to 5-6' tall. Outdoors in southern Florida, it typically grows to 3' tall. As a houseplant, it grows at best to 2' tall. Obovate bright green leaves (to 2 1/2"" long) have wedge-shaped bases. Leaves are produced on new stem growth. Inconspicuous greenish true flowers, borne in cyathia, lack both petals and sepals, but are subtended by long-lasting, colorful, petal-like, bright red or yellow bracts which are exceptionally showy. In tropical and sub-tropical locations, flowers will bloom throughout the year, but primarily in spring and summer. In Florida, flowers bloom primarily in winter and spring. Houseplants often bloom from late winter well into fall. Many cultivars are available in commerce.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet honors Baron Milius, one-time Governor of the island of Bourbon, who reportedly introduced this species to cultivation in France in 1821.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Use gloves when working with this plant. Some gardeners experience skin rashes from contact with the toxic plant sap of euphorbias. Potential disease pests include leaf spots, stem and root rots and botrytis blight. Potential insect pests include scale, mealybug and thrips. Watch for mites.

 Euphorbia pulcherrima, commonly called poinsettia, is the most widely grown of all shrubby euphorbias. In Mexico it is a straggly deciduous shrub. Inconspicuous yellow flowers are surrounded by large brilliant red floral bracts (modified leaves) in winter through spring. Contrary to conventional wisdom, poinsettia plants are not a poisonous plant. A Ohio State University study showed that a 50 pound child could eat 500 bracts and might have a slight stomach ache. However, the white sap can have allergic properties, especially for people who have latex allergies.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet means pretty.The common name of poinsettia recognizes Joel R. Poinsette (1775-1851) a gardener, botanist and diplomat from South Carolina who was ambassador to Mexico in 1824. He brought the plant back to South Carolina.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it may be grown as a perennial. North of Zone 10, it is typically grown as an annual. Plants perform well in average, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid wet soils. Plants dislike the hot and humid summers of the deep South. In St. Louis, purchase plants in cell packs from local nurseries in spring. Plants may also be grown from seed started indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date so plants will produce good bloom in advance of the onset of hot summer weather. In cool summer climates, seed may be sown outdoors in the ground around the last spring frost date. Cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Felicia amelloides, commonly called blue daisy or blue marguerite, is native to South Africa. It is a bushy, aster-like, woody-based subshrub that typically grows to 2’ tall. It is primarily grown for its long and showy bloom of daisy-like flowers (to 1.5” diameter) featuring sky blue rays and yellow centers. In cool northern summers, flowers bloom throughout summer into fall (sometimes to frost). In hot southern summers, flowering usually declines or stops by mid-summer as consistent high temperatures become the norm. Rough-hairy, ovate green leaves (to 1” long) resemble leaves in the genus Amellus (also native to South Africa), hence the specific epithet. Felicia amelloides is synonymous with and formerly known as Felicia aethiopica, Aster amelloides, Aster capensis and Aster coelestis.Genus name honors Felix, a German official at Regensburg, who died in 1846.Specific epithet means resemble the genus Amellus.","Problems

 Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but best foliage color is in full sun. Tolerant of some drought and poor soils, but best performance occurs when plants receive regular and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Intolerant of wet, poorly-drained soils. In the St. Louis area, foliage is semi-evergreen in that it may retain some color in mild winters, but clumps will show considerable browning in harsh winters. Clumps tend to die out in the center and need to be divided and replanted or replaced every 2-3 years. Cut back foliage in early spring to 3-4” to tidy clumps and to facilitate emergence of the new leaf blades. Clumps may decline in hot, humid summers, and should be cut back if such occurs.

 Festuca amethystine, commonly known as tufted fescue, hair fescue or large blue fescue, is an evergreen to semi-evergreen, tufted, fine-textured, blue-green, cool season grass with thin hair-like blades that typically grows in dense fountain-like clumps to 12” tall. Slender stalks rise above the foliage in late spring to early summer (June) to 18-24” tall bearing terminal panicles of amethyst (violet) flowers. Color of the grass ranges from blue-green to gray-blue. This grass is native to Central Europe.Genus name comes from the Latin word meaning a grass stalk or straw.Specific epithet means violet-colored.‘Klose’ is an ornamental cultivar that is noted for its attractive olive green foliage. It typically forms a foliage clump to a compact 8” tall. Foliage emerges bluish-green in spring, maturing to olive green. It may bronze in hot summers. Foliage typically forms a tuft of erect to arching, needle-like blades radiating upward and outward to a height of 6-8” (inflorescences typically bring total clump height to 10-14”). Light green flowers with a purple tinge appear in terminal panicles atop slender stalks rising well above the foliage in late spring to early summer. Flowers give way to buffy seed heads which some gardeners find attractive but others find detractive to both the symmetry of the plant and the foliage color.

Water regularly during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering. Reduce watering from fall to late winter. This plant may be taken outside in spring after last frost date and brought back inside in fall. Prune to shape as needed.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Ficus benjamina, commonly called weeping fig, is native from India to northern Australia. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree that grows to 50’ tall. It is widely grown in the tropics as an ornamental tree or hedge. For many years, it has been an extremely popular indoor houseplant because of its attractive shape and tolerance for a variety of growing conditions. Houseplants are more often grown in the 2-10’ tall range. Pale brownish trunk with a dense cone of foliage. Trunks are sometimes braided for ornamental interest. Glossy, pointed, oval to elliptic leaves (to 4” long). Twigs arch gracefully. Stems have milky sap. This tree rarely flowers or fruits indoors. Even if flowers were produced, fruit production would still be unlikely in large part because of the absence of the necessary pollinating wasps.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Ficus carica the edible fig.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale, aphids, mealybugs, thrips and spider mites. Dieback and leaf spots may occur.

 Figs are best grown in USDA Zones 8-10 in organically rich, moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Figs may be grown in protected locations in USDA Zones 6 and 7 (e.g., against south-facing walls) with root mulch, but plants will usually show significant die back in cold winters. When temperatures in winter dip below 15 degrees F., consider additional protection for outdoor plants to the extent possible (e.g., clear plastic sheets or frames). In USDA Zones 5 and 6, figs can be grown as low-branching shrubs that are “laid down” in winter (branches are bent over and covered with soil with soil also mounded over the main trunking). Many fig cultivars are now available, with ‘Brown Turkey’ and ‘Chicago Hardy’ being noted for having unusually good winter hardiness. In St. Louis, plants are best grown in containers in full sun. Water regularly during the growing season but reduce watering in fall. Containers must be brought indoors in winter. Large containers may be overwintered in greenhouses, garages or basements.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Ficus carica, commonly called common fig, is a deciduous shrub (to 10-15’ tall) or small tree (to 15-30’ tall). It is noted for its spreading habit, attractive foliage and edible fruit. Old trees with smooth silver-gray bark (sometime gnarled with age) are ornamentally attractive. Large, palmate, hairy, 3-5 lobed leaves (to 10” long) are rough dark green above and smooth light green beneath. Non-showy greenish flowers form in spring inside hollow receptacles near the branch growing tips. The fruit (edible fig) develops within each receptacle. The main fruit crop ripens in late summer or fall on new wood. In some areas, a lesser crop may appear in spring on new wood. Species plants as well as most fig cultivars are parthenocarpic (fruits develop without cross pollination).Genus name comes from the Latin name for Ficus carica the edible fig.Specific epithet refers to Caria, a district in Asia Minor known for growing figs.","Problems

 Fothergilla gardenii, commonly known as dwarf fothergilla or coastal fothergilla, is a slow-growing, deciduous, dwarf ornamental shrub that is native to moist lowland coastal plain bogs and savannahs in the southeastern U.S. from North Carolina to the Florida panhandle and Alabama. It is a compact, slow-growing, mounded, deciduous shrub that typically grows 2-3’ tall and as wide. Apetalous flowers in dense terminal bottlebrush-like spikes (to 1-2"" long) bloom in spring (April-early May) before the leaves appear. Only the male flowers have color (showy white filaments and yellow anthers). Flowers are aromatic. Thick, pubescent, oblong to obovate, blue-green to green leaves (to 2 1/2"" long) have marginal teeth from mid point to leaf apex and are rounded at the base. Leaves turn often brilliant shades of yellow, orange and red in fall. Fruit is an ornamentally insignificant, two-seeded, beaked capsule that matures in fall.Genus name honors Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), English physician and botanist who grew plants from around the world in his London garden.Specific epithet honors Alexander Garden (1730-1791), Scottish physician and plant enthusiast, who took up residence in Charleston, South Carolina in 1752 and first discovered, described and introduced Fothergilla gardenii to England.","Problems

 Fothergilla major, commonly called large fothergilla, tall fothergilla or mountain witch alder, is a member of the same family as witch hazel (Hamamelis). It is native to the southeastern U.S., primarily in mountain woods, ravines and along stream banks in the southern Appalachians in North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. It is a slow-growing, deciduous shrub that grows 6-10’ tall with an upright spreading habit. It is noted for its aromatic spring flowers, quality summer foliage, excellent fall color and excellent disease resistance. Terminal, bottlebrush-like spikes (1-3” long) of tiny, fragrant, apetalous, white flowers bloom in spring (April-early May) after the foliage emerges. Flower color comes from the dense clusters of showy stamens (white filaments and yellowish anthers). Ovate to obovate dark green leaves (2-4” long) are leathery above and blue-gray beneath. Leaves are typically toothed in the upper 2/3 of the leaf. Foliage turns excellent shades of yellow, orange and red-purple in fall. Fruit is a non-ornamental, beaked, egg-shaped two-seeded capsule (to 1/2” long) which matures in fall, eventually bursting and explosively broadcasting the seed. Fothergilla major is very similar to Fothergilla gardenia (native to coastal plains in the southeastern U.S.), except, inter alia, Fothergilla major is (1) taller, (2) produces flowers as the leaves emerge, (3) leaves have more marginal teeth and (4) leaves are less pubescent on the undersides.Genus name honors Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), English physician and botanist who grew plants from around the world in his London garden.Specific epithet means bigger or larger.","Problems

 Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Prefers organically rich, sandy loams. Strawberries are a high maintenance fruit crop which can be grown all over the United States. Growing recommendations can vary considerably depending upon the climate, however, and varieties are often regionally adapted. Grow only certified disease-resistant cultivars. University Extension, University of Missouri-Columbia publishes a pamphlet called ""Home Fruit Production: Strawberries and Their Culture"" (G 6135) which provides some basic information on growing strawberries in Missouri and is available for inspection or purchase at the Center for Home Gardening.Plants generally dislike high summer heat, humidity and strong drying winds.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Strawberries are a mainstay of the home fruit garden and are grouped into Junebearing and everbearing types. Junebearers produce one crop per year early in the season (typically June). The berries of Junebearers are normally larger than the berries produced by everbearing or day-neutral plants. They are sensitive to the length of day, and send out runners in spring as day length increases. Everbearing types produce a first crop in spring and then subsequent crops at six week intervals thereafter throughout the summer and into fall. Unlike junebearers, everbearers are not sensitive to the length of day. Both have five-petaled, white flowers with yellow centers. Flowers give way to large, glossy, red berries which mature in late spring to early summer.Genus name comes from the Latin word fraga meaning strawberry presumably from fragrans meaning fragrant in reference to the perfume of the fruit.'Mara des Bois' was hybridized in Soings En Sologne France in 1991 by strawberry breeder Jacques Marionnet in a planned breeding program involving a cross of (F. 'Gento' x F. 'Osara') x (F. 'Red Gauntlet' x F. 'Korona'). It is a remontant (everbearing) variety that produces fruit in summer to early fall in the first year, but in subsequent years produces a heavy spring crop with continued production throughout the growing season. Plants typically grow to 12-15"" tall and spread to 12-24"" wide. Conical red berries are plump, fragrant, sweet and exceedingly tasty. Berries are small to medium (acorn size), which puts them in the category of being much smaller than most commercially grown berries but larger and firmer than tiny wild strawberries. U.S. Plant Patent PP8,517 was issued on December 28, 1993. This patent expires in September of 2011.","Problems
 Strawberries are susceptible to a large number of potential diseases, including but not limited to: foliage diseases (leaf spot, scorch), root rots (red stele, black root rot), fruit rots (anthracnose, leather rot), gray mold and viruses. Tarnished plant bugs, mites, aphids, leafrollers, slugs, nematodes and strawberry weevils are occasional insect problems.","Garden Uses
 Strawberries have little special ornamental value and are usually grown as a fruit crop in a specific area set aside for the same.May be grown in beds or containers (strawberry jars). By reputation, 'Mara des Bois' has the best flavor and fragrance of any strawberry currently in cultivation. Unfortunately, picked berries have a shelf life of only 5 days which is fine for home production or for local sales, but way too short a time for commercial production and shipment.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Fragaria vesca, commonly called woodland strawberry, is a small-fruited, everbearing wild strawberry that is native to Europe and Asia. Varieties of the species are found in North America both naturally and as introduced. This is a compact, stemless, 4-8” tall plant that spreads indefinitely by runners that root as they go. Numerous, small, 5-petaled white flowers with yellow centers appear throughout summer. Tri-foliate, coarsely-toothed, green leaves. Flowers are followed by edible, bright red strawberries (1/2” long) that may be harvested throughout summer. Flowers and fruit are usually simultaneously present on plants in summer. Although Steyermark finds F. vesca var. americana to be present in Missouri, the common wild strawberry of Missouri is a similar species, F. virginiana var. illinoensis.Genus name comes from the Latin word fraga meaning strawberry presumably from fragrans meaning fragrant in reference to the perfume of the fruit.Specific epithet means edible.","Problems
 Strawberries are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including anthracnose, leaf spots, rots, wilts, powdery mildew and blights. Insect visitors include spider mites and aphids.

 Fraxinus excelsior, commonly called European ash or common ash, is native to Europe and western Asia. It is a large, rounded, deciduous tree that grows to 70-80’ (less frequently to 140’) tall.  It is a popular landscape tree in Europe, but has not been very popular in the U.S., in part because of its susceptibility to borers.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word excelsus meaning lofty or high.","Problems
 Emerald ash borer is native to Asia. It was first discovered in the U. S. (southeastern Michigan) in 2002. It has now spread to a number of additional states in the northeast and upper Midwest, and is expected to continue spreading. Emerald ash borer will typically kill an ash tree within 3-5 years after infestation. Once infestation occurs, it is very difficult to eradicate this pest which feeds under the bark and bores into wood. This borer now constitutes a serious threat to all species of ash in North America. European ash trees are generally susceptible to a number of additional insect problems including ash borer, lilac borer, carpenter worm, oyster shell scale, leaf miners, fall webworms, ash sawflies and ash leaf curl aphid. Potential disease problems include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, rust, anthracnose, cankers and ash yellows. General ash decline is also a concern. Brittle branches are susceptible to damage from high winds and snow/ice.","Garden Uses

 Fraxinus pennsylvanica, commonly called green ash, has the largest growing range of any of the native ashes, extending from Nova Scotia to Alberta south to Florida and Texas. This is a lowland species that is commonly found throughout the State of Missouri in low woods, floodplains and along streams, ponds and sloughs (Steyermark). It is a medium sized tree, typically growing 50-70’ tall. Young trees are pyramidal in shape, gradually maturing to a more rounded but usually irregular crown. Green ash is similar in appearance to white ash (see Fraxinus americana), except, inter alia, (a) flowers appear after the foliage emerges, (b) leaflet undersides are green, (c) leaflets are toothed from midleaf to tip and (d) leaflet stalks are winged. Green ash is primarily dioecious (separate male and female trees). Clusters of apetalous purplish male and female flowers appear on separate trees in April-May after the foliage emerges. Fertilized female flowers give way to drooping clusters of winged samaras (to 2” long) that ripen in fall and may persist on the tree throughout winter. Features odd-pinnate compound leaves, each with 5-9 leaflets. Oval to oblong-lanceolate leaflets (3-4” long) are medium green above and below. Foliage turns yellow in fall, with the quality of the fall color often varying considerably from year to year. Gray-brown bark develops distinctive diamond-shaped ridging on mature trees.  As with white ash, the wood of green ash is commercially used for a variety of products including tool handles, oars, garden furniture and sports equipment.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.Specific epithet means of Pennsylvania.","Problems
 Emerald ash borer is native to Asia. It was first discovered in the U.S. (southeastern Michigan) in 2002. It has now spread to a number of additional states in the northeast and upper Midwest, and is expected to continue spreading. Emerald ash borer will typically kill an ash tree within 3-5 years after infestation. Once infestation occurs, it is very difficult to eradicate this pest which feeds under the bark and bores into wood. This borer now constitutes a serious threat to all species of ash in North America. Green ash trees are generally susceptible to a number of additional insect problems including ash borer, lilac borer, carpenter worm, oyster shell scale, leaf miners, fall webworms, ash sawflies and ash leaf curl aphid. Potential disease problems include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, rust, anthracnose, cankers and ash yellows. General ash decline is also a concern.

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Becomes weedy and sparse with diminished flowering performance if not grown in full sun. Does poorly in wet, poorly draining conditions. Will adapt to clay soil if properly amended. In USDA Zones 5 and 6, this plant will often die to the ground in winter and therefore is often grown therein in the manner of an herbaceous perennial. Even if plants do not die to the ground in winter, they often grow more vigorously, produce superior flowers and maintain better shape if cut close to the ground in late winter each year. Prompt removal of spent flower spikes during the growing season will usually encourage continued bloom until frost. This shrub will naturalize, sometimes aggressively, by self-seeding (seed dispersed by wind), particularly in areas where it does not die back in winter. Where self-seeding is a potential problem, remove spent flower clusters prior to formation/disbursement of seed.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Buddleja davidii, commonly called butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub that is native to thickets on mountain slopes, limestone outcrops, forest clearings and rocky stream banks in China. It typically grows to 6-12’ (less frequently to 15’) tall with a spread to 4-15’ wide when not killed back by cold winter temperatures. It is noted for its bushy habit, arching stems, showy/fragrant flowers and vigorous growth. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in the eastern U.S. plus Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii. It has been declared a noxious weed in Oregon and Washington. Aggressive spreading has been observed in a number of eastern states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina. 
 

 Spike-like terminal and axillary flower clusters bloom from early to late summer, sometimes to first frost. Flowers are densely clustered in showy cone-shaped panicles from 6-18” long. In the wild, straight species flowers are lilac to purple with orange-yellow throats. Numerous named cultivars have been introduced over the years, expanding the range of flower colors to include pinks, yellows, whites and reds. Flowers (each to ½” long) are mildly fragrant, and, as the common name suggests, very attractive to butterflies. Flowers are also very attractive to hummingbirds and bees. Flowers give way to two-valved seed capsules that split open when ripe (about 50 seeds per capsule). Finely toothed, elliptic to lanceolate leaves (6-10” long) taper to long points. Leaves are sage green above and white tomentose beneath.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.
 

 The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia. However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet honors Pere Armand David (1826-1900), French missionary and naturalist, who found this species growing in China in 1869/1870 along the border of China and Tibet.Common name refers to the plant being very attractive to butterflies.'PIIBD-II', part of the First Editions® series, is commonly sold under the trade name of FIRST EDITIONS® FUNKY FUCHSIA™. It was selected by Michael Dirr of Plant Introductions, Inc. and is distributed by Bailey Nurseries. It is a rounded to upright shrub with dark green foliage that is gray underneath. FUNKY FUCHSIA™ has upright 6 to 8 in. (sometimes up to 10 in.) long branches of fragrant, reddish pink flowers that attract butterflies and bees and will bloom into fall if deadheaded. It grows 6 to 8 ft. tall and wide. The shrub can be rejuvenated by cutting it back to 1 ft. from the ground. U.S. Plant Patent applied for.","Problems

 Galanthus elwesii, commonly called giant snowdrop, has larger flowers, leaves and size than the similar common snowdrop (G. nivalis). Snowdrops bloom in February-March in the St. Louis area, often poking their flower heads up through snow cover if present. The common name refers to the supposed resemblance of the flowers to drops of snow. Each bulb produces two-three narrow (to 1 1/4” wide), linear, basal leaves (to 4” long at flowering) and a leafless flower scape (to 6-10” tall) which is topped with a single, nodding, white, waxy, bell-shaped flower (to 2” long). Each flower has green markings at the base and apex. Leaves will elongate after bloom.Genus name comes from the Greek words gala meaning milk and anthos meaning flower in reference to the color of the flowers.Specific epithet honors Henry John Elwes (1846-1922), English entomologist, botanist and naturalist who reportedly introduced the plant into cultivation.

 Gaultheria procumbens, commonly called wintergreen, is a rhizomatous, creeping, woody, evergreen groundcover of the heath family that is native to woodlands in Eastern North America (Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Minnesota, Tennessee, Virginia and in the mountains to Georgia and Alabama). Erect stems clad with glossy, leathery, elliptic to oblong, dark green leaves (to 2” long) rise up from the rhizomes to 3-6” tall. Plants will spread over time to form an attractive ground cover. Waxy, nodding, bell-shaped, white flowers (3/8” long) bloom from the leaf axils in early summer (June-July). Flowers give way to edible bright red berries (3/8” diameter) that persist through winter. Leaves acquire shades of purple in fall. Leaves and fruit have the aroma and taste of wintergreen. Berries are an excellent winter food for some wildlife such as pheasant, grouse, squirrels and deer. Foliage was once used to make oil of wintergreen which has astringent, stimulant and diuretic properties. Wintergreen has been a popular flavoring for chewing gum, candies and toothpaste. Dried leaves can be used to make an interesting tea (teaberry is a sometimes-used common name for this plant), but this usage is no longer recommended. Leaves were once made into poultices for arthritic pain and sore muscles. Fruits may be eaten raw or added to pastries and salads.Genus name honors Jean-Francois Gaultier (1708-1756) who was the king’s physician in the French colony of Quebec from 1742 until 1756 plus an avid botanist and plant collector.Specific epithet refers to the plant’s low-spreading habit.","Problems

 Gaultheria procumbens, commonly called wintergreen, is a rhizomatous, creeping, woody, evergreen groundcover of the heath family that is native to woodlands in Eastern North America (Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Minnesota, Tennessee, Virginia and in the mountains to Georgia and Alabama). Erect stems clad with glossy, leathery, elliptic to oblong, dark green leaves (to 2” long) rise up from the rhizomes to 3-6” tall. Plants will spread over time to form an attractive ground cover. Waxy, nodding, bell-shaped, white flowers (3/8” long) bloom from the leaf axils in early summer (June-July). Flowers give way to edible bright red berries (3/8” diameter) that persist through winter. Leaves acquire shades of purple in fall. Leaves and fruit have the aroma and taste of wintergreen. Berries are an excellent winter food for some wildlife such as pheasant, grouse, squirrels and deer. Foliage was once used to make oil of wintergreen which has astringent, stimulant and diuretic properties. Wintergreen has been a popular flavoring for chewing gum, candies and toothpaste. Dried leaves can be used to make an interesting tea (teaberry is a sometimes-used common name for this plant), but this usage is no longer recommended. Leaves were once made into poultices for arthritic pain and sore muscles. Fruits may be eaten raw or added to pastries and salads.Genus name honors Jean-Francois Gaultier (1708-1756) who was the king’s physician in the French colony of Quebec from 1742 until 1756 plus an avid botanist and plant collector.Specific epithet refers to the plant’s low-spreading habit.","Problems

 Gazania rigens ia native to South Africa. It is commonly called gazania or treasure flower and is a popular African daisy that is similar in appearance to the genus Arctotis. G. rigens is a parent in many of the gazanias sold in commerce today. It is a tender perennial that features decumbent stems that spread along the ground. Narrow but variably-shaped, dandelion-like leaves (narrow spoon-shaped to lobed) are silvery green. Flowering stems typically rise 6-10” tall topped by solitary, daisy-like ray flowers (to 3-4” wide) with contrasting center disks. Ray flowers of this species are orange with black eyes at the bases and with orange-brown disks. Hybrid cultivars (often listed as cultivars of this species) come in a great variety of additional colors including shades of yellow, orange, bronze or white often with contrasting color at the bases forming a ring around the center disk. Can bloom summer to fall, often to first frost.

If attempted in the St. Louis area, it should be sited in a protected location insulated from winter winds.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Gelsemium sempervirens, commonly called false jasmine or false jessamine, is an evergreen twining vine that is native from Virginia to Florida west to Texas and Central America. It is typically found in open woods, thickets and along roads. Bright, fragrant, funnel-shaped, yellow flowers (to 1.5” long) appear either solitary or in clusters (cymes) in late winter to early spring (February – April depending on location). Flowers often serve as a demonstrative signal that winter is coming to an end. As a vine, false jasmine grows on wiry reddish-brown stems to 20’ long. As a bushy ground cover, it grows to 3’ tall and will sprawl somewhat indefinitely by runners. Shiny, lanceolate, light green leaves (to 1-3” long) are evergreen, but may develop yellow to purple hues in winter. Plants are semi-evergreen toward the northern limits of their growing range. Flowers and foliage are poisonous if ingested. The name of this vine is varyingly spelled as jasmine or jessamine. Carolina jessamine was named the official flower of South Carolina in 1924.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of gelsomino the Italian name for jasmine.Specific epithet means ever green.","Problems

 Geum triflorum is a North American native prairie plant. Perhaps its most distinguishing feature is not the reddish pink to purplish, nodding, globular flowers that bloom in late spring, but the fruiting heads which follow. As the flower fades and the seeds begin to form, the styles elongate (to 2"" long) to form upright, feathery gray tails which collectively resemble a plume or feather duster, all of which has given rise to a large number of regional descriptive common names for this plant such as torch flower, long-plumed purple avens, prairie smoke, lion's beard and old man's whiskers. The feathery seed tails act as sails in aiding dispersal of the seeds. A soft, hairy plant growing typically to 16"" tall with fern-like, pinnately divided, green leaves (7-19 leaflets). Spreads by rhizomes and can be naturalized to form an interesting ground cover.

 Ginkgo biloba is a large, deciduous tree that matures to 100' tall and is considered to be a living fossil. It is the only surviving member of a group of ancient plants believed to have inhabited the earth up to 150 million years ago. It features distinctive two-lobed, somewhat leathery, fan-shaped, rich green leaves with diverging (almost parallel) veins. Leaves turn bright yellow in fall. Ginkgo trees are commonly called maidenhair trees in reference to the resemblance of their fan-shaped leaves to maidenhair fern leaflets (pinnae). Ginkgos are dioecious (separate male and female trees). Nurseries typically sell only male trees (fruitless), because female trees produce seeds encased in fleshy, fruit-like coverings which, at maturity in autumn, are messy and emit a noxious, foul odor upon falling to the ground and splitting open.Genus name is a misrendering of the Japanese gin meaning silver and kyo meaning apricot used in Japan in the 17th century.Specific epithet means two-lobed in reference to the leaves.","Problems

 Best in loose, fertile, moist but well-drained soils in full sun. Sow seeds in spring after danger of frost has passed. Harvest beans when young (before pods turn yellow) if growing as a vegetable. Otherwise, harvest pods after they turn yellow. Soybean crops are often grown in rotation with corn as a method of fixing nitrogen in the soil (plow plants under). Glyphosate resistant varieties are available.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Glycine max, commonly called soybean, is an erect, bushy, hairy, annual legume that typically grows from 2-6’ tall. It features white to purple-pink flowers and trifoliate leaves. Flowers are small (to 1/4”) and ornamentally insignificant, somewhat resembling those of peas. Flowers bloom from mid to late summer. Fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of 3-5. Each pod contains 2-4 seeds. Soybeans today are a major global food crop (second in volume in the U.S. only to corn). They are grown mostly for their protein- and oil-rich seeds, but also for forage, cover and green manure. Additional non-food uses such as biodiesel fuel are becoming increasingly significant. Genus name comes from Greek glykys meaning sweet. This species is native to eastern Asia where it was first cultivated in China around 3000 B.C.Genus name comes from the Greek word glykys meaning sweet in allusion to the sweetness of the roots and leaves of some species.","Problems

 Hamamelis virginiana, known as common witch hazel, is a fall-blooming, deciduous shrub or small tree that is native to woodlands, forest margins and stream banks in eastern North America. It typically grows 15-20’ tall with a similar spread in cultivation, but can reach 30’ tall in its native habitat. Stem-hugging clusters of fragrant bright yellow flowers, each with four crinkly, ribbon-shaped petals, appear along the branches from October to December, usually after leaf drop but sometimes at the time of fall color. Fertilized flowers will form fruit over a long period extending through winter and into the following growing season. Fruits are greenish seed capsules that become woody with age and mature to light brown. Each seed capsule splits open in fall of the following year, exploding the 1-2 black seeds within for up to 30 feet. Oval to obovate, medium to dark green leaves (to 6” long) with dentate to wavy margins turn quality shades of yellow in fall. Plants of this species are usually the last native flowering plants to bloom in Missouri each year.Genus name comes from the Greek words hama meaning at same time and melon meaning apple or fruit in reference to the occurrence of both fruit and flowers at the same time on this shrub (particularly in the case of fall flowering members of the genus).Specific epithet means from Virginia.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Will also grow in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers rich loams. Tolerates some drought, but produces best foliage color in evenly moist soils. In the St. Louis area, plants will benefit from a placement that will provide some protection from winter wind and sun and from hot summer temperatures. Plants may be propagated vegetatively or by seed. Birds help disperse seed. Spreading stems will root at the nodes where they touch the soil. Ground covers rarely need pruning except when they invade unintended areas. Ground covers may be trimmed on the edges with a spade or shears.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Hedera helix, commonly known as English ivy, is a vigorous, aggressive, fast-growing, woody evergreen perennial that is primarily grown as a climbing vine or trailing ground cover.  As a climbing vine, it may over time grow upwards to 50-100' in height. As a ground cover, it typically grows to 6-9"" tall but spreads over time to 50-100'. English ivy grows in two forms or stages: (1) juvenile stage is the climbing/spreading stage (most often seen) in which plants produces thick, 3-5 lobed, dark green leaves (to 4” long ) on non-flowering stems with adventitious roots, and (2) adult stage is the shrubby non-climbing stage in which lobeless, elliptic-ovate, dark green leaves appear on rootless stems that do not spread or climb, but do produce round, umbrella-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in early fall followed by blue-black berries. Native to Europe, English ivy was brought to the U. S. by settlers in colonial days. It has been and continues to be widely sold in the U. S. as an ornamental plant. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in a large number of eastern, midwestern and pacific coast states. In some climates such as in the Pacific Northwest, it is considered by some to be an invasive invader of woodland and open areas where it often aggressively displaces native vegetation by densely smothering large areas of ground with its trailing densely-leaved stems or by climbing into tree canopies via clinging aerial rootlets.Genus name is the Latin name for ivy.Specific epithet from Greek means spiral or twisted.","Problems
 Aphids, mealybugs, caterpillars, loopers and scale may appear. Watch for leaf spots, canker, bacterial leaf spot, stem rot and powdery mildew. Mites can be significant problem. Climbing vines around homes easily crawl into unintended areas, curl around gutters and damage painted surfaces, loose mortar or aluminum siding if growth is not closely monitored.

 Easily grown in dry to medium, sandy to gravelly, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Remove spent flowers to encourage additional bloom. Easily self-seeds in the landscape.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Helenium amarum, commonly known as bitterweed or sneezeweed, is an upright, aromatic, bushy annual of the composite family that typically grows to 12” tall, but less frequently rises to as much as 24”, on upright, striate stems which are many-branched above. Stems are clad with alternate, wide-spreading and ascending, linear to linear-filiform, thread-like leaves (to 3” long but less than 1/8” wide) with resinous glands. Daisy-like flowers (to 3” diameter) bloom from mid/late summer into fall (August-October), with earlier bloom typically occurring in warm winter climates. Each flower features 5-10 wedge-shaped, golden yellow rays, each ray having three lobes at the tip. Rays droop downward from a spherical yellow (occasionally brown) center disk containing numerous tiny disk florets.  
 

 This genus is primarily found growing in sandy soils in the southeastern to southcentral U.S. from Virginia to Florida west to Missouri, Kansas and Texas. However, it has spread over time and naturalized in many of the eastern, central and Great Plains states plus California. It is currently found in a variety of habitats primarily including disturbed areas, upland prairies, plains, rocky glades, woodland margins, gravelly areas along railroad tracks, roadsides, pastures and sandy/gravelly ground.Genus name comes from the Greek name helenion which is the name of a Greek plant which honors Helen of Troy. It is unclear as to the relevance of Helen of Troy to the within genus of plants which are exclusively native to North and South America.Specific epithet from Latin means bitter.Common name of bitterweed is in reference to this plant containing a toxic substance which causes milk to taste bitter when cows graze on the foliage.  
 

 Common name of sneezeweed is reportedly in reference to a former snuff-like use of the dried and powdered flowers of this plant by members of some native American Indian tribes for treatment of blocked sinuses.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Tolerates full sun in cool summer climates. Elsewhere it is best in part shade (some morning sun). Plants are tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions.  Plants perform best in rich, moist, organic soils, with a preference for consistent moisture during the growing season, but plants have tolerance for some dry shade once established. Water is best applied directly to the soil beneath the leaves. Divide plants as needed in spring or autumn. Division is usually easiest in early spring before the leaves unfurl.  Hosta ventricosa is one of the few hostas that will come true from seed. Seeds are produced without fertilization by pseudogamous apomixis which is a form of vegetative reproduction known as agamospermy.  Species plants cannot be used in hybridization as seed parents because the seedlings are simply vegetative clones of the mother plant. Species plants can serve as pollen parents however.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Hosta ventricosa is a large, naturally occurring tetraploid hosta that is native to China and North Korea. It grows in a rounded mound to 22"" tall spreading to 36"" wide. Thin, smooth, shiny, cordate, broad-ovate, dark green leaves (9"" by 8"") have widely spaced veins, undulate margins and mucronate tips. Leaves develop strong ribbing as they mature. Bell-shaped, purple to violet flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn on upright, leafy, burgundy-spotted, pale green scapes (32-38""). Stearn.Genus name honors Austrian botanist Nicholas Thomas Host (1761-1834) and was first established in 1812. The genus was subsequently renamed in 1817 as Funkia in honor of botanist Heinrich Christian Funk under the belief at that time that Hosta was an invalid name. Hosta was finally reinstated as the genus name in 1905 by the International Botanical Congress.Specific epithet means having a swelling on one side.Funkia remains a popular common name today in some areas. An additional common name for plants in this genus is plantain lily (foliage is somewhat plantain-like and flowers are somewhat lily-like in some species).","Problems
 Slugs and snails are attracted to the foliage, chewing jagged holes in the leaves, and if left unchecked, can cause serious damage over a fairly short period of time. Leaf spots and crown rot are less frequent problems. Otherwise, hostas are virtually pest-free and are considered ideal low-maintenance garden perennials. Leaves, particularly of exposed plants, can be severely damaged by hail storms.  Leaves of Hosta ventricosa are thin and may scorch along the edges in the hot summers of the deep South even when grown in full shade.","Garden Uses
 Hostas are a mainstay of shade gardens. This large mounded hosta makes an interesting garden specimen. It is also effective in groups or massed. It can be mixed with other perennials in shady borders, shade gardens or woodland gardens.  Edging.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

 Easily grown in humusy, consistently moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Variegated cultivars develop best foliage color in full sun. Plants spread invasively by rhizomes and may need to be restrained by soil barriers or planted in areas where fixed structures such as sidewalks or buildings will restrict spread. In water gardens, grow in containers as marginal aquatic plants. Plants tolerate up to 2” of standing water over the crowns. In natural ponds, plants are also often grown in containers sunk into the mud to maintain control and to avoid unwanted invasive spread. Grow as a ground cover in moist, boggy areas.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Houttuynia cordata is a rhizomatous perennial that typically grows 9-15” tall and spreads indefinitely and often vigorously by rhizomes.

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, rich soils, but has some tolerance for drought. This vine is dioecious (separate male and female plants), so some male plants are needed (if seed is desired) in order for the female plants to produce seed. Plants die to the ground each winter, but perennial roots survive to send up new growth each spring. Stems may be pruned to the ground in autumn after a hard frost.  Propagate by cuttings of runners emanating from the crown.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Humulus lupulus, commonly known as common hop, is a dioecious, rhizomatous, twining perennial vine that is grown commercially for harvest of female fruits which are used by breweries to preserve and flavor beer. It is also an easy-to-grow ornamental plant that can be grown on a variety of support structures. This vine is native to Europe, southwestern Asia and North America. Hops grown commercially in the U.S. are the European variety which has now escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas. Common hop grows rapidly each year to 15-20' long on rough stems clad with lobed leaves. Yellow-green male flowers bloom in catkins. Female flowers and subsequent seeds are born in cone-like structures (strobiles) which mature in late summer to early fall. Strobiles are typically collected in September-October with the seeds dried for use in the manufacture of beer. Flowers emit a pine-like fragrance and are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from a Medieval name of the hop plant that has apparently been Latinized.Specific epithet literally means small wolf but his plant was was once called willow-wolf as it would be found climbing over willow trees.","Problems

 Tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In St. Louis, grow as an annual or dig tubers in fall. Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Best leaf color usually occurs in full sun. Consistently moist soils are best. This is a tuberous plant that is not grown from seed. Purchase plants in spring and set out after last frost date. In fall before first frost, dig, dry and store tubers in a dry medium (vermiculite or peat) in a cool dry corner of the basement. When tubers sprout in spring, cut them into sections (at least one eye per section) and plant the sections outdoors after last frost date. Tubers can also be sunk ½ way into a large-mouthed glass jar of water in early spring to generate sprouts that can be removed and planted. Container plants and or rooted cuttings taken in late summer may be overwintered indoors in bright sunny locations.

 Ipomoea batatas, commonly called sweet potato or sweet potato vine, is native to tropical America. It is a tuberous rooted tender perennial that has been cultivated for its orange-fleshed edible tubers for over 2000 years. It was reportedly brought back to Europe from the New World by Columbus. Today, the sweet potato is a popular root vegetable that is grown in vegetable gardens and as a commercial food crop throughout the world. Although species plants and varieties grown as food crops have somewhat attractive green foliage, it is the more recently introduced purple-, chartreuse- and variegated-leaved cultivars that have transformed this vegetable into a popular ornamental foliage plant. If grown as a ground cover, plant stems typically mound to 9” tall but spread by trailing stems to 8-10’ wide, rooting in the ground at the nodes as they go. Leaves of the ornamental varieties are heart-shaped to palmately-lobed (to 6” long) and come in bright green, dark purple, chartreuse and variegated (green with pink or white) colors. Although species plants produce pale pink to violet trumpet-shaped flowers, ornamental varieties usually do not flower. Tubers of the ornamental varieties are edible, but are not as tasty as those of the varieties specifically bred for food production.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants. On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.","Problems

 Iris germanica, commonly called common flag or German iris, is the presumed father of most modern bearded iris cultivars. Origin is uncertain, but species plants are probably native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean area. This iris has become established over time throughout the world, with naturalization having occurred in many parts of Europe and the U.S. It is difficult to specifically describe German iris as a species because it appears in so many different forms. Thousands of bearded iris cultivars have been introduced into commerce over time. Iris germanica as a species is simply not sold in commerce today. In general terms, plants grow 2-3' tall with sword-shaped linear leaves and large usually fragrant blooms on stalks that branch below their mid points. Each flower has six perianth segments: three falls are purple with brown veins, white bases and yellow beards and three standards are lilac. Each stalk (to 3' tall) typically produces up to 6 flowers in spring. Sword shaped leaves are mostly basal, in two ranks, and about 2' long. German iris has no bulb. It spreads by creeping rhizomes which form large clumps over time. Thousands of bearded iris cultivars in a rainbow of different colors have been introduced over the years, with cultivars now classified into several different types: miniature dwarf (8"" or less), standard dwarf (8-15 inches), intermediate (16-27 inches), miniature tall (16-25 inches but with small flowers), border (16-27 inches) and tall (28-38 inches).Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means of Germany.","Problems
 The major insect pest of German iris is iris borer. Major disease problems are bacterial soft rot, crown rot fungus, and fungal leaf spot. Watch for mottling of leaves and flowers which may indicate the presence of mosaic virus. Good sanitation practices are the most important component of any disease/insect control program: promptly remove and destroy diseased foliage/rhizomes, promptly remove and destroy borer-infected foliage/rhizomes and perform an annual clean-up of all debris and foliage from beds in fall after frost. The most frequent causes of failure to flower or sparse flowering are (1) rhizomes are planted too deep, (2) plants are located in too much shade, (3) plants were given too much fertilizer or (4) plants have become overcrowded and need division.","Garden Uses

 Iris reticulata, commonly called reticulated iris, is a bulbous perennial iris that is native to Turkey, the Caucasus, Northern Iraq and Iran. It is a low-growing purple-flowered reticulate or netted iris that blooms in March to early April in the St. Louis area, at about the same time as snowdrops (Galanthus), glory-of-the-snow (Chionodoxa) and the early crocuses. Striking purple 2.5” diameter flowers with gold crests and white streaks on the falls appear on naked stems (scapes) typically growing to 6-8"" tall. Flowers have a sweet fragrance. Narrow, linear, 4-sided, grass-like leaves (usually 2-4 per plant) typically rise to the same level as the flower at the time of bloom, but elongate to 12-15” after bloom before eventually disappearing by late spring as the plant goes dormant.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet is in reference to the netted or reticulate pattern on the dry bulbs.","Problems

 Easily grown in moist, fertile, humusy, organically rich, neutral to slightly acidic, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Siberian iris is an adaptable plant which tolerates a wide range of soils, including boggy ones, but will generally perform well in average garden soils. Avoid soils that are too wet or too dry. In too much shade, plants tend to produce fewer flowers and foliage tends to flop. Best with consistent moisture from the onset of spring growth until several weeks after the flowers fade. Continue irrigation after bloom, however, to keep foliage clumps attractive. Rhizomes should be planted 1-2” below the soil surface and 1-2’ apart. In cold winter regions, plant the rhizomes in early spring or late summer. In mild winter regions, plant the rhizomes in fall. Divide plants as needed when overcrowding occurs and decreased flowering is evident. Remove flowering stems promptly after bloom unless the seed pods are considered to be an attractive addition to the garden.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Plants in the Siberian iris group are chiefly of hybrid origin, primarily being derived from two blue-flowered Asian species, namely, I. sibirica (central Europe to northeastern Turkey and southeastern Russia) and I. sanguinea (Russia, Korea and Japan). Arching, narrow, grass-like, linear, blue-green leaves form a vase-shaped foliage clump to 2’ tall. Flowering stems rise above the foliage to 3’ tall in May-June, each stem bearing 2-5 flowers in colors which primarily include blue, lavender, purple and white, but sometimes yellow, pink and wine. Each flower features upright standards and flaring to drooping falls. In comparison to bearded varieties, Siberian irises have smaller beardless flowers, narrower grass-like leaves and an absence of thick fleshy rhizomes.

 Iris veriscolor, commonly called northern blue flag, is a clump-forming iris that is native to marshes, swamps, wet meadows, ditches and shorelines from Manitoba to Nova Scotia south to Virginia, Ohio, Illinois and Minnesota. It is a marginal aquatic plant that forms a clump of narrow, arching-to-erect, sword-shaped, blue-green leaves (to 24” long and 1” wide). Flowering stalks rise from the clump to 30” tall in late spring, with each stalk producing 3-5 bluish-purple flowers (to 4"" wide) with bold purple veining. Falls (sepals) have a central yellow blotch surrounded by a white zone. Clumps spread slowly by tough, creeping rhizomes.  Northern blue flag thrives in wetland habitats frequented by rushes and sedges (the ""flag"" part of the common name comes from the middle English word flagge meaning rush or reed). Rhizome is poisonous.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means having various colors.","Problems

 Bambusa ventricosa, commonly called Buddha bamboo or Buddha Belly, is a tropical clumping bamboo of the grass family. It is native to southern China where it typically matures on thick-walled stems (to 2 1/4” diameter) to 55’ tall. In the U.S., it is grown in the ground in parts of southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii where it typically matures to a somewhat shorter 30-45’ tall. This bamboo has cylindrical jointed stems and usually persistent leaf sheaths. Linear lanceolate leaves grow to 7” long.
 

 This species is, however, popularly grown in containers and tubs in subtropical regions around the world where it assumes a much more compact form to only 5-8’ tall with stem diameters to 1 5/8”, featuring not only shorter stems, shorter internodes and smaller leaves, but also showcasing internodes that are distinctively swollen or bulging in an ornamentally attractive fashion, hence the common name of Buddha belly. The swollen internodes are basically caused by stress to the plant (e.g., limited available root space of a container, poor soil, inadequate water).Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Malayan vernacular name.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word ventricosus/ meaning swollen on one side (pot-bellied).","Problems

 Juglans cinerea, commonly called butternut, is not commonly grown as an ornamental but it is a valued native American tree that is unfortunately becoming increasingly rare in the wild now because of a canker disease (see below). Butternut is similar in appearance to black walnut (see Juglans nigra), except it is generally smaller, its bark is less fissured, it has fewer leaflets per leaf and its nuts are more oval than round. It is native to moist bottomlands, lowland forests and some drier limestone soils in eastern and midwestern North America, from New Brunswick to Minnesota, south to Georgia and Arkansas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rich woods and along streams in all but the far western parts of the state. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with an open broadly-rounded crown. Features odd-pinnate compound leaves (to 20” long), each with 11-17 oblong to lanceolate leaflets. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow in fall. Yellowish green monoecious flowers appear in late spring (May-June), the male flowers in drooping catkins and the female flowers in short terminal spikes. Female flowers give way to clusters of edible oval nuts encased in hairy indehiscent husks. Nuts mature in fall. Nut shells can be hard to crack and the kernels are often small. But the kernels are sweet, oily and tasty, having a buttery flavor as per the common name. Native Americans used the nuts for food and boiled the tree sap for syrup. Butternut wood, though softer than black walnut, was once valued for a variety of uses including paneling, cabinets and furniture. Overharvesting of trees for commercial use plus losses from the canker disease have reduced native tree populations to the point where the butternut is now endangered in most parts of its range. This species is sometimes commonly called white walnut because of the light color of the wood.Genus name comes from the Latin names jovis meaning of Jupiter and glans meaning an acorn.Specific epithet refers to the ash gray color of the bark.","Problems
 Susceptible to butternut dieback or butternut canker (Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum), which is a usually fatal fungal disease that is devastating butternut trees in the wild. Onset of the disease is often first seen as dying stems and branches in the upper crown. This canker has no cure. Insect pests include butternut curculio, borers, lace bugs, caterpillars and bark beetles. As with black walnut, butternut roots produce chemicals called juglones which are very toxic to certain other plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, peonies and solanaceous crops (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes). Most of the toxicity is limited to within the drip line of the tree, but the area of toxicity typically increases outward as the tree matures.","Garden Uses

 Juglans nigra, commonly called black walnut, is a large deciduous tree typically growing 75-100’ (less frequently to 125’) tall with and an oval to rounded crown. Mature trees characteristically have long trunks, often with an absence of lower branching. Fissured, sharply ridged, dark gray-black bark forms diamond patterns. Black walnut is native from Massachusetts through southern Ontario to South Dakota south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rich woods, in valleys along streams and in open upland woods throughout the state (Steyermark). Features odd-pinnate compound leaves (to 24” long), each with 13-23 oblong to lanceolate leaflets. The terminal leaflet is often missing. Leaves are late to emerge in spring and early to drop in fall. Leaves are strongly aromatic when crushed. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow. Yellow green monoecious flowers appear in late spring (May-June), the male flowers in drooping hairy catkins and the female flowers in short terminal spikes. Female flowers give way to edible nuts, each being encased in a yellow-green husk. Nuts mature in autumn, falling to the ground where the husks blacken as they rot away. Kernels are edible but hard to extract. Black walnuts are harvested for commercial sale. The wood from this tree is highly valued for a number of commercial uses including cabinets, furniture, gunstocks and fine veneers. It is perhaps the best furniture wood available from any native American tree. Overharvesting of trees for the wood has greatly reduced the native populations in the wild. Native Americans used the nuts for food and boiled the tree sap for syrup. They also reportedly threw the husks into ponds to poison fish, making them easier to catch.Genus name comes from the Latin names jovis meaning of Jupiter and glans meaning an acorn.Specific epithet means black, in reference to the dark bark and nuts.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Potential diseases include anthracnose, bacterial blight, root rot, canker, leaf spot and shoot dieback.

 Easily grown in moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Performs well in standing water to 4” deep, but will also grow well in garden soils as long as the soils are in fact kept consistently moist. Plants will spread in the landscape by rhizomes and by self-seeding. Rhizomatous spread may be controlled, if desired, by growing this plant in large containers sunk in the ground. Foliage remains evergreen in warm winter climates or when grown indoors as a houseplant. In St. Louis, outdoor clumps die to the ground in winter. Old foliage should be cut back in early spring. Propagate by seed or division.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Juncus effuses, commonly known as soft rush, common rush, bog rush or mat rush, is a grasslike-like, rhizomatous, wetland perennial that features smooth, upright, cylindrical, unjointed, spire-like green stems (leaves are absent) which grow in spreading basal clumps to 20-40” tall. It is one of the true rushes. It has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, being found in many places around the world, but primarily in cool-temperate regions, particularly ones having wet soils. It is often found growing in ditches, bogs, swamps, marshes, wet pastures, and along the margins of lakes and rivers. It is infrequently found growing in tropical areas. Stems are usually solid, with the leaves typically reduced to bladeless basal sheathes. Insignificant, minute, yellowish-green to pale brown flowers bloom in one-sided clusters (many-flowered cymes) located on stem sides slightly below the stem tips. Flowers emerge in summer (July to September). Fruit is an obovoid capsule. Clumps provide vertical accent to moist garden areas. Although the stems appear from a distance as coarse and stiff, they are soft to the touch. Soft rush is considered to be a somewhat invasive weed in a number of locations. Foliage turns yellow in fall before browning up for winter.Genus name means rush.Specific epithet means loose-spreading in probable reference to plant habit.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Rust, leaf spot and stem rots may occur.","Garden Uses
 Except for certain horticultural varieties, straight species plants are typically not grown as garden plants.

 Kalmia latifolia, commonly called mountain laurel, is a gnarled, multi-stemmed, broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that is native to Eastern North America (New England south to the southern Indiana, Louisiana and the Florida panhandle) where it is found in a variety of habitats including open rocky or sandy woods, cool meadows, balds, mountain slopes and woodland margins. It is noted for its excellent spring flowers and quality year round foliage. It typically grows as a dense rounded shrub to 5-15’ tall, opening up and developing gnarly branches with age. Notwithstanding its usual shrub habit, mountain laurel will rarely grow as a small tree (particularly on slopes in the Appalachian Mountains) to as much as 30’ tall. Flowers appear in terminal clusters (corymbs to 6” across), typically covering the shrub in late May-June for several weeks with an often exceptional bloom. Each flower (to 1” across) is cup shaped with five sides and ranges in color from rose to white with purple markings inside. If not deadheaded, flowers give way to non-showy brown fruits (3/16” dehiscent capsules) that persist into winter.  Elliptic, alternate, leathery, glossy evergreen leaves (to 5” long) are dark green above and yellow green beneath and reminiscent to the leaves of rhododendrons.

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Best in medium moisture soils in part shade. Once established, it tolerates drought. Spreads by stem fragments, rooting at the nodes, creeping stems, and seed. It can be somewhat invasive in optimum growing conditions. Propagate by division or stem cuttings. Will self-seed in the garden, but cultivars may not come true to form. If plants become leggy, shear back to 4-6” or to new fresh basal leaves in order to shape plants and to promote new foliage growth.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lamium galeobdolon, commonly known as yellow archangel or golden dead-nettle, is a stoloniferous spreading perennial of the mint family (opposite leaves and square stems) that typically grows to 9-15” tall but spreads by stem fragments, rooting at the nodes, and spreads to 18” wide or more. It is native to shaded woodlands, copses and thickets throughout much of Europe and western Asia. It has been introduced into parts of the U.S., often escaping into the wild where it persists and spreads as a weed, typically outcompeting native plants. It has been declared a non-regulated Class B noxious weed in parts of the State of Washington where it cannot now be legally sold.  
 

 Yellow archangel forms a loose mat of foliage which spreads indefinitely. Small, tubular, two-lipped, asymmetrical, yellow flowers (each to 3/4” long) bloom in 2-10 flowered verticillasters on short axillary stalks in late spring (April-June). Each flower has some reddish-brown markings on the lower lip. This plant trails along the ground by creeping runners (stolons) as a ground cover, but will climb in an almost vine-like manner over low growing vegetation and tree stumps, typically rooting in the ground at the nodes when they come in contact with the soil. Sprawling to erect stems are clad with toothed, ovate to rounded, cordate-based, medium to dark green leaves (1-3” long) with pointed tips. Leaves are aromatic when crushed. Leaves are sometimes variegated with silver-gray markings. Leaves are semi-evergreen in warm winter climates, but deciduous in the colder parts of the growing range.
 

 Lamiastrum galeobdolon is a former name currently considered to be a synonym.Genus name comes from the Greek laimos or lamos meaning throat in reference to the throat-like appearance of the corolla.Specific epithet has several possible origins. It may come from the Latin words galeo meaning to cover with a helmet and dolon meaning a fly’s sting. On the other hand, it may come from the Greek words gale meaning weasel and bdolos meaning fetid smell (weasel-snout is a sometimes used common name for this plant).Archangel is the primary common name for this plant in reference to the wing-like shape of the leaves.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where plants will thrive outdoors as sprawling, low-growing shrubs featuring continuous bloom throughout the year. Plants are easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants tolerate part shade, but best flowering is in full sun. Plants thrive in lean, sandy, slightly-dry soils. In St. Louis, plants must be grown as annuals or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool locations. Another option is to take cuttings in late summer from favorite plants for overwintering. Many gardeners elect to purchase new plants each spring in 6-packs rather than trying to overwinter plants or cuttings from the previous year. Container plants are less tolerant of dry soils than plants grown in the ground, and accordingly should be watered regularly and never allowed to dry out.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lantana montevidensis, commonly called trailing lantana or weeping lantana, is native to tropical areas of South America. In frost free areas, it grows as a low, trailing, woody shrub to only 12-20"" tall, but spreads by vine-like stems to 5' wide or more. It is typically grown as a dense ground cover. It features hairy, opposite, coarsely-toothed, ovate, dark green leaves (unpleasant aroma when bruised). Leaves can be a skin irritant. Clusters (to 1 1/2"" across) of tiny lilac to purplish-pink flowers with yellow throats bloom profusely throughout the year in frost free areas. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. In St. Louis, trailing lantana is grown as an annual, with flowers blooming from spring to fall frost. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. Trailing lantana has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the southern U.S. including Florida, the Gulf Coast and southern California. It can spread invasively in frost free areas, but appears to be somewhat less invasive than its close relative Lantana camara. Genus name comes from the Latin name for viburnum. This species was reportedly discovered in Montevideo, Uruguay, hence the specific epithet.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Viburnum transferred to this genus.Specific epithet means of Montevideo, Uruguay.","Problems

 Cool weather annual that is best grown in rich, humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Compost may be incorporated into the growing area prior to planting. Best performance occurs in cool soils (soil mulch helps) in cool summer climates with good air circulation. Sweet pea can be a challenge to grow well in hot and humid summers where, as temperatures rise, plants will decline rapidly to the point where removal from the garden becomes necessary. Provide even moisture and regular fertilizer throughout the growing season. Avoid overhead watering to the extent possible. In St. Louis, start seed indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date to maximize bloom time. In warm winter areas, seed may be sown in fall or late fall for winter and spring bloom. Avoid planting sweet peas in the same location in consecutive years. Plants may be grown in bushy mounds or as climbers.

 Lathyrus odoratus, commonly called sweet pea, is a bushy or climbing annual that features highly fragrant flowers (odoratus meaning fragrant) on winged stems clad with medium to dark green leaflets in pairs. Stems end in tendrils which enable plants to climb. As a vine, it will climb to 6-8’ in a single season. Without support, it grows in a bushy mound to 2.5’ tall. Fragrant keeled flowers bloom in clusters. In St. Louis, flowers will bloom well from spring to early summer before succumbing to hot temperatures. Further north in cool weather summers, bloom will continue throughout summer to fall. Species plants feature purple flowers, but numerous cultivars now provide a large variety of additional flower colors (pink, red, blue, lavender, purple, white and bicolor).

In St. Louis, this shrubby tropical plant may be grown as an annual bedding plant from seed sown each spring or as a tender perennial in containers that are overwintered indoors. If grown as an annual, seed should be started indoors in winter or sown in the garden before the last frost date for flowering in fall. If grown as a tender perennial, seed can be sown in containers which are moved outside after last frost date. If flowering occurs on container plants in fall, plants may be overwintered in bright sunny locations with flowering continuing into winter. If container plants do not flower in fall, then they should be overwintered indoors in a cool location with bright light and returned outdoors after last frost date, with flowering usually occurring in late spring to summer. Cuttings may be taken in spring from overwintered plants or from garden plants in summer for overwintering.

 Liquidambar styraciflua, commonly called sweet gum, is a low-maintenance deciduous shade tree that is native from Connecticut to Florida and Missouri further south to Texas, Mexico and Central America. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist low woods and along streams only in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark). It typically grows to 60-80’ (less frequently to 120’) tall with a straight trunk. Habit is pyramidal in youth, but it gradually develops an oval-rounded crown as it matures. Glossy, long-stalked, deep green leaves (4-7” across) have toothed margins. Each leaf has 5-7 pointed, star-shaped lobes. Leaves are fragrant when bruised. Fall color at its best is a brilliant mixture of yellows, oranges, purples and reds. Branchlets may have distinctive corky ridges. Non-showy, monoecious, yellow-green flowers appear in spherical clusters in April-May. Female flowers give way to the infamous gum balls which are hard, spherical, bristly fruiting clusters to 1.5” diameter. Gum balls mature to dark brown and usually remain on the tree through the winter, but can create clean-up problems during the general period of December through April as the clusters fall to the ground. In pedestrian areas, fruiting clusters must be cleaned up because they not only create unsightly litter, but also create human safety problems (e.g., turning an ankle by inadvertently stepping on a cluster). Tree wood has been widely used for a number of applications including flooring, furniture and home interiors. The gum obtained from genus plants has been used in the past for a variety of purposes, including chewing gum, incense, perfumes, folk medicines and flavorings.Genus name comes from the Latin words liquidus meaning liquid and","Problems

 Best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained loams in full sun. Tolerates part shade.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Liriodendron tulipifera, commonly called tulip tree or yellow poplar, is a large, stately, deciduous tree of eastern North America that typically grows 60-90' (less frequently to 150’) tall with a pyramidal to broad conical habit. Although widely planted throughout the state of Missouri, it is indigenous to rich woods in only a few counties in the far southeastern corner of the state. Trunks of mature trees may reach 4-6’ in diameter, usually rising column-like with an absence of lower branching. It is named and noted for its cup-shaped, tulip-like flowers that bloom in spring. Flowers are yellow with an orange band at the base of each petal. Although the flowers are 2” in length, they can go unnoticed on large trees because the flowers appear after the leaves are fully developed. Sometimes the flowers are first noticed when the attractive petals begin to fall below the tree. Flowers are followed by dry, scaly, oblong, cone-shaped brown fruits, each bearing numerous winged seeds. Four-lobed bright green leaves (to 8” across) turn golden yellow in fall. Wood is used inter alia for furniture, plywood, boatbuilding, paper pulp and general lumber. Native Americans made dugout canoes from tuliptree trunks. This is the state tree of Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana.Genus name comes from the Greek words leirion meaning a lily and dendron meaning a tree for the flowers.Specific epithet means tulip bearing for the form of the flowers.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids and scale. Potential diseases include verticillium wilt, mold, mildew and canker. Large aphid infestations result in honeydew secretions on the leaves that provide the growing medium for sooty mold.

 Grow in average, medium moisture soils in full sun to part shade. Perennial ryegrass is best in cool climates, and is not generally recommended for Missouri lawns. It is, however, recommended for use in mixtures as a starter that will provide early cover until the slower growing grasses in the mixture kick in.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lolium perenne, called perennial ryegrass, is a cool season, non-creeping, bunch-type grass which is primarily used as a turfgrass. Features shallow roots and glossy green leaf blades (1/8"" wide) which can technically grow to 2' tall. It somewhat resembles Kentucky bluegrass in appearance. Main virtues are rapid germination time, quick coverage and traffic tolerance (good for athletic fields). Main vices are non-spreading habit and tough flower/seed stems which tend to lie down and avoid the mower. If planted alone, it usually develops into a somewhat tufted turf. When bare spots occur, they must be reseeded because the grass does not spread. In the South, perennial ryegrass is sometimes used to overseed Bermuda grass lawns so that the lawns will show some green in winter when the Bermuda goes dormant.Genus name is the classical Latin name for a species of rye-grass.Specific epithet means perennial.'Manhattan' is considered to be finer and more uniform than the species.","Problems
 Perennial ryegrass is susceptible to a number of fungal diseases which are particularly troublesome in hot, humid climates, including Fusarium patch, Pythium blight, Rhizoctonia blight, red thread, rust and stripe smut. This cultivar has improved resistance to these diseases over the species.","Garden Uses

 Best grown in organically-rich, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Shrubs will take full sun in the northern parts of the growing area, but appreciate some afternoon shade in hotter southern parts of the growing area. Shredded bark mulch will help soils retain moisture. Consistent moisture is important in the early years of development. Shrubs will show some drought tolerance only after root systems are well-established. Shrubs are winter hardy to USDA Zones 2-6 or 2-7. South of Zone 7, plants often will not receive enough chilling hours in winter to grow well and produce abundant fruit. Shrubs are unisexual (not self fertile). Compatible plants should be planted in pairs or groups in order for pollination and fruit set to occur. Prune if needed immediately after harvest of fruits. Shrubs will not sucker in the landscape.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Lonicera caerulea, commonly known by a variety of common names including blue honeysuckle, honeyberry, sweetberry honeysuckle, and haskap, is a circumpolar, multi-branched, deciduous shrub that is native to moist boreal forest areas, mostly in peaty soils, in northern temperate climates in Asia, Europe and North America.  
 

 This shrub in general is unlike many of its honeysuckle relatives in that it produces an edible, tasty, blueberry-like fruit. It typically grows to 4-6’ tall and as wide. Opposite, elliptic to ovate, glaucous green leaves (each to 2-3” long) have slightly wavy leaf margins. Pale yellowish-white flowers (to 5/8” long) bloom in late spring to early summer (April-June) in pairs along the shoots. Fruits ripen in early summer to deep blue with reddish-purple insides. Fruits are pruinose with an oval-teardrop to almost-globose shape.  
 

 Variability in growing characteristics results in part from the large geographic distribution of this shrub. Some current confusion exists regarding differentiation between varieties/subspecies. Some experts have identified as many as 9 different varieties, but other experts have instead divided the species into 4 different
 subspecies. Cultivars with improved characteristics are available in commerce.Genus name honors Adam Lonitzer (1528-1586), German botanist, the author of an herbal (Kreuterbuch) many times reprinted between 1557 and 1783.Specific epithet means dark blue in reference to fruit color.","Problems
 No known serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew may occur.","Garden Uses

 Magnolia virginiana, commonly called sweet bay magnolia, is native to the southeastern United States north along the Atlantic coast to New York. In the northern part of its cultivated growing range, it typically grows as either a 15-20' tall tree with a spreading, rounded crown or as a shorter, suckering, open, multi-stemmed shrub. In the deep South, it is apt to be more tree-like, sometimes growing to 60' tall. Features cup-shaped, sweetly fragrant (lemony), 9-12 petaled, creamy white, waxy flowers (2-3"" diameter) which appear in mid-spring and sometimes continue sporadically throughout the summer. Oblong-lanceolate shiny green foliage is silvery beneath. Foliage is evergreen to semi-evergreen in the South, but generally deciduous in the St. Louis area. Cone-like fruits with bright red seeds mature in fall and can be showy.

 Mahonia bealei, commonly known as Beale’s barberry or leatherleaf mahonia, is an evergreen shrub with pinnate compound leaves which typically grows in a multi-stemmed clump to 4-10’ tall but occasionally taller. It is native to western China. It is very similar to M. japonica (native to Taiwan). It has been introduced into the southeastern U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized from Maryland and Virginia south to Alabama and Florida. Leathery, pinnate-compound, holly-like leaves (to 12-18"" long) grow in horizontal tiers. Each leaf has 5-8 pairs of narrow, stiff, spiny-toothed, oblong to lance-shaped, dark green leaflets (to 4"" long) with a broad terminal leaflet extending to as much as 8” long. Fragrant yellow flowers in loose, spreading to pendant racemes (each to 3-6” long), bloom in late winter to early spring (February- April). Flowers are followed by ornamentally attractive, waxy green fruits which hang in grape-like clusters and mature to blue-black in late spring to early summer. Fruits are attractive to birds.

 Garcinia mangostana, commonly called mangosteen, is an erect, slow-growing, tropical tree with a pyramidal crown that is native to rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia. It produces tangerine-sized fruits called mangosteens which are considered in many circles to be the finest tasting fruits in the world. Unfortunately this tree is very difficult to grow outside of its native habitat because of its specific and uncompromising cultural requirements. At this time, mangosteens are primarily cultivated in Malaysia, Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Attempts to grow mangosteens in Florida, California and Hawaii have been largely unsuccessful. In its native habitat, this tree will grow to 80' tall, but in most other tropical locations it typically matures to 40-50' tall. Large, glossy, leathery, elliptic leaves (to 20"" long) are evergreen. Trees are dioecious (separate male and female trees), but female flowers will produce seedless fruit without pollinization. Four-petaled female flowers are yellow-red with a cluster of center stamens which produce no pollen. Hermaphroditic flowers are yellow-green with red petal margins. Fruits (to 4"" diameter) have thick inedible rinds that mature to reddish purple. Within each rind are 5-8 fleshy, creamy-white, usually one-seeded segments (arils) which are the edible part of the fruit. Fruit is juicy, sweet and mildly tart. Time of fruiting seasons will vary depending upon geographical location and growing conditions.

Prefers temperatures that do not dip below 60 degrees F.  Zero tolerance for frost. In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant. It performs well in a soil-based potting mix and with bright indoor light but no strong direct sun. Too much sun will bleach out the attractive leaf colors. Keep soils consistently moist and fertilize monthly during the growing season, but reduce soil moisture and substantially reduce fertilizer applications from autumn to late winter. Consider placing this plant in a humidified room and/or in standing pot in a tray of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Propagate by cuttings or division.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Maranta leuconeura, commonly called prayer plant, is an evergreen, rhizomatous, low-growing, clump-forming, tropical perennial that is noted for its beautiful foliage. It typically grows to 12-15” tall and as wide, featuring broad-elliptic to oval, predominately green leaves (to 5” long) with striking patterns, lines, blotches and shading. White veins radiate from the midrib to the margins. Leaf undersides are grayish-green to purplish-green. It is native to Brazil. Leaves close upward at night in a manner resembling praying hands, hence the common name of prayer plant. White, two-lipped flowers with purple spots typically bloom on slender spikes in late spring to early summer, but infrequently appear on houseplants. Small flowers are somewhat attractive but ornamentally insignificant.

 Matricaria recutita, commonly called German chamomile or sweet false chamomile, is an annual aromatic Eurasian herb that is commonly grown in herb gardens for harvest of its flowers which are principally used to make chamomile tea which is a mild sedative herbal drink recommended for a large number of applications including calming nerves, relaxing tense muscles, alleviating stress, dispelling insomnia and treating indigestion. This plant has escaped garden plantings and has naturalized in open areas and along roads in various parts of North America. It typically grows to 12-24"" tall and to 12"" wide on stems clad with aromatic but bitter tasting double pinnate leaves (to 3"" long).  Showy daisy-like flowers bloom summer to fall. Each flower features 10-20 petal-like white rays surrounding a showy bright yellow domed center disk of tubular yellow florets. For herbal use, harvest flowers when fully open. Flowers may be used fresh off the plant or dried and stored in airtight containers (freeze if product will not be used soon). German chamomile is used in most commercially marketed packages of chamomile tea rather than Roman chamomile (Chamamaemelum nobile) in large part because the former has a much sweeter and less bitter taste than the latter.Genus name comes from the medieval name possibly from the Latin word matrix meaning womb because of its one-time medical use.Specific epithet means circumcised for the ray petals.","Problems

 Matteuccia struthiopteris, commonly called ostrich fern, is a clump-forming, upright to arching, rhizomatous, deciduous fern which typically grows 2-3' tall in cultivation, but may reach 6' tall in moist, cool climates in the wild. The showy parts of this fern are the finely dissected, medium green, vegetative (sterile) fronds which, as the common name suggests, exhibit the feathery appearance of long ostrich plumes. The vegetative fronds emerge at the narrow base of the clumps in spring as the familiar ""fiddleheads"" from where they unfurl to a maximum length of 4'. These vegetative fronds usually depreciate as the summer proceeds, begin to look rather tattered by early fall and finally lose their leaflets later in the fall as the plant goes dormant for the winter. The sterile fronds form a huge vase-like crown around the much less showy fertile fronds which are erect, spike-like and dark brown. The fertile fronds arise in mid-summer and persist through the winter.Genus name honors Carlo Matteucci (1800-1863), Italian physicist.","Problems

Over the years, a huge number of stock varieties have been developed, mostly hybrids involving M. incana, M. sinuata and M. odorata. Strict species plants are basically no longer available. In general, plants grow to 1-3’ tall on upright stems clad with oblong, hairy, gray-green leaves (to 4” long). Extremely fragrant flowers, both singles and doubles, bloom in dense clusters (terminal racemes) in a large variety of colors including shades of pink, lavender, purple, white, yellow and red. Flowers bloom from late spring into fall (sometimes frost) in cool summer conditions, but bloom time is abbreviated considerably in hot summer climates.

 Meehania cordata, commonly called Meehan’s mint or creeping mint, is a stoloniferous, mat-forming mint that resembles in appearance the common lawn and garden weed known as gill-over-the-ground or ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), but it does not exhibit the very aggressive tendencies of the latter. It is native from western Pennsylvania to North Carolina, Tennessee and Illinois, where it typically occurs in rich woods and wooded slopes. This is a low-growing perennial with trailing square stems and opposite broadly heart shaped green leaves (to 1” long) with crenate margins. Hooded, two-lipped, lavender blue flowers bloom in mid to late spring. Flowers (to 1” long) are somewhat large for the plant, appearing in upright 3-inch spikes on stems rising to 4-6” tall.Genus name honors distinguished American horticulturist and editor Thomas Meehan (d. 1901).Specific epithet means heart-shaped in reference to the leaves.","Problems

 Best grown in rich, light, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Tolerates shady garden areas. Adapts to a wide range of soils except dry ones. Intolerant of drought. Tolerates limited foot traffic.  Starter plants are typically planted 6-10"" apart.  Propagation is usually done by division. Freely self-seeds in optimum growing conditions. Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 6, but may be grown as annuals north of Zone 6 with plants continuing to appear in the garden for several years by self-seeding.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Mentha requienii, commonly called Corsican mint or creeping mint, is a miniature mat-forming plant that typically grows to only 1/2"" to 1"" tall but spreads by thread-like stems which creep along the ground rooting as they go to 12"" wide or more to form a dense flat diminutive ground cover. It is particularly effective as an aromatic filler growing around stepping stones where light foot traffic will release a pleasing mint/sage aroma. Leaves are evergreen in mild winter climates but not in St. Louis. This mint is native to the Islands of Corsica, Sardinia and Montecristo.  Tiny round green leaves (to 1/8"" across) have a strong aroma when bruised. Leaves are the source of the flavoring in creme-de-menthe. Tiny minute lilac flowers bloom from the leaf axils in summer (late June -August). Flowers are so small they are often not seen.Genus name comes from Minthe or Menthe, a water nymph in Greek mythology, who was transformed by Persephone into a mint plant in revenge for Minthe's ongoing affair with Hades (husband of Persephone).Specific epithet honors Esprit Requien (1788-1851), naturalist and student of the flora of southern France and Corsica.","Problems

 Metasequoia glyptostroboides, commonly called dawn redwood, is a deciduous, coniferous tree that grows in a conical shape to 100’ tall. It is related to and closely resembles bald cypress (Taxodium) and redwood (Sequoia). From fossil records, dawn redwood is known to have existed as many as 50,000,000 years ago. However, it was not until 1941 that it was first discovered growing in the wild near the town of Modaoqi, China by Chinese forester, T. Kan. Seeds collected from the original site were made available to the Missouri Botanical Garden in 1947. Seedlings grown therefrom were planted in front of the Lehmann Building at MBG in 1952 where they have now developed into large mature trees (70’+ tall). As the tree matures, the trunk broadens at the base and develops attractive and sometimes elaborate fluting. Bark on mature trees is often deeply fissured. It features linear, feathery, fern-like foliage that is soft to the touch. Foliage emerges light green in spring, matures to deep green in summer and turns red-bronze in fall. Trees are monoecious, producing oval, light brown female cones (3/4” long) and pendant globose male cones (1/2” long). The twigs, needles and cone scales are in opposite pairs.Genus name comes from the Greek words metra meaning with, after, sharing, or changed in nature and Sequoia to which it is related and to which fossil specimens were first referred.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Glyptostrobus.","Problems

 Mimulus ringens, commonly called Allegheny monkey flower or square-stemmed monkey flower, is a rhizomatous, Missouri native, upright perennial which typically occurs in swampy areas, wet meadows, pond/streambanks and low woods throughout the State. Typically grows 1-3' (less frequently to 4') tall on erect, square, sometimes branching stems. Features lilac-purple, snapdragon-like flowers (to 1"" long) with two-lipped, open-mouthed corollas. Flowers appear in pairs in the leaf axils on slender 1-2"" long pedicels. Each flower purportedly resembles the face of a smiling monkey (hence the common name). Flowers bloom throughout the summer. Sessile, opposite leaves (2-4"" long) are oblong to lanceolate and sharply-toothed.Genus name comes from the Latin diminutive of mimus meaning a mimic as they look like a monkey face.Specific epithet means to gape in reference to the flowers that look like a wide-open mouth.","Problems

 Tuberous rooted tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In St. Louis, it is usually grown as a warm weather annual, though tubers may be dug in fall. It is easily grown in average, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. 
 

 Tolerates a wide range of soils. Sow seed directly in the garden after last frost date, or start seed indoors 6-8 weeks earlier. Set out seedlings, purchased plants/tubers or overwintered tubers after last frost date. Tuberous roots may be dug in fall and stored overwinter in a barely moist medium in a cool dry corner of the basement or frost-free garage. The main advantage to digging the tubers is that plants tend to flower much better from established roots. Plants may self-seed in optimum growing conditions and have escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the southern United States.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Mirabilis jalapa, commonly called four-o-clock or marvel of Peru, is native to Peru. It is a bushy tender perennial that typically grows to 24-36” (less frequently to 48”) tall on erect, branching stems. It is an old garden favorite that features fragrant, funnel-shaped, tubular flowers (2” long) with five flaring petal-like lobes. Flowers blooms from early/mid-summer to fall. Flowers come in pink, rose, red, magenta, yellow and white, sometimes with interesting mottling and striping. Different colored flowers often appear on the same plant. Flowers open in the late afternoon (around four o’clock) and stay open only until the following morning. Flowers are attractive to hummingbirds. Ovate dark green leaves (to 4” long) are heart-shaped at the base. All parts of this plant are poisonous if ingested.Genus name is a Latin word meaning wonderful.Specific epithet means of Jalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soils from well-drained sandy soils to the heavy clays present in much of the St. Louis area. Prefers moist soils. Best in full sun. Less vigorous with decreased flowering and tendency to flop in too much shade. Tolerant of summer heat and humidity. Clumps slowly expand in circumference by short rhizomes, but typically retain tight clump shape. Foliage should be left standing throughout the winter for visual interest and crown protection. Cut foliage close to the ground in late winter just before new shoots appear. Propagate by division of the crown. This grass will reseed to the point of being somewhat invasive in the milder parts of its growing range. Mulch helps prevent reseeding.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Miscanthus sinensis, commonly known as Chinese silver grass, Japanese silver grass or eulalia grass, is a clump-forming warm season grass that typically grows to 3-7’ tall. It is native to lowlands and lower alpine areas in Japan, Korea and China. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in over 25 states in the Central and Eastern U.S. east of the Mississippi River plus in several western States including Colorado and California. 
 

 This grass features a dense clump of upward-arching stems and leaves which give it a rounded, fountain-like appearance. Linear leaves (to 3-4’ long and 3/8” wide) have tapered tips, serrate margins and whitish to silvery midribs. Foliage often turns attractive shades of yellow to orange by mid-fall before gradually fading to beige-tan for winter. Pink to red flowers in feathery, whisk-like, loose terminal panicles (8-10” long) bloom above the foliage from late August to October. Flower panicles gradually turn beige by mid-fall as the seeds mature. Flower panicles and foliage both retain good arching shape, beige color and ornamental interest throughout winter, with enhanced attractiveness often coming from a covering of new fallen snow.  
 

 Miscanthus sinensis will spread somewhat invasively in the landscape, particularly in some of the milder areas of its growing range. It often initially spreads to disturbed sites such as roadsides, railroad right-of-ways or woodland margins. Invasive potential for the species is significant, but is of less concern for many of the numerous ornamental cultivars, some of which are sterile.Genus name comes from the Greek words miskos meaning a stem and anthos meaning flower in reference to the stalked spikelets.Specific epithet means Chinese.This grass was once included in the genus Eulalia, but was subsequently reclassified to the genus Miscanthus with retention of its common name of Eulalia grass by many gardeners.","Problems
 No frequently occurring insect or disease problems. In some areas of the U.S., miscanthus mealybug and miscanthus blight are becoming significant problems. Miscanthus mealybug causes stunted growth and is difficult to eradicate because it lives inside the stems. Miscanthus blight is a fungal disease which attacks the blades and sheaths. Leaf rust may occur.","Garden Uses

 Morus alba, commonly called white mulberry is native to China. It is a rounded, fast-growing, deciduous tree that typically grows to 30-50’ tall and as wide. It usually develops a wide-spreading crown with age. The leaves of this tree have been used in China since at least 2600 B.C. as the primary diet for silkworms used to make silk. Trees were introduced into North America in colonial times in an effort to establish a silk industry. Although the industry never took hold, the trees did take hold and have over time escaped cultivation and naturalized in fields, waste areas, forest margins and along roads throughout much of the U.S. This tree has also been planted in various areas for erosion control and windbreaks. White mulberry is usually dioecious (separate male and female trees), but sometimes is monoecious. Small yellowish-green flowers in drooping catkins bloom in spring (March-April). Fertilized flowers on female trees are followed by sweet, edible blackberry-like fruits (cylindrical drupes to 1” long) that mature in June. Fruits ripen to white or pink, but sometimes to darker reds or purple-blacks. Fruits are loved by birds. Glossy, rounded, usually 2-3 lobed (but sometimes unlobed), dark green leaves (to 8” long) have serrate margins and uneven (sometimes cordate) bases. Glossy leaf surfaces distinguish this tree from red mulberry. Fall color is an unattractive yellow (sometimes green, yellow and brown).Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning white in reference to fruit color.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Borers may be a problem particular in the South. Whiteflies mass on some trees. Bacterial blight may kill foliage/branches. Coral spot cankers may cause twig dieback. Bacterial leaf scorch, powdery mildew and root rot may also occur. Watch for scale, mites and mealybugs. Messy fruit may be a concern.","Garden Uses
 Many gardeners do not consider this tree to have ornamental or fruiting interest. The fruit and resulting bird droppings are messy and will stain pavements, automobiles and areas around the home. Stains may also be unwittingly brought indoors on the bottom of shoes. Species trees often appear unkempt.

 Morus rubra, commonly known as red mulberry, is a medium sized, upright spreading to rounded, deciduous tree that typically grows to 35-50’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. It is native to rich woods, bottomlands and wood margins from Massachusetts, southern Ontario and Minnesota south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in woodlands, rocky places, pastures, fields and along roads throughout the state (Steyermark). It is noted for its often lobed leaves, milky sap, reddish-brown bark and edible fruits. Trees are monoecious or dioecious. Ovate to oblong-ovate, toothed, usually dark green leaves (to 5” long) have heart-shaped bases. Leaves can be quite variable, however, ranging from unlobed to deeply lobed and from rough-textured to glabrous on the upper surfaces. Lobed leaves are more frequently found on new shoots and unlobed leaves are more frequently found in tree crowns. Leaves turn yellow in fall. Unisexual greenish flowers in small catkin-like spikes appear in early spring with male and female flowers usually appearing on separate trees (dioecious). Trees with only male flowers obviously never bear fruit. Fertilized female flowers are followed by sweet blackberry-like edible fruits (to 1” long) that are reddish to dark purple in color.

It is noted for its glossy evergreen dark green leaves, strongly fragrant white flowers and red ornamental fruits. It is native from China and India to Australia. Each odd-pinnate leaf typically has 3 to 9, ovate, glossy, dark green leaflets (to 2.5"" long). Fragrant white flowers (each to 7/8"" across) in terminal or axillary cymes bloom several times throughout the year. Flowers are most fragrant at night. Flowers are followed by ovoid, red fruits (each to 1/2"" long), each with 1-2 seeds. Plants may display flowers and fruits at the same time. Flowers have the scent of orange blossoms, hence the common names of orange jessamine and mock orange that are sometimes applied. Synonymous with Murraya exotica.
 

 Murraya paniculata is a host of the Asian citrus psyllid, which is a vector for the bacterium that causes citrus greening disease (Huanglongbing).Genus name honors Johann Andreas Murray (1740-1791), Swedish pupil of Linnaeus and professor of medicine and botany, Gottingen.Specific epithet refers to the flower inflorescence.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for mealy bugs, scale and whiteflies. Root rot may occur if soils are kept too damp. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants","Garden Uses

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plant bulbs about 3” deep and 3” apart in fall. Flowers emerge in early spring. Keep ground moist during the spring growing season, but reduce watering after foliage begins to die back. Plants are dormant from late spring to autumn when leaves again appear. Leaves survive the cold St. Louis winter (albeit often in an unkempt fashion) before plants burst into flower in early spring. Plants will naturalize by bulb offsets, but not aggressively.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Muscari armeniacum, commonly called grape hyacinth, is an early spring-blooming bulbous perennial that is native to southeastern Europe (including Armenia). It features conical racemes of slightly fragrant, tightly packed, deep violet blue, urn-shaped flowers atop scapes rising to 8” tall in early spring. Each bulb produces 1-3 scapes with 20-40 flowers per scape. Each flower has a thin white line around the rim. Dense inflorescence purportedly resembles an elongated, upside-down bunch of grapes, hence the common name. Scapes rise up from somewhat floppy clumps of narrow, fleshy, basal, green leaves (to 12” long) that appear in autumn and live through the cold St. Louis winter to spring when the plants flower.This genus name was formerly viewed as a subgenus of the genus Muscari which comes from the Turkish name recorded by Clusius in 1583. Possibly from the Latin word muscus in reference to flower aroma.Specific epithet refers to Armenia part of its native range.","Problems

 Nepeta cataria is the true catnip that is loved by house cats. Although native to Europe and Asia, it has over time naturalized in many areas around the world, including much of southern Canada and the U.S. In Missouri, it is typically found throughout the State growing in fields, waste areas, open woodlands, railroad right-of-ways, roadsides and along streams (Steyermark). Catnip typically grows in a spreading clump to 2-3' tall. Erect, branched, square, grayish stems are clad with aromatic, opposite, coarsely-toothed, triangular to ovate, gray-green leaves (to 3"" long). Leaves (above and particularly beneath) and stems are downy which helps give the plant its gray-green appearance. Small, two-lipped, white (with pale purple spotting) flowers (1/4"" long) bloom in spike-like terminal clusters at the stem ends from late spring well into summer. As a medicinal herb, catnip leaves have been used (fresh or dried) for making an herbal tea that reportedly helps reduce anxiety, induce sleep, promote perspiration (fever/cold relief), soothe sore throats (cough suppressant) and comfort upset stomachs. As a culinary herb, fresh leaves (minty flavor) may be chopped and added to soups, stews, sauces, vegetables, or pasta. As a garden plant, catnip acts as a repellant for certain insects, including aphids and squash bugs. Nepetalactone is the active ingredient that affects most cats. To harvest catnip, cut stems to the ground and hang them upside down to cure in a warm location with good air circulation. When leaves are totally dry, crumble them into bags for storage or use immediately for a variety of purposes including herbal teas, potpourris and cat toy fill. Catnip is a vigorous and weedy mint family member that is easy-to-grow, but spreads easily and is not particularly noted for its ornamental qualities in the garden. The common name of catnip is reserved for Nepeta cataria. The similar common name of catmint is given to most other species in the genus. Catmints with showier flowers, better-behaved garden habits but less excitement for cats (leaves less enticing) include certain edgers to 12"" tall (Nepeta x faassennii and Nepeta racemosa) and certain taller plants (Nepeta subsessilis, Nepeta siberica and Nepeta grandiflora). Nepeta racemosa 'Blue Wonder' (Missouri Botanical Garden Plant of Merit) and 'Walker's Low' are popular ornamental cultivars in commerce today.Genus name comes from the Latin name for certain aromatic plants that included catmint.

Catmints with showier flowers, better-behaved garden habits but less excitement for cats (leaves less enticing) include certain edgers to 12"" tall (Nepeta x faassennii and Nepeta racemosa) and certain taller plants (Nepeta subsessilis, Nepeta siberica and Nepeta grandiflora). Nepeta racemosa 'Blue Wonder' (Missouri Botanical Garden Plant of Merit) and 'Walker's Low' are popular ornamental cultivars in commerce today.Genus name comes from the Latin name for certain aromatic plants that included catmint. It may honor the city of Nepete (known as Nepi today) located north of Rome in Etruria which was the ancient country located between the Arno and Tiber Rivers and was recognized, prior to the rise of Rome, as the center of the Etruscan civilization.Specific epithet means pertaining to cats.","Problems

 Nicotiana alata, commonly called flowering tobacco or winged tobacco, is native from southern Brazil to northeastern Argentina. It is a somewhat spindly plant that typically grows 3-5’ tall and features nocturnally fragrant, long-tubed, yellowish-green to white flowers that open only at night. Spatulate basal leaves to 12” long are attached by distinctive winged petioles (alata means winged). Upper stem leaves are much smaller and sessile. Species plants are rarely available except from seed, having been replaced by compact cultivars (to 2’ tall) which feature mostly non-fragrant flowers that open during the day in a variety of colors including red, pink, lime-green and white. The common flowering tobacco compact hybrids (N. alata x N. forgetiana) sold in cell/six packs by nurseries are classified as N. x sanderae (e.g., see Domino, Havana, Merlin, Metro and Starship Series).

 Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, acidic soils. Tolerates poorly-drained soils and can grow in standing water. On the other end of the spectrum, tolerates some drought and adapts to some dryish soils, at least in the wild. Long taproot precludes moving established trees. Female trees need a male pollinator to set fruit.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Nyssa sylvatica, commonly called sour gum, is a slow-growing, deciduous, Missouri native tree which occurs in a wide range of soils south of the Missouri River in the southeastern quarter of the State. It is primarily a lowland tree found in low wet woods, bottomlands and pond peripheries, but also can be found on dry rocky wooded slopes and ravines. A stately tree with a straight trunk and rounded crown (more pyramidal when young) that typically grows 30-50' tall, but occasionally to 90'. Primarily dioecious (separate male and female trees), but each tree often has some perfect flowers. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in spring on long stalks (female flowers in sparse clusters and male flowers in dense heads). Although flowers are not showy, they are an excellent nectar source for bees. Flowers give way to oval, 1/2"" long fruits which are technically edible but quite sour (hence the common name). Fruits mature to a dark blue and are attractive to birds and wildlife. Spectacular scarlet fall color. Obovate to elliptic, entire to slightly toothed leaves (to 5"" long) are dark green above and paler below. Sometimes commonly called black tupelo. The closely related water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) is a tree most often seen growing in standing water in swamps and bottomlands in the lower Mississippi valley and southeastern U.S. coastal areas, either in pure stands or in combination with bald cypress, water oaks and swamp cottonwoods.Genus name comes from Nysa or Nyssa, one of the water nymphs.Specific epithet means growing in the woods or forest-loving.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spots, canker, rust, leaf miner and scale.","Garden Uses
 Excellent ornamental shade tree for lawns or street tree. Also grows well in moist woodland gardens or naturalized areas or in low spots subject to periodic flooding or in boggy areas. Although slow-growing, it still needs to be sited in an area which affords plenty of room for future growth, particularly since it is so difficult to transplant.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Easily grown from seed sown outdoors in fall or early spring. Plants will spread, sometimes aggressively, by rhizomes and self-seeding to form large colonies.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Oenothera speciosa, commonly called white evening primrose, features fragrant, bowl-shaped, four-petaled, white flowers (to 2-3” diameter) with yellow anthers that bloom from the upper leaf axils in spring (May-July). Flowers often mature to rosy pink as noted by this plant’s additional common names of pink evening primrose and pink ladies. This showy (showy evening primrose also works as a common name) but somewhat aggressive, spreading perennial was originally native to rocky prairies and plains from Missouri and Kansas south to Texas and Mexico, but it has over time naturalized into many other sites (e.g., fields, waste areas, roadsides and along railroads) from Illinois and Louisiana east to Pennsylvania and Florida. It grows to 10-24” tall on erect to sprawling stems, and spreads by rhizomes to 18” wide or more. Narrow, lanceolate to oblanceolate, medium green leaves (to 1-3” long) sometimes have small lobes near the leaf bases. Flowers open in the evening and remain open to late morning (all day if overcast). Flowers are followed by oval, ridged, seed capsules (to 2” long).Genus name is unclear but may have come from the Greek words oinos and theras meaning wine-seeker in probable reference to an ancient use of the roots of genus plants in scenting wine.Specific epithet is in reference to the large showy flowers.","Problems

It is native to woodland areas in Japan and Korea. Foliage is similar to that of Liriope (also in the lily family), but leaves are narrower and more refined. Small, 6-tepaled, bell-shaped, white to lilac-tinted flowers (1/4” wide) bloom in summer in short racemes (2-3” long) atop leafless stalks. Flowers are followed by spherical, pea-sized, blue-black berries (1/4” across). Flowers and fruits are usually partially hidden by the foliage. This plant is ornamentally grown for its tufts of grass-like leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek ophis meaning snake and pogon meaning beard.Specific epithet means of Japan in reference to native habitat.","Problems

Start seed indoors about 6 to 8 weeks prior to last spring frost date or sow seed outdoors about two weeks prior to last spring frost date. New plants may also be purchased in cell packs at local nurseries. Cut back stems before flowers appear to encourage bushy growth. Leaf flavor is usually best before flowers bloom. Container plants may be brought indoors in fall before frost, but they usually do not overwinter well.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Origanum majorana, commonly called sweet marjorum, is a bushy sub-shrub with aromatic foliage that typically grows in an upright mound to 1-2' tall. It is widely cultivated as an annual culinary herb. Leaves are milder with a more delicate flavor than those of perennial oregano (Origanum vulgare). Sweet marjorum features branching, reddish, square stems that are densely clad with ovate, highly aromatic, pubescent, gray-green leaves (to 1.25"" long). Tiny, two-lipped, tubular, white or pale pink flowers with gray-green bracts bloom in spike-like clusters from mid to late summer. Flowers are not particularly showy. Marjorum is a popular herb (fresh or dried) for seasoning soups, sauces, salads, stuffings, stews, roasts, vegetables and meats. Fresh leaves do not freeze as well as oregano leaves. Dried leaves are sometimes added to potpourris.Genus name probably comes from the Greek words oros meaning mountain and gamos meaning beauty in reference to the physical appearance of this plant which is sometimes native of mountain areas where it is appropriately referred to as “beauty of the mountain”.","Problems

Best propagated from cuttings taken from plants whose leaves have a proven superior aroma/taste (seed-grown plants sometimes have little aroma or flavor) when harvest of leaves for culinary purposes is desired. Leaves with good flavor may be clipped fresh as needed or dried for year-round use. Best leaf flavor usually occurs just prior to flowering.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Origanum vulgare, commonly known as oregano, is a bushy, rhizomatous, woody-branched perennial which typically grows to 1-3’ tall and to 2’ wide on square stems clad with aromatic, glandular-spotted, rounded to ovate leaves (to 1 1/2” long) which are usually entire but sometimes have slightly toothed margins. Tiny, two-lipped, pinkish-purple or white flowers (typical mint family), each with 4 protruding stamens and leafy purple-toned bracts, bloom in axillary or terminal corymb-like spikelets which rise above the foliage in summer. Plants are native from Europe to central Asia, but have escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the eastern and far western U.S. and Canada. 
 

 Origanum vulgare plants are primarily sold in commerce today under a number of different cultivar, subspecies or varietal names, each geared toward a specific culinary and/or ornamental usage. Some plants produce leaves with great flavor/aroma (e.g., O. vulgare subsp. hirtum known as Greek oregano is the standard culinary spice rack oregano) but have little ornamental value. Other plants have great ornamental value in regard to having golden, variegated or curly leaves (e.g., O. vulgare ‘Aureum’ features golden yellow foliage) but little or no culinary value. The straight species is a robust but relatively common plant that is, as a general rule, seldom sold for a specific ornamental or culinary use.
 

 Flavorful leaves from certain O. vulgare cultivars, subspecies or varietal plants are commonly used, either fresh or dried, as culinary herbs for a variety of food dishes, particularly in tomato sauces used in Italian cuisine and pizza, but also in a number of additional applications including rice, soups, stews, dressings, vegetable dishes, egg dishes, dips and herbal vinegars. Leaf flavor can vary considerable depending on climate and growing conditions.  
 

 The genus Origanum contains 45 species, 6 subspecies and 3 varieties. The common name of oregano describes a flavor as opposed to a specific botanical genus or species.Genus name probably comes from the Greek words oros meaning mountain and gamos meaning beauty in reference to the physical appearance of this plant which is sometimes native of mountain areas where it is appropriately referred to as “beauty of the mountain”.Specific epithet is from the Latin vulgaris meaning common.","Problems

 Pachira aquatica is known by a large number of common names including water chestnut, Guiana chestnut and Malabar chestnut. In addition, it is often commercially sold as a houseplant or bonsai under the name of money tree or money plant. In the wild, this is a tropical evergreen estuarine species that is native to freshwater swamps, estuaries and river banks in tropical rainforests from Mexico to northern South America. It is cultivated in Hawaii and southern California. It is typically grown outdoors in frost-free climates as a tropical ornamental and/or for harvest of its edible nuts. In cooler climates, it is often grown indoors as a foliage houseplant (rarely flowers) or bonsai, often in a braided trunk form. Water chestnut is an evergreen tree or large shrub that will grow to 60' tall in its native habitat, but usually smaller (to 30') in home landscapes. Houseplants typically grow to 6-8' tall. Each palmately compound leaf has 5-9, elliptic to lance-shaped, shiny green leaflets (to 5-10"" long). Large, greenish to yellowish-white flowers feature five long cream-colored petals surrounding 200-250 tightly-packed, red-tipped stamens (to 3-4"" long). Bushy stamens have a shaving-brush like appearance. Flowers bloom for one day and are fragrant at night. Fruit is a heavy, woody, brown capsule (to 12"" long) that bursts when mature to release edible nuts (seeds) which may be eaten raw or roasted or ground into flour. Young leaves and flowers may be cooked as a vegetable.Genus name comes from the native Guyanese name.Specific epithet means growing in or near water.Common name of money tree comes from an old tale in which a poor man acquired wealth by discovering this tree and selling its seeds.

 Easily grown in rich, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants need abundant moisture during the early part of the growing season. Plants appreciate some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Add compost as needed before planting. Rootstock buds (eyes) should be planted about 2” below the soil surface. Each plant will flower for approximately 7-10 days. P. lactiflora is a late blooming species (May-early June). Peony bloom time in the garden can be extended to about 6 weeks (late April-early June) by growing a combination of early, midseason and late blooming cultivars. Remove spent flowers after bloom. Cut foliage to the ground and remove from the garden in fall after frost. Plants are long-lived, do not need to be divided and can be left undisturbed for years. Plants need a cold winter dormant season. Best performance typically occurs in USDA Zones 5-7, but plants often perform well in the northern parts of Zone 8. Cover root areas with mulch in winter, especially in climates where snow cover is minimal. Named cultivars will not come true from seed.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Paeonia lactiflora, commonly known as common garden peony or Chinese peony, is an erect, clump-forming, shrub-like, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 20-30” tall on stems tinged with red. It is classified as a late-blooming species, featuring flowers in mid- to late spring and continuing attractive foliage throughout the summer and early fall. Stems die to the ground after frost. This species is native to central Asia, ranging from eastern Siberia to Mongolia to eastern Tibet to northern China. It has been grown in China since the 7th century for appreciation of its ornamental flowers. It was introduced into North America in the 1800s. Dark green compound leaves 8-12” long have 9 elliptic leaflets with irregular margins. Leaves may turn rusty orange in fall. Cup or bowl shaped flowers (3-5” across) with 8-10 white, pink or crimson petals typically feature a conspicuous center boss of yellow stamens. Some double-flowered cultivars are available. Flowers of most cultivars are fragrant. Fruits consist of horizontally spreading follicles that split open at maturity. Plants have thickened tuberous roots.Genus name comes from the Greek name for Paeon, physician of the gods and reputed discoverer of the medicinal properties of plants in this genus.Specific epithet means with milk-white flowers.Species plants are rarely sold in commerce, but many cultivars and hybrids are available. Most of the garden peonies sold in commerce today are hybrids. The American Peony Society recognizes over 8000 named cultivars. Cultivar flower colors include white, purple, pink, and red.","Problems
 Peonies are considered to be relatively pest free. Botyrtis blight and Phytopthora blight are sometimes problems. Ants on peony buds are common and totally harmless. If plants do not flower, possible causes include: (1) planted too deep or too shallow, (2) planted in too much shade, (3) late frost killed flower buds or (4) plant is too young or has been recently moved or disturbed. Large, semi-double blooms may need staking or other support because they tend to arch toward the ground in the best of weather and can be literally driven into the ground by a hard rain. Potential insect pests include thrips, scale, mealybugs, bulb mites and hoplia beetles. Powdery mildew is common on the leaves in the fall and is not harmful to the plant. If considered unsightly, the foliage can be cut back at this time. Deer and rabbits tend to avoid these plants.","Garden Uses
 Peonies are a standard of the perennial border, both as specimens and in groups. They are long-lived perennials, and are effective as accents or herbaceous hedges along fences, sidewalks, driveways or walls. Flowers are extremely showy, and foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season either alone or as a frame or backdrop for other perennials.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates full shade. Best fall color generally occurs in sunny locations. This is an easy-to-grow plant with good tolerance for a wide range of soils and urban conditions. It often needs little care, but must be trimmed regularly to keep it in bounds. It should be sited in areas where it will have room to expand and grow. It should not be grown up wood or shingle walls because the holdfasts are difficult to remove. It can ruin painted surfaces. If unchecked, vines can also attach to and seriously damage such objects as gutters, shutters or wiring around homes and buildings.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Parthenocissus quinquefolia is a deciduous, woody vine that is commonly called Virginia creeper or woodbine. It is native to eastern and central North America south to Mexico. It occurs statewide in Missouri, typically being located in open areas of ravines, valleys, rich woods, thickets, rocky bluffs, hillsides and fencerows (Steyermark). This is a vigorous tendril-climbing vine that will rapidly grow to 30-50’ long or more. It needs no support because it clings to surfaces (e.g., brick, stone or wood walls) by adhesive holdfasts (also called sucker disks) located at the tendril ends. It also will creep along the ground as suggested by the common name. Compound-palmate leaves (usually 5 saw-toothed leaflets, each leaflet to 6” long) emerge purplish in spring, mature to dull green in summer and change to attractive shades of purple and crimson red in fall. Greenish white flowers in late spring to early summer appear in the upper leaf axils, but are generally hidden by the foliage and are ornamentally insignificant. Flowers give way to blue-black berries (to 3/8” diameter) which are also hidden by the foliage and are often not visible until autumn leaf drop. Birds eat the berries.Genus name comes from the Greek words parthenos meaning a virgin and kissos meaning ivy.Specific epithet means five-leaved in reference to the palmate leaves.

 Passiflora edulis, commonly called purple passionfruit, is a shallow-rooted, tendril-climbing, evergreen vine that typically grows to 10-15’ long and to 3-5’ wide and produces extremely showy bowl-shaped fragrant purple-white passionflowers (each to 3” wide) followed by edible, ovoid, purple passionfruits (to 2"" across). P. edulis f. flavicarpa is a yellow-fruited form commonly called yellow passionfruit. Purple passionfruit is native to Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, but is now grown in tropical and subtropical climates throughout the world. This vine clings to supports by coiled tendrils. Individual flowers bloom for one day. Each flower has 5 greenish-white sepals, 5 white petals and a decorative corona of white filaments which are showy purple at the bases. In Florida, the purple-white flowers begin blooming in early spring with the passionfruits typically ripening about 80 days after flowering occurs (from late May to July). Each fruit has a rough rind with as many as 250 tiny seeds inside, each seed being surrounded by an orange sac containing juice. Ripe fruits are edible off the vine or incorporated into a variety of food products such as beverages, jellies, fruit salads and sherbets. Three-lobed evergreen leaves (to 3-8"" long) are finely-toothed, deep green and glossy above but dull green below. Young stems are tinged with red or purple. Glossy, three-lobed leaves (3-5"" long) with serrate margins have two small glands on the stalks.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10-11. In St. Louis, grow as annuals in the ground or in containers or hanging baskets. In the ground, grow in average to organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils with a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Water regularly during the growing season. Best in full sun, but appreciates some light shade in the heat of the day. Best flowering occurs when nights are cool (50s-60s). Promptly deadhead spent flowering stems. Pinch stems to prevent legginess and promote bushiness. Although ivy geraniums may be overwintered indoors, many gardeners simply grow them as annuals and repurchase new plants each spring. If overwintering is desired, several options are available: (1) as a houseplant by bringing containers indoors in fall before frost and placing in a bright, sunny but cool window with reduced watering or (2) as a dormant plant by bringing containers inside before first frost and placing them in a cool dark corner of the basement or frost free area of a garage. Dormant overwintering is generally advisable in order to promote the most vigorous flowering for the following growing season. Cuttings may also be taken from favorite plants in late summer for overwintering or in early spring from overwintered plants.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pelargonium peltatum, known as ivy geraniums, are tender perennials with somewhat brittle, trailing stems that spread to as much as 3’ wide. They feature thick, lobed, medium green, ivy-like leaves and clusters of single or double flowers in shades of red, pink, lilac or white. Flowers appear throughout the growing season. Many of the ivy geraniums sold in commerce today are hybrids in which P. peltatum is a main parent.Genus name comes from the Greek word pelargos meaning a stork. The fruit has a beak like a stork.Specific epithet refers to the plant's peltate leaves.","Problems
 Watch for oedema, a physiological leaf problem in which brownish water blisters appear on leaf surfaces, usually as a result of overwatering. Poorly drained soils inevitably lead to stem and root rots. Watch for whiteflies and aphids, particularly on indoor plants.

 Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Best in full sun. Tolerates part shade, but may not flower in too much shade. Prefers sandy loams and regular moisture with good drainage. Avoid heavy clay soils. Established plants tolerate some drought. Cut foliage to the ground in late winter before new shoots appear. Species plants are only winter hardy to USDA Zone 6.‘Karley Rose’ is reportedly winter hardy to USDA Zone 5a, which encompasses the entire St. Louis metropolian area.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pennisetum orientale is a warm season fountain grass that is native to Asia. It is an ornamental grass that typically forms graceful, spreading foliage clumps to 18” tall and as wide of narrow, gray-green leaves (to 1/4” wide). Showy, fluffy, pinkish-white flower spikes arch upward and outward from the foliage clump in late summer like water spraying from a fountain, hence the common name. Flower spikes rise well above the foliage to 2.5-3’ tall. Flower spikes persist over a very long bloom period from early June to August before eventually disintegrating. Foliage changes to yellowish-tan in fall, and usually remain attractive throughout the winter.Genus name comes from the Latin penna meaning feather and seta meaning bristle in reference to the flowers having long, feathery bristles.Specific epithet means of the Orient.‘Karley Rose’ is distinguished from the species by having (1) deeper green foliage, (2) darker, smoky rose-purple flower spikes that are larger and fuller, (3) longer bloom period extending into September and (4) better winter hardiness.

In St. Louis, it will not survive winter and is typically grown as if it were an annual. Although species plants can be grown from seed each year new plants are typically purchased from nurseries each spring for planting in the garden after last spring frost date. Technically plants can be dug in fall, trimmed and overwintered in greenhouses or indoors in sunny cool areas, but many gardeners simply prefer to purchase new plants each spring. Plants may need some staking or other support and should be sited in areas protected from strong winds. Provide consistent water throughout the growing season.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pennisetum setaceum is a tender perennial fountain grass that is native to Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East. It is a rapid-growing, clump-forming grass that produces arching, linear, narrow green leaves to 3’ tall and late summer flower spikes that rise above the foliage to 4’ tall. In warm areas where in may be grown as a perennial, it readily self seeds. In colder areas it dies in winter. Location means everything. Overall clump appearance is reminiscent of water spraying from a fountain, hence the common name.Genus name comes from the Latin penna meaning feather and seta meaning bristle in reference to the flowers having long, feathery bristles.Specific epithet means bristled.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual. Best performance occurs in moist, loose, humusy, organically rich soils in full sun. Plants also tolerate light shade. Plants have excellent resistance to heat and drought. Pinch plant stem tips as needed to keep plants compact and to promote bushiness. Plants will freely self-seed in the garden. Deadhead spent flowers promptly to avoid any unwanted self-seeding. Inexpensive starter plants (in small pots or flats) can be purchased from some nurseries in spring for beds and for containers. In the alternative, seed can be started indoors 8-12 weeks before last frost date or planted outdoors at last frost date. Containers may be brought inside in fall before frost for overwintering. Similarly, favorite plants may be dug and potted in fall for overwintering as houseplants. Plants may be easily propagated by cuttings.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Perilla frutescens, commonly called beefsteak plant, is an upright, bushy annual that is native from the Himalayas to Southeast Asia. It is related to coleus and basil. It has become a very popular foliage annual and salad herb plant. It grows to 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall. Wrinkled, serrate, broad ovate, medium green leaves (to 4” long) are sometimes tinged with purple. Leaves are aromatic. Two-lipped nettle-like white flowers in spike-like inflorescences (to 4”) bloom at the stem tips in late summer and fall (August – October). Flowers are not particularly showy. This plant has escaped gardens and naturalized throughout many areas of the eastern and central U.S., including central and southern Missouri. Fresh leaves are used in Oriental cooking, salads, soups and as garnishes.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it grows best in rich, loose, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants will tolerate some light shade, but are best in warm and sunny conditions. Intolerant of frost. Commercial varieties are planted by rootstocks or grafting. Houseplants are often grown from seed which may be sprouted in water or directly in soil. For sprouting in water, wash the seed, insert three toothpicks into the side of the seed halfway up and suspend the seed in a glass of water (broad end down) with water covering the bottom 1/3 of the seed. Change water regularly. When seed splits and roots appear (2-6 weeks), transplant to a pot with plotting soil. Pits may also be planted directly in soil (rather than using the water glass routine), with 2/3 of the pit under an evenly moist but not wet soil. Established plants like sunny windows. Fertilize mature plants regularly in spring and summer. Indoor plants are attractive but normally will not produce fruit.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Persea americana, called avocado, is a multi-stemmed tropical evergreen tree that is native to Mexico, Central America and South America. It typically matures to 30-60' tall, however grafted varieties generally grow shorter. Avocado leaves (to 4-8""long) are typically glossy, elliptic to ovate and dark green. Small greenish-yellow flowers bloom in panicles, followed by green-skinned, pear-shaped to rounded fruit. Each fruit has a very large central seed or pit surrounded by an edible fruity pulp. Mature fruits ripen off the tree, with the edible flesh turning yellow with a rich buttery consistency. Avocados are rich in vitamins and monounsaturated fat. Avocado is a fruit, but is commonly used as a vegetable, in salads and for guacamole. Varieties have different blooming/fruiting seasons, hence avocados in general are harvested year round. Avocados are grown commercially in southern California and southern Florida. Typical California varieties (e.g., Haas, Gwen, Pinkerton, Fuerte and Reed) are mostly Guatemalan types that have thick pebbly skins. Typical Florida varieties are West Indian (e.g., Donnie and Simmonds) and Guatemalan-West Indian hybrids (e.g., Booth 8, Choquette, and Monroe) that are larger and smooth to slightly pebbled skinned. In the U.S., approximately 95% of the commercial crop comes from southern California, with Hass accounting for about 80% of that crop.Genus name comes from the Greek name persea for an Egyptian tree (Cordia myxa).Specific epithet means of the Americas.Avocado comes from an Aztec word meaning testicle in apparent reference to the fruit shape.","Problems
 Currently avocado trees are threatened by laurel wilt. Laurel wilt is caused by Raffaelea lauricola and vectored by several ambrosia beetle species. Trees infected with laurel wilt usually die within 4 to 8 weeks. Houseplants may develop root rot in overly wet soils. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants","Garden Uses

 Parsley is a biennial that is typically grown in St. Louis as an annual. It is easily grown in average, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. It prefers rich soils. Do not allow soils to dry out. Plants perform best in cool summer climates, and sometimes tend to languish in the hot and humid summers of the deep South. Starter plants may be planted 8-12"" apart in the garden around the last spring frost date. Plants may also be grown from seed, but this is more difficult because germination is slow and usually uneven. Seed may be started indoors about 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Seed may also be started outdoors in the garden as of last spring frost date. Additional seed may be planted in the garden later in spring and in mid-summer. If desired, bring containers or dug-up plants indoors in fall before first frost for overwintering (site in a cool sunny window or under lights).","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Petroselinum crispum, called parsley, is a culinary herb that is native to Europe and the Mediterranean. It is now grown world-wide for its is aromatic edible leaves which may be used fresh or dried in soups, salads and a wide variety of other food dishes (e.g., potatoes, fish, stews, vegetables, omelets). It is popularly used as a garnish. It typically grows in a clump to 12"" tall and as wide. Triangular dark green leaves are finely divided into curly or flat leaflets. Leaves remain harvestable until temperatures drop into the low 20s F., but will remain strong throughout winter in warm winter climates. Plants will bloom in the 2nd year by sending up stalks to 2-3' tall bearing compound umbels of greenish-yellow flowers. Unfortunately, leaves lose good flavor in the second year when plants are in flower. Three kinds of parsley are currently in use: curly leaved parsley (var. crispum), Italian or flat-leaved parsley (var. neapolitanum) and Hamburg parsley (var. tuberosum). Curly leaved is the most popular. Flat leaved has plain leaves with stronger flavor. Hamburg is grown for its swollen parsnip-like roots which may be boiled and eaten as a vegetable. Parsley is high in vitamin A, vitamin C, several of the B complex vitamins and a number of minerals including potassium, iron, copper and manganese. Parsley is a larval food plant for the black swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek words petros meaning a rock and selinon meaning parsley or celery.Specific epithet means finely waved or closely curled.","Problems

 Best grown in consistently moist, fertile, organically-rich, well-drained loams in full sun. Propagate by seed which should be planted at the time of the last spring frost date. Bush beans are usually planted without support in rows. Pole beans are also best grown in rows but up a pole, stake or tripod.  Harvest time for beans is 45-60 days for common bush beans, 55-65 days for pole beans and 75-100 or more days for shell/dry beans.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Phaseolus vulgaris, commonly known as bean, is a large genus of annual vegetables in the pea family that are primarily native to Central America and South America, with a few species native to North America. Columbus reportedly introduced some plants of this genus to the Mediterranean in 1493 when he returned from his second voyage to the New World.
 

 Beans are legumes which acquire nitrogen from the air. Beans in this genus have trifoliate compound leaves with ovate to ovate-orbicular leaflets, bilaterally symmetrical pea-shaped flowers in clusters from the leaf axils and elongate pods that contain from three to a dozen or more seeds. Colors and shapes of pods and seeds vary considerably.  
 

 Common names given to bean varieties generally refer to culinary use. Commercially, most beans in the genus are classified as (1) pod/snap beans (string beans, stringless beans, pole beans or wax beans in tender tasty immature pods), (2) shell beans (pod is not eaten, but beans are shelled from the pod when swollen and somewhat dry but prior to full maturity) or (3) dry beans (removed from the pod at full maturity only after totally drying and beginning to rattle around inside the pod). Examples of dry beans (some of which may be shelled if picked prior to maturity) include black beans, cranberry beans, kidney beans, pea beans, pinto beans, white beans, navy beans, yellow beans and cannellini.  
 

 Common green beans in edible pods are the most important food legume in the world today.  Bush varieties are self-supporting and generally grow to 18-30” tall or more. Climbing or trailing varieties (pole beans) need a support structure on which to grow, but may be allowed to trail along the ground with stems growing to as much as 15’ in length. Flowers are pink, red, white or yellow. Pods are green, purple or yellow.Genus name comes from the Greek word for fava beans or an ancient Greek one for a species of Vigna.Specific epithet from Latin means common.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Mosaic viral disease (stunted yellow-mottled leaves), bacterial blight (irregular brown leaf blotches surrounded by yellow halos), and anthracnose (cankered pods) may appear. Additional potential disease problems include powdery mildew and white mold. Mexican bean beetles and Japanese beetles may chew holes in foliage.

 Phlox pilosa, commonly known as prairie phlox or downy phlox, is native from Connecticut to Ontario and Manitoba south to Louisiana and Florida. In Missouri, it is typically found in rocky or dry open woods, valleys, thickets, meadows, prairies and glades (Steyermark) throughout most of the State. This is an upright perennial that grows in a clump to 12-16"" (less frequently to 24"") tall on stiff stems clad with opposite, widely-spaced, sharp pointed, linear to linear-lanceolate, stalkless, deep green leaves (each to 4"" long and 3/4"" wide) with prominent central veins. Leaves are often finely pubescent. Fragrant, tubular, pink to pale purple flowers (to 3/4” diameter) are loosely packed in rounded terminal clusters (cymes). Flowers bloom from May to July with a possible sparse rebloom in fall. Each individual flower has a long corolla tube and five flat petal-like lobes which lack notches. Stems, leaves and corolla tubes are often covered with soft white hairs, hence the specific epithet of pilosa means soft hairy and the sometimes used common name of downy phlox. Butterflies love the flowers. USDA currently lists nine different subspecies for this plant (deamii, detonsa, fulgida, latisepala, ozarkana, pilosa, pulcherima, riparia and sangamonensis).The genus name is derived from the Greek word phlox meaning flame in reference to the intense flower colors of some varieties.","Problems

 Physocarpus opulifolius, commonly called ninebark, is an upright, spreading, somewhat coarse, deciduous, Missouri-native shrub which is closely related to genus Spiraea. In Missouri, it typically occurs along streams, rocky banks, gravel bars and in moist thickets, especially in counties south of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Grows 5-9’ tall (less frequently to 10’). Noted for its exfoliating bark (on mature branches) which peels in strips to reveal several layers of reddish to light brown inner bark (hence the common name of ninebark). Bark provides winter interest, but is usually hidden by the foliage during the growing season. Features small pink or white, five-petaled flowers appearing in dense, flat, rounded, 1-2” diameter, spirea-like clusters (corymbs) in late spring. Flowers give way to drooping clusters of reddish fruit (inflated seed capsules). Ovate to rounded, usually 3-5 lobed leaves (to 4” long) are dull green in summer changing to an undistinguished yellow in fall.Genus name comes from the Greek physa meaning a bladder and karpos meaning fruit, referring to the inflated dry fruits of the plant.Specific epithet refers to the leaves that resemble those of Viburnum opulus.Common name of ninebark is in reference to its ornamental attractive exfoliating bark.","Problems

In Missouri, it is commonly found in a variety of habitats including open meadows, prairies, stream banks, gravel bars, wooded bluff bases and railroad track right-of-ways (Steyermark). Tubular, two-lipped, snapdragon-like, pink to pale lilac flowers in upright terminal spikes (each to 12-18”) bloom throughout summer (late June-September) atop square stems rising to 2-4’ tall. Flowers bloom bottom to top on each spike, with each flower being subtended by a small leaf-like bract. Stems are clad with opposite, narrow-lanceolate, sharply-toothed leaves (to 3-6” long). Species plants are noted for being aggressive spreaders in the landscape by both rhizomes and self-seeding.Genus name comes from the Greek words physa meaning bladder and stege meaning covering in reference to the calyces which inflate as they develop.Specific epithet is in reference to the State of Virginia which is part of the native range for this plant.Genus members are commonly called obedient plants because each individual flower will, upon being pushed in any one direction, temporarily remain in the new position as if it were hinged. Genus members are also commonly called false dragonhead because the flowers are suggestive of the flowers of dragonhead (Dracocephalum).","Problems

 Pinus ponderosa, commonly called Ponderosa pine, is the dominant pine tree of the western U.S. It usually grows best at elevations of 4000-8500 feet. It is native primarily to mountain areas from British Columbia to Mexico east to North Dakota, Nebraska and Texas. It is the State Tree of Montana. It often grows in pure stands. This is a large conifer (ponderous as the species and common names suggest) that typically grows in a conical form to 60-125’ in cultivation, but may reach 225’ tall or more in the wild. In the western U.S., only the sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) grows taller. Ponderosa pine trunks grow to 4’ in diameter. Trees may live to 600 years. Dark yellow-green needles (5-10” long) in bundles of three (infrequently bundles of two) are concentrated in tufts at the branch ends. Oval cones (4-6” long) grow upright, but turn upside down at muturity to release seed. Bark on young trees is dark brown to black.

 Pinus strobus, commonly called Eastern white pine, is a rapid-growing, long-lived, needled evergreen tree that is native to the northeastern United States and Canada (State tree of Maine and Michigan). Although pyramidal in its early years, it matures to a broad oval habit with an irregular crown. Typically grows 50-80' in cultivation, but will grow to 100' tall in the wild, with records existing to over 200'. Landscape size and shape can be controlled through pruning, however, to the extent that white pine may be sheared and grown as a hedge. Bluish green needles (to 5"" long) are soft to the touch and appear in bundles of five. Cylindrical, brown cones ( 4-8"" long) are usually not produced until 5-10 years. An important timber tree (perhaps more so in the 18th and 19th centuries than now) which was and is valued for its lightweight, straight-grained wood (orange heartwood and white sapwood).Genus name comes from the Latin name for pines.Specific epithet in Greek means cone but here it may refer to an incense-bearing or gum-yielding tree.","Problems
 In cool summer locations, white pine can grow quite well. It is, however, susceptible to a large number of insect and disease problems. Blights and rusts are the main diseases, with its most dangerous enemy being white pine blister rust which is a bark disease that is usually fatal. Species of Ribes (e.g., currants and gooseberries) are the alternate host for white pine blister rust and should not be planted in areas where white pines are under attack. White pine blister rust is not currently a problem in Missouri. Additional disease problems of significance include canker. Insect problems include white pine weevil, bark beetles, white pine shoot borer, Zimmerman moth larvae, pine sawfly, scale and aphids.

 Pittosporum tobira, commonly known as Japanese pittosporum, is a rounded, broadleaved evergreen shrub or small tree that is native to Japan, Korea and China. It is also sometimes commonly called mock orange or Austrian laurel. In the U.S., it is commonly grown in Florida, along the Gulf Coast and on the West coast. Plants typically grow as dense shrubs to 10-15’ tall, but may be kept smaller by pruning. In containers, they are usually grown much smaller (to 4’ tall). Obovate, leathery, evergreen, glossy, dark green leaves (1-5” long) with downward rolled margins are arranged in whorl-like patterns along the stems. Leaves are dull green beneath. Small 5-petaled pure white flowers (aging to creamy yellow) bloom in umbel-like clusters at the branch tips in spring (April – May). Flowers have the sweet fragrance of orange blossoms. Flowers give way to 3-valved green capsules that ripen to brown in fall but are often concealed by the foliage.

 Platanus occidentalis, commonly called sycamore, American sycamore, eastern sycamore, buttonwood or buttonball tree, is generally regarded to be the most massive tree indigenous to eastern North America. It is a deciduous, usually single-trunk tree that typically grows to 75-100’ (less frequently to 150’) tall with horizontal branching and a rounded habit. Trunk diameter typically ranges from 3-8’, with some records up to 16’. Although tulip tree (see Liriodendron tulipifera) may reach similar heights, its trunk diameters are generally smaller. Sycamore is native to lowland areas, typically reaching its largest size along streams, rivers and flood plains. It is commonly found throughout the State of Missouri. The signature ornamental feature of this huge tree is its brown bark which exfoliates in irregular pieces to reveal creamy white inner bark. Mature trees typically display mottled white bark that facilitates identification from great distances. The large 3-5 lobed medium to dark green leaves (4-10” wide) have coarse marginal teeth. In fall, foliage typically turns an undistinguished yellow-brown. Small, non-showy, monoecious flowers appear in small rounded clusters in April. Male flowers are yellowish and female flowers are reddish. Female flowers give way to fuzzy, long-stalked, spherical fruiting balls (to 1 3/8” diameter) that ripen to brown in October and persist into early winter. Each fruiting ball consists of numerous, densely-packed, tiny seed-like fruits (achenes). Fruiting balls gradually disintegrate as fall progresses, dispursing their seeds, often in downy tufts, with the wind. Wood has been commercially used for a variety of products including furniture, cabinets, barrels, crates and butcher blocks. Native Americans hollowed out trunk sections for dugout canoes.Genus name comes from the Greek word, platanos, for the oriental plane tree (P. orientalis).Specific epithet means Western.European settlers reportedly gave this tree the common name of sycamore because the foliage resembled the sycamore of the British Isles (Acer pseudoplatanus) which is actually a maple.","Problems
 Sycamore anthracnose is a significant disease that can severely damage the foliage and twigs, often precipitating premature leaf drop. Canker, leaf spot and powdery mildew may also occur.

 Best grown in light, medium moisture, organically rich, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Avoid wet or poorly-drained soils. Plants are easily grown from seed. Division and transplanting are possible but tricky because of the fragile, fleshy root systems of these plants, and it is probably best to leave plants undisturbed once established. Deadheading spent flowers generally prolongs the bloom period. New season plant stems emerge late in spring, so gardeners must be careful not to damage crowns by early cultivation (leaving old plant stems in place throughout winter to the point when the new growth first appears helps mark plant locations). Taller plants often need to be staked because of floppy stems. Consider cutting back plant stems by 1/2 in May to reduce plant height and possibly avoid staking.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Platycodon grandiflorus, commonly called balloon flower, is a clump-forming perennial that is so named because its flower buds puff up like balloons before bursting open into outward-to-upward-facing, bell-shaped flowers with five pointed lobes. Plants are native to slopes and meadows in China, Japan, Korea and Siberia. Purple-blue flowers (to 2-3” across) bloom throughout summer, singly or in small clusters, atop stems typically growing to 30” tall. Ovate to lance-shaped, toothed, blue-green leaves (to 2” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words platys meaning broad and kodon meaning a bell for the shape of the corolla.Specific epithet means large-flowered.","Problems

 Plumbago auriculata, commonly called cape leadwort or cape plumbago, Native to South Africa. It is a weak-stemmed perennial evergreen shrub that grows 6-7’ tall and 8-10’ wide in its native habitat. When grown in containers in St. Louis, it more typically will grow 1-3’ per year and is often kept relatively compact through periodic prunings and/or a hard annual pruning. Features clusters (terminal racemes) of pale blue phlox-like flowers that bloom freely throughout the growing season. Flowers are followed by barbed fruit capsules. Oblong to oblanceolate green leaves (to 3” long) have ear-shaped bases, hence the species name. Ceratostigma plumbaginoides, a low-growing ground cover that is winter hardy to St. Louis and is grown at the Kemper Center, is in the same family as the within plant and is commonly called plumbago.Genus name comes from the Latin name derived from plumbum meaning lead and ago a termination of many Latin plant names used to indicate a resemblance or a property.Specific epithet refers to the ear-shaped bases of the leaves.","Problems

 Kentucky blue grass (hereinafter KBG) is best grown in fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers cool climates, neutral to slightly acidic soils, frequent watering (1-1.5"" per week) and periodic applications of fertilizer (e.g., May, September and October). Full sun is best in northern climates. In Midwest Transition Area climates such as St. Louis, this grass does best with full sun in the spring and fall, but with part afternoon shade (as from shade trees) in the hot summer months. May brown up and go semi-dormant when temperatures consistently exceed 90 degrees F with periods of drought. Mow regularly to 3"" tall in summer in order to provide some protection for the crowns in hot weather and to 2"" tall in spring and fall. KBG is generally slow to establish and is often sold in blends with other faster growing grasses (e.g., fescues and perennial rye) which provide cover until the blue grass becomes established. For a pure KBG lawn, it is best to mix and sow the seed of 3-5 different KBG cultivars.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 KBG is one of the most widely planted turfgrasses for the northern 1/2 of the United States and is generally considered to be the standard by which cool season grasses are compared. It is a creeping (by rhizomes), fine-textured, cool season turfgrass which features soft, narrow, linear, rich, medium to dark green blades (to 1/8"" wide) and characteristic boat-shaped tips. The network of roots and rhizomes forms a dense sod. A large number of KBG cultivars have been introduced over the years which vary considerably in terms of disease resistance, texture, color, cultural requirements and recommended uses. 'Gnome', 'Baron' and 'Viva' seed were mixed and sown at the Kemper Center KBG demonstration plot in the Ground Cover Border. These three KBG cultivars are reportedly superior to the species. They compliment each other and as blended together provide a dense, dark green, quality turf with good resistance to disease and drought.Genus name comes from the Greek word poa meaning fodder grass.Specific epithet means of the meadows.","Problems
 KBG is susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including dollar spot, leaf spots, stripe smut, powdery mildew and summer patch. Summer patch can be particularly troublesome in the St. Louis area. KBG is subject to attack from a number of insects including root-eating grubs, cutworms, billbugs and sod webworms. When under stress, most cultivars will show diminished resistance to damage from insects, diseases and drought.","Garden Uses

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-10. Needs full sun for best flowering. Set plant roots in spring into mud at the margins of a pond or in containers (rich organic loams) in a water garden under 3-5” of water. Outside of containers, rhizomes can spread rapidly to form colonies under optimum growing conditions. If spread is a concern, grow plants in containers.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pontederia cordata, commonly called pickerel weed, is a vigorous, deciduous, emergent marginal aquatic perennial that typically grows 2-4’ tall. It is native to quiet waters at stream and pond margins from Nova Scotia south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it is typically found growing in sloughs, swamps and ponds scattered in a few counties in the far eastern and far western parts of the State (Steyermark). In the wild, it is frequently seen growing in dense colonies. Glossy, narrow, arrowhead-shaped green leaves (to 10” long) have rounded cordate bases and rise well above the water surface. Tiny, tubular soft blue flowers are densely packed into erect, 3-6” long spikes atop flower stalks typically rising 1-2’ above the water surface. Plants flower freely from June to October. Flowers give way to starchy seeds with distinctive toothed ridges. Flower spikes droop after bloom, releasing the distinctive seeds into the water. Seeds are edible off the plant or can be dried and added to granola cereals. Very young leaves can be used as salad greens. Dragonflies and damselflies commonly lay their eggs on plant stems near the water surface. Fish (albeit more than just pickerel) may seek shelter in clumps of these plants, hence the common name of pickerel weed.Genus name honors Guilio Pontedera (1688-1757), professor of botany at Padua.Specific epithet refers to the rounded cordate bases of the leaves.","Problems

 Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers consistently moist soils, but tolerates some drought. Tolerates a wide range of soils. Suckers to form colonies. Tolerant of many urban pollutants.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Populus alba, commonly called white popular, is primarily grown for the silvery-green hues of its foliage, buds, young twigs and young bark. Native to Europe and Asia, it was first introduced into North America in the mid-1700s. It has been widely planted throughout the U.S., and has escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas, particularly in the East. It is distinguished from other poplars by its 3-5 lobed silvery leaves that are reminiscent of some maples. It is a fast-growing deciduous tree that typically grows 50-75’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with an irregular to broad-rounded crown. Trunk diameters may reach 2-3’. It is often seen growing as a multi-trunked tree, however. Alternate, ovate to rounded, 3-5 lobed leaves (to 5” long) are blue green above and woolly white beneath with coarsely-toothed to wavy margins. As with aspens, the leaves of white poplars tremble in the slightest breeze, showcasing the attractive foliage. Fall color is undistinguished. Bark on young trees is smooth and greenish-gray, but matures to dark gray-black with ridges and furrows. White poplars are dioecious, with tiny reddish male and greenish female flowers appearing in separate catkins on separate male and female trees in spring (April) before the foliage emerges. Flowering catkins are not showy. Flowers in female catkins give way to small dehiscent capsules that typically ripen and split open in late May, distributing abundant cottony-tufted seeds.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means white.","Problems
 Susceptible to a wide range of diseases including dieback, cankers, leaf spots, rusts and powdery mildew. Insect visitors include borers, aphids, caterpillars and scale. Considered an invasive alien in some areas because its abundant self-seeding and rapid growth rate which have enabled it to naturalize and overwhelm some native species.","Garden Uses
 Foliage of healthy trees has very good ornamental interest. Considered an inappropriate selection for streets because shallow roots may buckle sidewalks and damage sewers. Suckering habit and messy tendencies (twigs, leaves, cottony seeds) also raise questions as to appropriateness for lawns.

 Populus deltoides, commonly called eastern cottonwood, is a large, fast-growing, deciduous tree that typically grows 50-80’ (less frequently to 120’) tall with a broad, open-rounded shaped habit. Yellowish twigs, coarsely toothed leaves and gummy end buds distinguish this from the other poplars. It is native from eastern North America through the Great Plains, typically growing along streams and rivers and in lowland areas and swamps. Settlers who pushed westward into the Great Plains in the 1800s sometimes planted eastern cottonwoods along small streams and creeks. Tiny male and female flowers appear in separate catkins on separate male and female trees (dioecious). Flowers bloom in early spring (March-April) before the foliage emerges. Male flowers are reddish but not showy. Female flowers give way to dehiscent capsules that split open when ripe (May in St. Louis), broadcasting abundant densely-tufted seeds. Seeds with silky white hairs give the appearance of cotton as they blow through the air and along the ground, typically collecting along gutters, curbs, roadsides and fences. Bark on mature trees is ridged and dark gray. Triangular, acuminate, coarsely toothed, glossy dark green leaves (to 5” long). Leaves turn yellow in fall. Wood is weak and has little commercial value (warps easily) other than for crates, plywood and pulp.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet is in reference to the triangular or deltoid shape of the leaves.","Problems

 Best grown in rich, humusy, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun. In the wild, this tree grows in a large variety of soils ranging from rocky soils at high mountain elevations to clay or sandy loams at lower elevations. This tree thrives in cool northern climates, but will struggle in the heat and humidity of a typical St. Louis summer. Generally intolerant of urban pollutants. In the wild, aspens typically appear in groupings or groves, with all of the stems in a grouping being clones rising from a single extensive underground root system. Large groves featuring hundreds of clones may have all originated from a single stem. Trees are dioecious, so each grouping consists of all male clones or all female clones.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Populus tremuloides, commonly called quaking aspen, is perhaps most noted for its beautiful white bark, its deep green foliage that quakes in the slightest breeze and its golden yellow fall foliage color. It has the widest geographical distribution of any North American tree, being indigenous to Alaska and most of Canada, the Pacific Northwest, New England, the Great Lakes and south in the Rockies to New Mexico and Arizona. It is a medium sized deciduous tree that typically grows 20-50’ tall with a narrow, rounded crown. Ovate-triangular to nearly round, dark glossy green leaves (to 3” long) are finely toothed. Leaves flutter in even the smallest amount of wind due to flattened leaf stalks. Leaves turn a beautiful golden yellow in fall. Aspens are dioecious, with male and female flowers appearing in separate catkins on separate clones in spring (April in St. Louis) before the foliage. Catkins are gray-green and not showy. Small drooping fruiting clusters follow the female flowers in late May. Bark of young trees is smooth and greenish white. As the tree matures, bark becomes more chalky white with black warty patching.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means resembling the trembling poplar.","Problems
 Aspens are susceptible to a large number of disease problems, including dieback, leaf spots, rusts, powdery mildew and cankers. Diseased trees often suffer premature leaf drop as a result thereof. Common insect visitors include caterpillars, borers, aphids and scale. Trees stressed by St. Louis summers are particularly susceptible to diseases such as dieback and to borers.","Garden Uses

 Prunella grandiflora, commonly known as large-flowered self-heal, is a sprawling, low-growing, mat-forming, semi-evergreen perennial of the mint family that typically grows to 6-12” tall, but spreads by stolons and rhizomes to 18-36” wide. It is native to meadows and woodlands in Europe. Ovate to lanceolate, deep green leaves (4” long) with sparsely toothed margins grow in basal tufts. Tubular, 2-lipped, purple flowers (to 1” long) bloom in summer in terminal flower spikes (to 2-3” long) located atop square, opposite-leaved flowering stems rising to 12” tall.  
 

 This species has a history of use both as a medicinal herb (treatment of a large number of medical ailments including throat inflammations and quinsy) and as a culinary herb (raw, cooked or dried leaves were added to soups, salads or stews).Genus name was used by 15th and 16th century German herbalists.Specific epithet means large-flowered.Common name of self-heal is in reference to one-time medicinal uses for this plant.","Problems

Stark Bro's sells this cultivar grafted to both standard (15-20' tall) and dwarf (8-10' tall) rootstocks. The tree growing at the Kemper Center is grafted to a dwarf rootstock. Dwarf trees bear full-size fruit, but have the advantages of fitting into smaller sites, of being more manageable (easier to prune, spray, harvest) and of often bearing fruit at an earlier age. This cultivar features white flowers in very early spring followed by freestone apricots which ripen in mid July in USDA Zone 5.","Problems
 Apricots in general can be difficult to grow in Missouri because (a) their early blooming flowers (two weeks earlier than peaches) are extremely susceptible to frost injury and (2) insects/diseases. Potential disease problems include brown rot, root rot and bacterial leaf spot. Potential insect pests include plum curculio, borers and aphids. Mites can also be a problem. Although good sanitation practices are always essential, chemical spraying is usually necessary in order to adequately control pests.","Garden Uses

 Prunus avium is generally grown as an ornamental cherry tree. It is native to Europe and Asia and has been cultivated in the U.S. since colonial times. Although it is a parent of many of the sweet cherry cultivars sold in commerce today for fruit production (such as the popular bing cherry), its fruits are smaller and not as sweet or tasty as the cultivars. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows 20-30’ tall in cultivation, but may reach 60’ in its native habitat. Fragrant white flowers (to 1.5” diameter) appear singly or in 3-5 flowered clusters in spring slightly before the foliage emerges. Flowers are followed by small sweet red to black cherries which ripen in early summer. Oval, dull, dark green leaves (to 6” long) turn yellow in fall. Birds and squirrels love the fruit, and are undoubtedly in part responsible for the naturalization of this tree from gardens into the wild in eastern and midwestern North America. Also commonly called mazzard cherry.Genus name from Latin means plum or cherry tree.Specific epithet is from the Latin word for bird.","Problems
 Potential disease problems include leaf spot, bacterial canker, brown rot, black knot, crown gall, leaf curl, leaf scorch, powdery mildew, root rot, scab and shot-hole fungus. Potential insect pests include aphids, fruit flies, saw flies and scale. Netting or nylon mesh can be used, if necessary, to prevent birds from stealing the crop.

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where it is best grown in deep, fertile, well-drained loams in full sun. Best flowering and fruiting is in full sun. Grows well in sandy soils. Avoid heavy clays. This tree grows best in areas such as the State of California where it can be sited in hot, dry locations with low humidity such as the interior valleys and can enjoy a long growing season. Although trees in protected locations may survive St. Louis winters, they generally will not produce a nut crop because of a short growing season combined with risk of late spring frost or early fall frost.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Prunus dulcis, commonly called almond, is primarily native to western Asia (Pakistan to the eastern Mediterranean) but today is grown throughout the world. Almond trees are commercially grown for their edible nuts which not only may be eaten raw or toasted, but also are widely used in a variety of prepared foods, bakery products, candies, desserts and oils. Marzipan is made from almond paste. This is a dense, rounded, deciduous tree or large multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 10-15’ (less frequently to 30') tall and as wide. Trees are much like the peach, however the almond is self-incompatible and two or more cultivars are needed for best cross pollination. Honey bees are adept pollinators. Fragrant, 5-petaled, light pink to white flowers appear singly or in pairs in an early spring bloom before the leaves emerge. Flowers are borne laterally on spurs or on short lateral branches. Flowers are followed by the fruit which is an oblong drupe. The drupe matures about 7-8 months after the flowers appear with the hull splitting open at that time to reveal the stone/nut inside. Lanceolate to oblong lanceolate, serrate, green leaves (to 5"" long). Non-showy yellow green fall color. Almond is the name of both the tree and the edible nut. Around 40% of the world commercial almond crop currently comes from the U.S., with most of that coming from California.Genus name from Latin means plum or cherry tree.Specific epithet means sweet.","Problems
 Early spring flowers are susceptible to damage from frosts. Almond is susceptible to a large number of insect and disease problems.

Plant in full sun in a site where periodic chemical spraying will not pose any problems to adjacent sites. Avoid planting nectarine trees in the same soil where other stone fruits have recently grown. Dwarf trees may be planted as close as 10' apart.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Prunus persica, commonly called peach, is native to China. It is grown for its luscious fruit but some cultivars are grown chiefly for there flowers and produce inedible fruit. Species trees grow up to 25' tall and wide but peach trees sold in commerce today are grafted to rootstocks which control the size of the tree. Dwarf trees bear standard size fruit, but have the advantage of fitting into smaller sites and being more manageable (easier pruning, spraying and harvesting).
 

 Var. nectarina, commonly called nectarine, is basically a smooth-skinned peach. Nectarine trees sold in commerce today are also grafted to rootstocks which controls the size of the tree.Genus name from Latin means plum or cherry tree.Specific epithet means Persia. Prunus persica reached Europe from China through Persia.'Mericrest' produces soft pink blossoms in early spring are followed by medium to large freestone nectarines with bright yellow flesh and fuzzless, yellow skin blushed with red. Fruit ripens in early to mid August (USDA Zone 5). Dwarf trees produce standard-sized fruit, but have the obvious advantages of fitting into smaller sites and being more manageable (i.e., easier pruning, spraying and harvesting). The tree growing at the Kemper Center was grafted to a dwarf rootstock which results in a very small tree typically growing to only 8-10' tall. 'Mericrest' is also available in commerce as a standard-sized tree (grafted to a standard rootstock) which typically grows 12-15' tall.","Problems
 Nectarines are susceptible to a large number of serious pest problems. A regular regimen of chemical spraying is needed in order to insure harvesting a good crop. Potential disease problems include peach leaf curl, brown rot, bacterial leaf spot and canker. Potential insect problems include peach tree borer, plum curculio, oriental fruit moth, root nematodes, mites and aphids. Very cold winter temperatures and late spring frosts often cause significant damage to the buds/flowers of nectarines.'Mericrest' is noted for its cold hardiness.","Garden Uses

 Prunus virginiana, commonly called chokecherry, is primarily native from Newfoundland to Saskatchewan south to North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri and Kansas. In Missouri, it most frequently occurs on wooded slopes, bluffs and ravines in areas north of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Chokecherry is a small deciduous tree typically growing to 20-30’ tall with an irregular, oval-rounded crown. It also may be found in shorter heights as a large shrub. Fragrant, cup-shaped, 5-lobed, white flowers (each to 1/2” across) in elongated clusters to 3-6” long bloom in mid-spring. Flowers give way to clusters of globular, pea-sized berries that ripen to dark purple/black in August. Fruits are technically edible, but are astringent (hence the common name) and should not be eaten off the tree. Fruits can be harvested for processing into jams, jellies, pies and sauces. Fruits are very attractive to many birds and animals. Elliptic to obovate leaves (to 5” long) with sharply toothed margins are dark green above and gray-green beneath. Fall color is golden yellow to orange. This tree is also commonly called Virginia bird cherry. Although common in the wild in many parts of the U.S., this species is infrequently sold in commerce.

 Pseudotsuga menziesii, commonly called Douglas fir, is a very large conifer that grows 50-80' tall in cultivation, but to 300+' tall in the wild. Unique forked cone bracts distinguish this tree from all other conifers. The species is indigenous to coastal areas and up to 5500' in elevation in the mountains from British Columbia south to central California. Cones (to 4.5"" long) are pendulous with protruding trident-shaped bracts. Flat, linear, spirally-arranged, dark green needles (to 1.5"" long) with white banding beneath. Fallen or plucked needles leave raised circular leaf scars on the twigs. Needles are fragrant when bruised. Narrow pyramidal shape with branching to the ground when young. Trees become more cylindrical with age as they lose their lower branching, with older trees typically having branching only on the top 1/3 of the tree. This is an important timber tree in the Pacific Northwest. Pseduotsuga menziesii var. glauca is the Rocky Mountain variety of this tree. It grows at higher elevations (to 9500') with a slower growth rate, and has shorter cones (to 3""), blue-green needles and better winter hardiness. Var. glauca is the commonly cultivated variety of this tree for areas outside of the Pacific Northwest, and is clearly a better selection for midwestern climates than the species because of its better cold tolerance (species is hardy to USDA Zone 6, but var. glauca is hardy to Zone 4). Synonymous with and sometimes called Pseudotsuga taxifolia.Genus name comes from the Greek words pseudo meaning false and Tsuga meaning hemlock.Specific epithet honors Scottish naval surgeon and botanist Archibald Menzies (1754-1842).","Problems

 Pulsatilla vulgaris is a purple-flowered pasque flower that is native to Europe (Great Britain and France to the Ukraine). Hairy flower stems emerge from the ground in spring (March-April in St. Louis), sometimes when patches of snow are still on the ground. Flowers bloom as the foliage begins to form. Flowers are solitary, erect-to-nodding and open-bell-shaped. When the flowers appear, stems are typically only 4-5” tall. Stems elongate and foliage grows taller after bloom, with plants typically maturing to 9-12” tall. Flowers are followed by equally-ornamental, plume-like seedheads (reminiscent of some clematis) in fluffy spherical clusters. Deeply-divided, silky, hairy, fern-like, light green, basal leaves (to 4-6"" long) are attractive throughout the growing season.

 Punica granatum, commonly called pomegranate, is a multi-stemmed deciduous (evergreen in tropical areas) shrub or small tree that grows to 6-20’ (less frequently to 30’) tall. It has long been cultivated for its orange-sized edible fruit and its attractive ornamental plant features. It is native from southern Europe to northern India, but has naturalized over time around the Mediterranean and in a number of additional warm weather climates throughout the world including parts of the southeastern and southwestern U. S. In proper growing conditions, trumpet-shaped, orange-red flowers (to 1 1/4” wide) bloom throughout the summer singly or in clusters at the branch ends. Flowers give way to orange-sized, leathery-skinned, globose fruits (pomegranates to 2-4” diameter) that ripen to yellow tinged with red. Fruit interior is divided into compartments packed with fleshy, juicy, edible sacs (arils) that surround the seeds. The juicy sacs (along with the seed inside each) are edible fresh or may be incorporated into jams or jellies. Grenadine is a syrup (concentrated juice) that is used to flavor drinks. Narrow, pointed, oblong-lanceolate, glossy green leaves (to 4” long) are opposite or in whorls. In fall, foliage turns yellow in non-tropical areas.Genus name comes from the Latin name contracted from punicum malum, the Carthaginian apple, in turn derived from Poenus, Carthaginians, Phoinikes, Phoenicians.Specific epithet means many seeded.Pomegranate comes from the Latin words pomium meaning apple.Species plants generally do not perform well as indoor plants. ‘Nana’ is a compact/dwarf form that may perform well in a sunny window, and is considered to be a much better alternative for indoor use. ‘Nana’ grows to only 3’ tall with scarlet flowers and 2-inch fruits.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems. Species plants require dry, somewhat arid conditions with temperatures in the mid 90s in order to produce fruit.

 Easily grown in fertile, moist to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants are less drought tolerant than most of the other species of Pycnanthemum. Performs well in bright shade, but best flowering often occurs in full sun. This plant is a vigorous grower that may spread by rhizomes in optimum conditions, but it is not invasive as are many of the true mints (Mentha). If naturalizing is unwanted, prune roots in spring with a spade to keep clumps from spreading. Propagate by seed or division.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pycnanthemum muticum, commonly called mountain mint or short-toothed mountain mint or clustered mountain mint, is a clump-forming aromatic perennial that typically grows 1-3’ tall. It is native to Eastern North America (Maine to Michigan to Illinois and Missouri south to Florida and Texas) where it typically grows in grassy open places, meadows, fields, low woodland areas and occasionally in dry upland woods, but not in alpine areas as somewhat inaccurately suggested by its common name. In Missouri, it is only found in the far southeastern corner of the State. 
 

 This densely leaved mountain mint features dark green leaves which have a strong mint-like (spearmint) aroma when crushed. Branched stems (mostly square in cross section) are clad with nearly sessile, ovate to ovate-lanceolate, acuminate (pointed), dark green leaves (to 2 1/4"" long) with round to heart-shaped bases and toothed margins. Plant foliage is topped in mid to late summer by a bloom of two-lipped tubular pink flowers (each to 1/2"" wide) in dense flat-topped terminal (sometimes axillary) clusters, with each cluster being subtended and highlighted by a pair of unique and showy silvery fringeless leaf-like bracts located near the base of the cluster. When planted in groups or massed, the silvery bracts give the entire planting the appearance of being dusted by a white powdery snow. Flowers are attractive to butterflies and bees. 
  
 Leaves can be used to make mild tea. Native Americans used this plant for treatment of fevers, colds, stomach aches, and other minor physical ailments.Genus name comes from Greek pyknos meaning dense and anthos meaning flower for its densely packed flowers.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word muticus meaning blunt.","Problems

 Pseudogynoxys chenopodioides commonly called Mexican flame vine, is a smooth-stemmed vine that features alternate arrowhead-shaped evergreen leaves and a late spring-to-fall bloom of orange daisy-like flowers. It is native to Mexico. Flowers (each to 1"" diameter) appear in clusters. Orange flower color gradually ages to red. Flowers are followed by small dandelion-like puffs of seed. Evergreen leaves (to 4"" long) are deep green with serrated edges. Where winter hardy, this vine will grow to 12' (less frequently to 20') long.  As an annual it will grow smaller. Flowers are attractive to butterflies and bees. Synonymous with and formerly known as Senecio confusus.","Problems
 No serious insect or disease problems.","Garden Uses

 Quercus alba, commonly called white oak, is a large deciduous Missouri native tree of the white oak group. It typically occurs in dry upland slopes and ledges as well as lowland valleys and ravines throughout the State. Grows to 50-80' tall in cultivation and taller (to 100') in the wild. Pyramidal when young, but matures into a substantial tree with a wide-spreading, rounded crown. Insignificant yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring shortly after the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 3/4"" long) with warty-scaled cups. Leaves (4-9"" long) have 7 to 9 deep rounded lobes. Leaves emerge pinkish in spring, but mature to dark green. Variable fall color ranges from uninteresting browns to quality shades of dark red. White oak grows over much of eastern North America and is an important hardwood timber tree. Widely used in landscapes, but slow growth rate and large size has somewhat tempered its popularity.

 Easily grown in average, acidic, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers consistent moisture throughout the growing season, but tolerates dry soils.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Quercus ellipsoidalis, commonly called northern pin oak, hill’s oak or jack oak, is a medium-sized deciduous oak of the red oak group that typically grows 50-70’ tall with a cylindrical shape and rounded crown. Upper branches are ascending, but lower branches descend toward the ground. In the wild, the lower branches are often shaded by other trees, with some branches eventually dying and breaking off leaving persistent pin-like stubs, hence the pin oak part of the common name. This tree is primarily native to dry sandy sites including dry upland woods from northern Missouri to northwestern Ohio north into southern Canada (Manitoba and Ontario). Elliptic dark green leaves (3-7” long) have 5-9 deeply incised, bristle-tipped lobes. Leaves turn a relatively non-showy russet red in fall. Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are elliptic acorns (to 3/4” long), with saucer-shaped acorn cups that cover 1/3 to 1/ 2 of the acorn. Acorns mature at the end of two seasons. Acorns are an important food source for wildlife (e.g., deer, bears, squirrels, small rodents and some birds). Smooth gray-black to dark brown bark usually develops ridging with age. Trunks mature over time to a diameter to 3’. Northern pin oak is similar in appearance to pin oak (Quercus palustris). Pin oak is primarily a lowland tree that is native to areas south of the more upland northern pin oak. One distinguishing difference is that the acorns of northern pin oak are narrower and longer than those of pin oak.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet is in reference to ellipsoidal acorns.","Problems
 Chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) is common in alkaline soils and can severely damage this tree. Northern pin oak is otherwise infrequently attacked by the common diseases of oaks which include oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew.

 Quercus nigra, commonly called Water oak or possum oak, is a medium sized deciduous (sometimes semi-evergreen in southern areas) oak of the red oak group that typically grows in a conical form to 50-80’ tall with a broad rounded crown. Trunk diameter extends to 3.5’. Brownish gray bark becomes grayish black with age with rough scaly ridging. Water oak is native primarily from New Jersey to Florida and Texas, extending northward along the Mississippi River valley to western Kentucky, southern Illinois and the Missouri bootheel. It is typically found in low woodland areas, floodplains and along streams and rivers. Insignificant monoecious flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring. Fruits are broad-rounded acorns (to 1/2” long) in short-stalked cups with woolly scales. Acorns are a source of food for wildlife. Narrow, smooth-margined, spatula-shaped, oblong leaves (2-4” long and 1-2” wide) are three-lobed to entire at the tips. Leaves are dull bluish-green above and paler with pubescence beneath. Old leaves tend to drop in late fall to early winter, but may persist on the tree throughout most of the winter in the southern parts of the growing range (particularly within USDA Zones 8-9).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet means black.","Problems
 Water oak is a weak-wooded tree that is susceptible to trunk cankers and rots, all of which makes in vulnerable to limb breakage from wind and winter snow/ice. Oaks in general are susceptible to a large number of diseases, including oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew.

 Easily grown in average, medium to wet, acidic soils in full sun. Prefers moist loams. Tolerates poorly drained soils. Tolerates some flooding. May take up to 15-20 years for this tree to bear a first crop of acorns.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Quercus palustris commonly called pin oak is a medium sized deciduous oak of the red oak group that typically grows 50-70’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a broad pyramidal crown. Upper branches are ascending, middle branches are somewhat horizontal and lower branches are descending. In the wild, the lower branches of this tree are often shaded by other trees, eventually dying and breaking off leaving persistent pin-like stubs, hence the common name. Trunk diameter to 3’. Smooth gray-brown bark usually develops ridging with age. This is a tree of lowlands and bottomlands that is primarily native to the Midwest and mid-Atlantic States. In Missouri, it typically occurs in valleys, floodplains and stream margins, but is infrequently found in drier upland areas (Steyermark). Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are rounded acorns (to 1/2” long), with shallow, saucer-shaped acorn cups that barely cover the acorn base. Acorns are an important source of food for wildlife. Glossy, dark green leaves (to 5” long) typically have 5 bristle-tipped lobes with deeply cut sinuses extending close to the midrib. Leaves turn deep red in fall. Pin oak is pehaps the most popular commercial oak of eastern North America, having been widely planted as both a street and a landscape tree.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word for marsh (palus), in reference to a common habitat for this tree.","Problems
 Chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) is common in alkaline soils and can severely damage this tree. Pin oak is otherwise infrequently attacked by the common diseases of oaks which include oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew. Potential insect pests include scale, oak skeletonizer, leaf miner, galls, oak lace bugs, borers, caterpillars and nut weevils.

 Ravenala madagascariensis, commonly called traveller's tree or traveller's palm, is a large tree-like plant which is native to moist forests in Madagascar where it will grow over time to 30-50' tall. It has now been planted in frost free areas around the world, including far southern Florida into the Keys, southern Texas, southern California and Hawaii. This plant features an unbranched trunk (to 12"" diameter) which is topped by a fan-shaped single plane of enormous, long-stalked, banana-like, deep green leaves (20-30 per trunk). Each leaf blade is 5-10' long by 2-3' wide and appears at the end of a thick, grooved leaf stalk (petiole) which is as long or longer than the leaf blade. Leaf margins are sometimes split as is the case with some bananas. Up to one quart of rain water will accumulate in the expanded and cupped base of each leaf stalk, thus giving rise to the common names for this plant which suggests an emergency drinking water source for travellers in need. Showy 3-petaled white flowers in cymes rise from boat-shaped spathes in a manner reminiscent of this plant's bird-of-paradise (Strelitzia) relative. Flowers bloom in summer plus sporadically throughout the rest of the year. Flowers are followed by woody capsules (to 3 1/2"" long) containing edible seeds covered by bright blue arils. In early years, the trunk of this plant is subterranean (not visible), with the fan of leaves sitting on the ground.  Eventually the trunk does appear and lengthen, with somewhat attractive leaf scar rings forming on the trunk surface as the lower leaves drop.Genus name comes from the native name in Madagascar.Specific epithet means of Madagascar.","Problems

 Rhapidophyllum hystrix, commonly called needle palm, is a shrubby, clumping, nearly trunkless, fan palm that grows to 3-6’ tall and as wide. It is native to moist to wet woodlands, slopes, ravines and stream bottomland in the southeastern U. S. (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi). It is one of the hardiest if not the hardiest of the palms. It is noted for its large, palmate, glossy green leaves that grow on long upright petioles (to 30” long). Each deeply divided leaf (almost to the base) is fan-shaped (to 30 inches across) with 5-12 narrow segments (each to 20” long). Leaves are evergreen. The common name of needle palm are both in reference to the long, stiff, sharply-pointed, needle-like, black spines (to 6” long) that project from the leaf sheaths. Spines make the clumps impenetrable to most wildlife. Three-petaled, yellow-brown flowers in small dense clusters bloom in early summer among the leaf sheaths.

 Rhus aromatica, commonly called fragrant sumac, is a deciduous Missouri native shrub which occurs in open woods, glades and thickets throughout the State. A dense, low-growing, rambling shrub which spreads by root suckers to form thickets in the wild. Typically grows 2-4' tall (less frequently to 6') and spreads to 10' wide. Trifoliate, medium green leaves turn attractive shades of orange, red and purple in autumn. Leaves and twigs are aromatic when bruised (hence the species name). Although smaller, the leaves resemble in appearance those of the related poison ivy (Rhus radicans). However fragrant sumac is a totally non-poisonous plant. Tiny yellow flowers bloom at the twig tips in early spring before the foliage. Separate male flowers (in catkins) and female flowers (in clusters) appear on the same plants (monoecious) or, more commonly, on different plants (dioecious). Male catkins form in late summer and persist throughout the winter until eventually blooming in spring. Female flowers give way in late summer to small clusters of hairy, red berries which may persist into winter.

 Rudbeckia triloba, commonly called brown-eyed Susan, is a coarse, weedy, somewhat hairy, clump-forming, densely-branched biennial or short-lived perennial that is native from New England to Minnesota south to Georgia and Oklahoma. In Missouri, it typically occurs in wet woods along streams, alluvial thickets, rocky slopes at the base of bluffs and along roadsides throughout the state except for the far southeastern corner (Steyermark). This is a densely-branched plant that typically grows to 2-3’ (less frequently to 5’) tall. Daisy-like flowers (to 1 1/2” diameter) featuring 6-12 yellow rays and brown-purple center disks bloom profusely from summer to fall. Leaves are thin and rough-textured on both sides. Some of the leaves are 3-lobed (less frequently 5- or 7-lobed). Lower leaves are ovate to ovate-cordate with long petioles, and upper leaves are less rounded and sessile. Other common names for this plant include thin-leaved coneflower (for thin leaves) and three-lobed coneflower (for three-lobed leaves and species name). This plant is in part distinguished from black-eyed Susan (R. hirta) by having a more profuse bloom of smaller flowers that usually have fewer rays per flowerhead.Genus name honors Olof Rudbeck (1630-1702) Swedish botanist and founder of the Uppsala Botanic Garden in Sweden where Carl Linnaeus was professor of botany.Specific epithet means three-lobed.","Problems

 Rumex sanguineus, known by a number of different common names including bloody dock or red-veined dock, is a tap-rooted rosette-forming perennial of the buckwheat family that typically grows in a rounded foliage clump to 18” tall and as wide. It is native to ditches, clearings and forests in Europe and Asia, but has over time escaped gardens and naturalized in certain areas of the U. S. and Canada. It is primarily grown as a decorative foliage accent to showcase its oblong to lance-shaped medium green leaves (to 6” long) which are prominently veined with contrasting red to purple. It is also sometimes grown in vegetable/herb gardens for harvest of its edible young leaves. In early summer, tiny star-shaped flowers appear in panicles atop reddish-tinged stems growing to 30” tall. Flowers emerge green, but mature to reddish brown. Flowers are followed by reddish-brown fruit.  
 

 In addition to its ornamental virtues, the young leaves of this plant are edible and add interesting color and a spinach-like taste to salads. Some people may experience mild stomach upset after ingesting the leaves however. Other species of this genus are generally regarded as much better culinary plants.

This species may not be reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area, and is best grown in the southern parts of the U.S.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Salix babylonica, commonly called weeping willow or Babylon weeping willow, is a medium to large deciduous tree with a stout trunk topped by a graceful broad-rounded crown of branches that sweep downward to the ground. It grows to 30-50’ (sometimes to 60’) tall and as wide. It is native to China.  
 

 Many consider this tree to have the best form of the weeping willows available in commerce. Bark is gray-black. Branchlets are typically green or brown. This weeping willow can be a spectacular specimen at the edge of a pond with its branches gracefully weeping down to touch the water, however, it is often very difficult to site this tree in a residential landscape. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers appearing in silvery green catkins (to 1” long) on separate male and female trees. Flowering catkins appear in April-May, but are not showy. Narrow, lanceolate, finely-toothed leaves (to 6” long and 3/4” wide) with long acuminate apices are light green above and gray-green beneath. Variable fall color is usually an undistinguished greenish-yellow.  
 

 Some experts believe that the true species no longer exists in the wild in China and that plants being sold today under the name S. babylonica are primarily hybrids or mistakenly identified similar species.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.The specific epithet means of Babylon and was given to this tree by Carl Linnaeus who mistakenly believed it to be the biblical willow of Babylon instead of a tree from China that was likely transported westward beginning in biblical times along the Silk Road trade route from China through central Asia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, eventually finding its way into Europe by the early 1700s. The trees growing in Babylon along the Euphrates River in biblical times were probably poplars (Populus euphratica) which are not willows but are in the willow family.","Problems
 Susceptible to numerous disease problems including blights, powdery mildew, leaf spots and cankers. It also is visited by many insect pests including aphids, scale, borers, lacebugs and caterpillars. Wood is weak and tends to crack. Branches may be damaged by ice and snow. Litter from leaves, twigs and branches may be a problem. Shallow roots may clog sewers or drains and make gardening underneath the trees difficult.","Garden Uses
 Weeping form of this tree is quite beautiful when the tree is planted in appropriate settings. Weeping willow may be grown most effectively in moist soils along streams, ponds or other water bodies. It is generally not recommended for use as a specimen in residential landscapes because of its susceptibility to breakage, potential insect/disease problems, invasive roots which seek out cracks in sewer and water pipes, litter potential, and overall mature size (this can develop into a very large tree).",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers moist, light, gravelly or sandy soils with good drainage. Tolerates drought. Avoid wet soils in winter. This sage is a biennial or short-lived perennial. When grown from seed, it produces downy, wrinkled, silver-gray rosettes of foliage the first year with flowering stems rising above foliage in the second year. Flowering stems may be promptly cut off as they appear to showcase the plant foliage and to encourage perennial tendencies. Plants that flower and seed in the second year complete their biennial course and disappear from the garden. Some gardeners prefer to let plants bloom for enjoyment of the flowers. Plants may continue in the garden from year to year, albeit in slightly different locations, by self-seeding. Plant foliage tends to struggle and decline as summer progresses in hot and humid conditions south of USDA Zone 7a. This plant is often grown as an annual. Propagate by seed or removal of rooted lateral offshoots in spring.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Salvia argentea, commonly called silver sage, is a clump-forming biennial or short-lived perennial that is native to the Mediterranean area (southern Europe to northern Africa). Unlike most salvias, plants of this species are grown primarily for their large, woolly leaves and not for their flowers. In the first year, this sage features a large rosette of soft, felt-like, broad-oval, downy, wrinkled, silver-gray leaves (to 8"" long by 6"" wide) that form an attractive foliage mound to 12"" tall and to 20"" wide. Leaves emerge silver-white in spring but gradually mature to silver-gray to greenish-gray as the summer progresses. In the second year, silver flower spikes rise well above the foliage to 2-3' tall, topped with tubular, hooded, white flowers that are tinged with pink. Flowers bloom in early summer.The genus name Salvia comes from the Latin word salveo meaning ""to save or heal"", in reference to the purported medically curative properties attributed to some plants in the genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word argentum meaning silver in reference to the young leaves that emerge silver-white in spring.","Problems

 Strict adherence to the cultural needs of this plant is essential. In residential areas, plants are best grown in the consistently moist soils of a bog garden. The bog garden should be prepared in advance of planting. In the St. Louis area, the bog garden should be sited in a protected location with winter mulch. If a bog garden is not available, then growing plants in containers may be the next best option. Plants require full sun. In part shade, leaf coloring does not develop as it should and pitchers droop. Plants need an acidic, humusy muck that is constantly damp but not watery. Soils must never dry out, but plant crowns should not sit in water. Soil recommendations include Canadian peat or various mixes of peat/sand or peat/perlite. Irrigation hoses and underground liners should be considered. Plants flower in spring, produce new pitchers in spring-summer and the pitchers mostly die back as winter approaches. In cold climates, trim leaves back in winter as pitchers die, but only trim dead tissue. Soil may be mulched with pine needles in winter to protect plants from cold temperatures. Most reproduction comes from continuous budding along the rhizome as opposed to self-seeding. Easiest propagation is by rhizome division. Plants may be grown from seed with effort, but will not flower for the first 4-5 years. Plants may also be grown in pots/containers (plastic best) placed outside on a sunny deck or patio area. Container soils can be 50% peat and 50% perlite/vermiculite. Potting soil and/or fertilizer may kill the plant. Containers should be placed in a tray of water that keeps the soil constantly moist. Containers may be overwintered by inserting them to the rim in soil in protected locations. Dig up containers in spring to place back in full sun areas. Containers may also be brought inside in winter with somewhat reduced watering. Plants need full sun in the growing season and cold temperatures for winter dormancy, hence they often do not grow well as houseplants. Do not collect these plants from the wild.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Sarracenia purpurea is native to eastern North America. Sarracenia purpurea subsp. purpurea (northern version) is found from Minnesota through the Great Lakes to Newfoundland and south along the Atlantic Coast to the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Sarracenia purpurea subsp. venosa (southern version) is found primarily on the coastal plain from the New Jersey Pine Barrens south to Georgia and west from the Florida panhandle to Louisiana. This southern version is a stemless herbaceous perennial that grows in the peaty soils of savannas and upland swamp margins usually in full sun. The northern version is more apt to be found in bogs and fens. Modified leaves form reclining to almost horizontal pitchers (4-12” long) with upward faced open ends. Pitchers (usually less than 8 per plant) are decumbent in this species and relax in a basal rosette-like fashion. Pitcher color is quite variable, but usually green with purple-burgundy near the flared lip. Insects are lured to the pitchers by the attractive leaf colors and nectar. Downward pointing hairs on the inside near the lip prevent trapped insects from escaping. Insects eventually slide down a smooth walled area into a water pool (mostly rain water with some added plant enzymes) at the pitcher bottom where they will drown. Insects decompose and nutrients are absorbed. Unusable parts of insect carasses accumulate in the bottom stalk over time. In spring, a single flower rises on a leafless stalk well above the leaves to 8-15” tall. Flower stalks are crooked at the top, and the globular, 5-petaled, purplish-red to red flower (to 2” diameter) hangs down. Flowers may be mildly aromatic. Each flower is followed by a 5-parted seed capsule. New pitcher leaves appear in spring and summer replacing old leaves that die and fall off. Plants in the genus Sarracenia have a large number of common names, including purple pitcher plant, flytrap, side-saddle plant, huntsman’s cup, frog’s britches and whippoorwill-boots. This species of pitcher plant is distinguished from most other species by that fact that it is a compact plant with decumbent pitchers that are open to the sky (they have vertical hoods), thus each pitcher collects rainwater in which trapped insects are killed by drowning in the rainwater/enzyme mixture located at the base of each pitcher.Genus name honors Dr. Michael Sarrasin de l’Etang of Quebec who reportedly sent the first pitcher plants to Europe around 1700.Specific epithet means purple.Pitcher plants are described as carnivorous plants because they trap and kill insects (e.g., flies, wasps, ants) and similar prey (e.g., mites, spiders) by luring them into trumpet-shaped pitchers (modified leaves) where the insects become trapped and die. Nutrients from the decayed pest bodies are absorbed by the plant as nourishment through special cells located at the base of each pitcher.","Problems
 Plants will do poorly if specific cultural requirements are not followed. Protect from strong freezing winds. Winter hardiness is generally not a problem in the St. Louis area for this plant. Feeding plants manually is not advisable. Do not fertilize plantings. Watch for aphids, scale, mealybugs, moth larvae, leaf spot and root rot.","Garden Uses
 Bog garden is best. Also may be grown in containers, terraria (indoors under grow lights), greenhouses or as an indoor houseplant. Growth in containers as an indoor plant can be difficult because of the need for growing season sun and winter dormancy.

 Saururus cernuus, commonly called Lizard’s tail or water-dragon, is a rhizomatous, deciduous, marginal aquatic perennial that typically grows to 2-4’ tall in the wild. In cultivation in water gardens, it more typically grows 12-24” tall. It is native to Ontario, Quebec and southern New England south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it is commonly found in swampy woods, sloughs, spring branches and slow-moving streams south of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Features heart-shaped leaves (3-6” long) on erect, branching, somewhat zig-zag stems and tiny fragrant white flowers packed into slender, tapered, spike-like racemes (4-12” long) that droop at the tips. Blooms June to September. The flowers give way to small green warty fruits. The nodding flower/fruit spikes purportedly resemble lizards’ tails, hence the common name. The flowers, leaves and roots of this plant have a generally pleasant citrus aroma.Genus name comes from the Greek words sauros meaning a lizard and oura meaning a tail from the dense spicate inflorescence.Specific epithet means drooping or nodding.","Problems

 Sedum pulchellum, commonly called widow's cross, is a stonecrop with ascending to spreading pink to light green stems that typically rise to 4-12"" tall. It is native to rocky limestone outcrops, ledges and glades from Georgia and Kentucky west to Kansas and eastern Texas. In Missouri, it is primarily found in the western Ozarks and unglaciated prairie sections in the southwestern 1/4 of the State. Alternate, smooth, stem-clasping, cylindrical, pale green to lime green leaves (to 1"" long) are densely arranged along the stem.  Stem is topped by a horizontally branched cyme of tiny flowers which bloom in May-June. Each flower (to 1/2"" across) has 4 pink petals, 4 green sepals, 4 pistils and 8 stamens. Flowers are followed by dehiscent seed pods which develop in June and July. Plants brown up and drop leaves as summer progresses, with the seed pods ripening to brown by fall before splitting open to release their seed.Genus name comes from the Latin word sedeo meaning to sit in reference to the general growing habit of many of the sedums (they sit and sprawl over rocks).Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pulchellus meaning beautiful in reference to the flowers.Plants in the genus Sedum are commonly called stonecrops because they are typically found in the wild growing on rocky or stony areas.

Also tolerates moist (not wet) soils with good drainage. Plants freely self-seed. This sedum most commonly grows as an annual with seeds germinating in fall or early spring. Plants can live for more than one year. Steyermark describes the plants native to the southwestern part of Missouri as being winter annuals.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Sedum pulchellum, commonly called widow's cross, is a stonecrop with ascending to spreading pink to light green stems that typically rise to 4-12"" tall. It is native to rocky limestone outcrops, ledges and glades from Georgia and Kentucky west to Kansas and eastern Texas. In Missouri, it is primarily found in the western Ozarks and unglaciated prairie sections in the southwestern 1/4 of the State. Alternate, smooth, stem-clasping, cylindrical, pale green to lime green leaves (to 1"" long) are densely arranged along the stem.  Stem is topped by a horizontally branched cyme of tiny flowers which bloom in May-June. Each flower (to 1/2"" across) has 4 pink petals, 4 green sepals, 4 pistils and 8 stamens. Flowers are followed by dehiscent seed pods which develop in June and July. Plants brown up and drop leaves as summer progresses, with the seed pods ripening to brown by fall before splitting open to release their seed.Genus name comes from the Latin word sedeo meaning to sit in reference to the general growing habit of many of the sedums (they sit and sprawl over rocks).Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pulchellus meaning beautiful in reference to the flowers.Plants in the genus Sedum are commonly called stonecrops because they are typically found in the wild growing on rocky or stony areas. 
 

 Common name of widow's cross is in reference to the four flower petals of each flower which are arranged in the pattern of a cross.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9. May not be grown in the St. Louis area. Where it may be grown, it is best in moist, rich, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Grows best in cool, moist, coastal climates with consistently high moisture levels. Tolerant of wet soils. Intolerant of dry soils. Generally intolerant of temperature extremes. Although technically winter hardy to the deep South, it does not grow well there.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Sequoia sempervirens, called coast redwood, is so named because it is native to moist, foggy, coastal plain areas along the Pacific coast, now being primarily confined to a narrow coastal belt (to 20 miles inland) extending from southern Oregon south to the San Francisco Bay area. This is a narrow-conical, evergreen conifer that is typically found, sometimes in magnificent pure strands, in high moisture coastal areas that are regularly blanketed with fog rolling in from the Pacific. In this native habitat, it is a magnificent, long-lived tree that is generally considered to be the tallest tree in the world, growing to 350’ with a trunk diameter of 20-25’. Although fast-growing in its native habitat, it still may take 400+ years for a redwood to reach maturity. But, it can live to 2000 years or more. In cultivation outside of its native habitat, it will grow much smaller, typically to 60-90’ tall. Coast redwood features flat, bright green needles (to 1” long), oblong seed cones to 1.25” long and furrowed, reddish-brown bark on a straight trunk that is flared outward at the base. This is a prized lumber tree for its rot-resistant wood that is straight-grained and knot-free. Many trees have been protected in areas such as Redwood National Park, Muir Woods and a number of California State Parks. 
 

 Sequoia sempervirens along with its close cousin Sequoiadendron gigantea (giant sequoia) are jointly designated as the State Tree of California.Genus name honors George Gist (1770-1843) born to a German-American merchant and an American Indian girl and was known as Sequoia or Sequioish. He was the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet.Specific epithet means ever green.","Problems

 Sequoiadendron giganteum, known as giant sequoia, has the most massive size of any tree in the world. It is an erect, single-trunk (often buttressed at the base), needled evergreen conifer that is native to groves scattered through montane coniferous forests along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains (4500-8000 feet in elevation) in central California. In its native California habitat, mature trees will often grow to 200-275’ tall, produce trunk diameters ranging from 15-20’ and weigh 200 or more tons. Trees may live 2000-3000 years. Young trees have a pyramidal-oval shape. As trees mature, they begin to lose branches from the lower part of the trunk. Trees generally feature attractive dark cinnamon-brown bark (with deep furrows and ridges), small, scale-like, appressed, blue green needles and fruiting cones to 2.5” long. Trees may be planted in the eastern U.S., but typically will grow to only 40-60’ tall. Giant sequoia was originally discovered in 1833 by Zenas Leonard. A very large percentage of giant sequoias in California are now protected in parks, including Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Sequoiadendron giganteum and its close relative, Sequoia sempervirens (redwood), are jointly designated as the State Tree of California.

 Sisyrinchium angustifolium, commonly called blue-eyed grass, is noted for its violet-blue flowers and branched flowering stems. Though its foliage is grass-like, the blue-eyed grasses belong to the iris family not the grass family. It is native to Missouri where it occurs in damp open woods, slopes and along stream banks throughout much of the State. It is a clump-forming perennial that features a tuft of narrow grass-like leaves (to 3/16"" wide) typically growing to 12"" (less frequently to 20"") tall. Clusters of violet-blue flowers (to 1/2"" across), each with 6 pointed tepals and a yellow eye, appear in spring on stalks growing from leaf-like bracts atop usually branched flowering stems which are distinctively flattened. Sisyrinchium campestre, also a Missouri native, features pale blue to white flowers atop unbranched flowering stems.

 Skimmia japonica, commonly called Japanese skimmia, is a dense, mounded, broad-leaved evergreen shrub that matures to 3-4' tall and to 5' wide. Female plants typically spread more than male plants. This shrub is ornamentally grown in shady locations for appreciation of its evergreen leaves, mildly fragrant white flowers in spring and red fruits on female plants in fall. It is native to Japan, China and Southeast Asia. Leathery, oval to obovate, dark green leaves (to 5"" long) with yellowish-green undersides are, for the most part, clustered somewhat whorl-like at the branch ends. Leaves are aromatic when crushed. Fragrant, creamy white flowers (1/4"" across), sometimes tinged pink, bloom in rounded terminal panicles (to 2-3"" long) at the branch tips in mid spring (April). Flowers on female shrubs are followed by small spherical red fruits (to 3/8"" across) which ripen in October and persist through winter. Male flowers are usually more fragrant and slightly larger than female flowers, but female flowers are the ones that bear the attractive red berries.Genus name comes from the Japanese name Shikimi.Specific epithet means of Japan.","Problems

Deadhead spent flowers to help prevent naturalization by wind-blown seed.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Ipomoea pandurata, commonly called wild potato vine, man-of-the-earth, man root and Indian potato, is a vigorous, twining or trailing perennial vine of the morning glory family that grows to 15-30’ long on smooth to slightly pubescent, sometimes purplish stems rising from a vertical, starchy root system that matures over time to as much as 4’ long with a weigh of 25-30 pounds. This vine is native to moist to somewhat dry habitats including fallow and cultivated fields, roadsides, dry slopes, railroad right-of-ways, and along streams in Eastern North America from Connecticut to Ontario to Michigan and Iowa south to Texas and Florida. It typically sprawls along the ground in open areas or climbs vegetation. It is found throughout most of the State of Missouri.  
 

 This vine is noted for its large, funnel-shaped, white flowers (2-3” across) with reddish purple eyes. Flowers bloom from the leaf axils in cymose inflorescences composed of up to 7 perfect actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) flowers from late May to September. The funnelform corolla of each flower has five shallow lobes. Simple, polymorphic (variable), olive green leaves are thin, entire, alternate, petiolate, cordate to ovate or occasionally pandurate (fiddle-shaped), with each leaf extending to 3-6” long with a pointed tip. Fruit is a glabrous, ovoid, 2-celled dehiscent capsule (to 3/5” long) which opens at maturity to disburse its hairy seeds to the wind.  
 

 Roots can be cooked and were an important food source for native Americans but fresh uncooked roots have purgative properties. Native Americans also used the roots for preparation of poultices, infusions and teas for treatment of a variety of medical problems including rheumatism, cholera, kidney disease, coughs, abdominal pains and constipation.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants. On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet means fiddle-like in reference to leaf shape.","Problems

 Eggplants are cold-sensitive and require a long warm season for best results. Plant seeds in sunny warm location in peat pots 8 to 10 weeks before transplanting into garden after all danger of frost is past and night temperatures are consistently at or above 65 degrees F. Eggplant roots are subject to cold damage and plants seldom recover from cold snaps. Plant in full sun in fertile, well-drained soil. Do not permit seedlings or young plants to suffer from low temperature or drought. Mulching between plants is useful. Space plants 18 to 24"" apart with 30 to 36"" between rows. Plants thrive in the heat of summer. Depending on the size of fruit you wish to harvest, pinch out terminal growth and blossoms to allow up to 6 fruits to mature or allow all fruits to set and harvest when small. For mature fruits, harvest after some color appears but always while fruits still have their glossy shine.","Noteworthy Characteristics

 Potatoes need space and sun, with fertile and well-drained sandy soil. Acid soil is best and reduces the likelihood of scab. Potatoes are tolerant of cool soil and moderate frost. In the spring, 2 to 3 weeks before the last average frost or as soon as the soil can be worked, plant ""seed potatoes"" 2 to 3"" deep, 12"" apart, in rows 2 1/2 to 3' apart. When plants are about 12"" tall, hill with a 6- to 8-"" high mound of straw, soil, or compost to keep developing tubers from exposure to sunlight. (Note: When exposed to sunlight, tubers turn green and develop a mildly toxic substance called solanine.) Also, leaving only a small portion of the vine exposed provides for additional root development. Once the plants blossom, stop hilling up the soil and apply a thick mulch to conserve moisture and control weeds. Water regularly and thoroughly. Dig early potatoes when tops begin to flower; dig mature potatoes when tops die down. Dig carefully to avoid bruising and cutting tubers.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Solanum tuberosum, known as potato or Irish potato, is a cool-season vegetable that ranks with wheat and rice as one of the most important staples in the human diet. The white potato is often referred to as the ""Irish potato"" because of Ireland’s 19th-century dependence on that vegetable as its primary food source. The Irish potato famine, caused by a blight also in the 19th century, points out the shortcomings of a nation-wide dependence on one variety of one crop type agriculture. The potato variety planted at that time was highly susceptible to that specific blight pathogen, and potato harvests were essentially nonexistent for several years. These past events, however, should not be a worry of the home gardener. Though not the most widely grown home garden vegetable, potatoes can be a very rewarding crop: 2 pounds of seed potatoes can yield 50 pounds of potatoes. There are more than 100 varieties of potatoes currently under cultivation, ranging from finger-sized tubers to tubers of such magnitude that one can feed a family. Colors of flesh include white, gray, golden, pink, deep yellow, and even a rich purple-blue.Genus name appears to come from the Latin word solamen meaning comfort, solace, or soothing in reference to the purported sedative and healing effects obtained from application of the leaves of some genus plants to cuts, wounds, inflammations or skin problems.Specific epithet means tuber.","Problems
 Colorado potato beetles, flea beetles, wireworms, and leafhoppers can reduce yields substantially. Potatoes are subject to several fungal, bacterial and viral diseases. Most can be avoided by rotating potatoes with non-Solanaceae crops, keeping the garden area free of debris and garden tools clean, and planting disease-free/disease-resistant cultivars. If diseases occur, remove and destroy all affected plants.","Garden Uses

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where it is easily grown in rich, organic, consistently moist but well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Performs best in bright but indirect light. Best in climates with daytime temperatures of 60-65 degrees F. and night time temperatures of 50-55 degrees F. Plants are intolerant of frost. Leaves remain evergreen in USDA Zones 10-11, but may lose foliage (becomes deciduous) in USDA Zone 9 over winter because of frost, with new growth reviving in spring. Plants are intolerant of direct sun (foliage will often scorch), high temperatures, droughty soils, or poorly-drained wet soils. Best in shady conditions. Once established, this groundcover can be difficult to eradicate. Intolerant of foot traffic. Works well indoors as a houseplant because it thrives in low-light conditions. Likes high humidity. Water freely in summer but reduce watering in winter (keep slightly moist). May be grown as an annual in areas with cold winter conditions.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Soleirolia soleirolii, commonly called baby's tears, is a creeping, mat-forming, evergreen perennial of the nettle family. It is native to certain islands in the western Mediterranean, primarily including Corsica and Sardinia. It is typically grown for its ornamental foliage. Upward growth is only 1-2"" (sometimes to 5"") tall, but plants spread aggressively and indefinitely (to 3-6' wide) by many-branched fragile stems which root in the ground as they go. Shiny, rich green to lime green rounded leaves (to 1/4"" diameter) form a dense, moss-like, quick-spreading groundcover. Miniature, creamy white flowers (May and June) lack petals and are ornamentally insignificant. Plant spread is sometimes characterized as invasive and weed-like, but plants are small and rather easy to uproot. Unfortunately any small stem section not removed will often regenerate.  
 

 Synonymous with and formerly known as Helxine soleirolii.Genus name honors Joseph Francois Soleirol (d. 1863) who made vast collections of specimens of Corsican plants in the first half of the 19th century.Specific epithet is also in reference to Captain Joseph Francois Soleirol.'Aurea' is a popular golden-leaved cultivar.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, grow as garden annuals or in pots that can be overwintered indoors or as houseplants. Grow in moist, organically rich, loose soils in part shade. Tolerates full shade. Some recently developed cultivars tolerate full sun. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. Remove flower spikes as they appear. Pinch plant stem tips to keep plants compact and to promote bushiness. Seed cultivars can be started indoors from seed 8-12 weeks before last frost date. Inexpensive starter plants (in small pots or flats) can be purchased from most nurseries in spring for beds and containers. Containers may be brought inside in fall before frost for overwintering. Similarly, favorite plants may be dug and potted in fall for overwintering as houseplants. Cuttings from favorite plants (easily rooted in a glass of water or in clean potting soil) can also be taken in fall for overwintering.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Plectranthus scutellarioides, commonly known as coleus, is a tropical evergreen tender perennial that has been a popular foliage plant since at least Victorian times. It is native to Southeast Asia and Malaysia. It has been assiduously hybridized over the years into a very large number of vegetatively propagated and seed propagated strains with an almost infinite number of leaf color combinations including most colors of the spectrum except true blue. Cultivars range in size from dwarf 6” tall plants to large mounded 36” tall plants. Four-sided stems are semi-succulent. Showy multi-colored leaves are generally ovate to oblong and toothed. Leaves frequently feature mixtures of colors in irregular patterns. Blue to white nettle-like flowers (more common on seed strains) bloom in racemes in summer to early fall, but are not showy and tend to visually detract from the symmetry and attractiveness of the plants.  
 

 Solenostemon scutellarioides and Coleus blumei are both synonyms and former names for this plant.Genus name comes from the Greek words plectron meaning spur and anthos meaning flower in reference to the spur-shaped flowers of some members of the genus.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Scutellaria which comes from the Latin word scutella meaning a small dish or saucer in reference to the shape of the persistent calyx after the flowers fade.","Problems

 Sorbus decora, commonly known as showy mountain ash or northern mountain ash, is a small, deciduous, understory tree (sometimes a tall shrub) that typically grows to 20-30’ (rarely to 60’) tall and features showy white spring flowers, pinnate-compound leaves and red fall fruit. It is native from Labrador and Newfoundland to Quebec south to Iowa, New York and Maine with scattered populations further south in the Appalachian mountains to North Carolina. It is very similar to and often grows in areas populated by American mountain ash (Sobus americana).
 

 Each odd pinnate leaf (to 10” long) has 11-15 lanceolate bluish-green to gray-green leaflets (each 2-4” long) which have pointed tips, serrate margins and are broadest in the middle.  Foliage turns yellow to red in fall. Five-petaled white flowers (to 1/ 4” across) bloom in dense clusters (flattened corymbs to 5” across) in May. Flowers are followed by clusters of shiny red fruits (each to 3/8” diameter) that ripen in late summer but remain on the tree after leaf drop. Branches typically bend downward from the weight of the ripe fruit. Each fruit (botanically a pome) contains 1-2 seeds. Fruits are attractive to birds and animals, but too bitter/acidic to be eaten fresh off the tree by humans. Fruits may be made into jellies.

 Best grown in moist, acidic, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun. As the common name of mountain ash suggests, this is a tree of cool mountain climates that dislikes dry soils and hot and humid summers. It will not grow well in the deep South below USDA Zone 6.  It is somewhat intolerant of urban pollution. It generally requires little pruning. Prune if needed from late fall to early spring.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Sorbus decora, commonly known as showy mountain ash or northern mountain ash, is a small, deciduous, understory tree (sometimes a tall shrub) that typically grows to 20-30’ (rarely to 60’) tall and features showy white spring flowers, pinnate-compound leaves and red fall fruit. It is native from Labrador and Newfoundland to Quebec south to Iowa, New York and Maine with scattered populations further south in the Appalachian mountains to North Carolina. It is very similar to and often grows in areas populated by American mountain ash (Sobus americana).
 

 Each odd pinnate leaf (to 10” long) has 11-15 lanceolate bluish-green to gray-green leaflets (each 2-4” long) which have pointed tips, serrate margins and are broadest in the middle.  Foliage turns yellow to red in fall. Five-petaled white flowers (to 1/ 4” across) bloom in dense clusters (flattened corymbs to 5” across) in May. Flowers are followed by clusters of shiny red fruits (each to 3/8” diameter) that ripen in late summer but remain on the tree after leaf drop. Branches typically bend downward from the weight of the ripe fruit. Each fruit (botanically a pome) contains 1-2 seeds. Fruits are attractive to birds and animals, but too bitter/acidic to be eaten fresh off the tree by humans. Fruits may be made into jellies. Smooth, gray bark becomes scaly with age.Genus name comes from the Latin name sorbum for the fruit of the service tree (Sorbus domestica).Specific epithet comes from the Latin word decoratus meaning decorative or showy in probable reference to the appearance of the fruit.Common name of mountain ash is in reference to the ash-like leaves and preference for cool mountain climates. Notwithstanding ash-like leaf appearance, this mountain ash is a member of the rose family and not the family of the true ashes (Fraxinus), which are in the olive family.","Problems
 Bacterial fireblight can be a severe problem, causing scorched leaves at the branch ends. Scab can cause significant defoliation. Cankers, crown gall, powdery mildew and rust may also occur. Insect visitors include borers, aphids, sawfly and scale. Stressed trees are generally more susceptible to attack from canker and borers.","Garden Uses

 Spartina pectinata, commonly called prairie cord grass, is a coarse, tough, warm season perennial grass that typically grows in a dense, arching clump to 4-7' tall when in flower. It is native to a large area of North America extending from Newfoundland to Alberta south to Oregon, New Mexico, Louisiana and North Carolina. Typical habitat is freshwater marshes, swampy open valleys, slough and pond margins, low spots along roads and railroads and both wet and dry prairie areas (Steyermark). Glossy dark green leaves (to 4' long and to 5/8"" wide) have sharp edges (wear gloves when working with this grass). Leaves turn yellow in autumn. Flower stems rise above the foliage clump in July-August bearing terminal clusters of straw-colored flowers arranged comb-like on cluster branches. This species is also commonly called slough grass and ripgut (sharp-edged leaves).Genus name comes from Greek spartine meaning cord in reference to the tough, fibrous leaves.Specific epithet comes from Latin pectinatus meaning comb in reference to the comb-like appearance of flower panicle branches.Prairie cord grass is a coarse, tough, warm season perennial grass that typically grows in a dense, arching clump to 4-7' tall when in flower.

 Spartium junceum, commonly called Spanish broom, is a multi-stemmed, sparsely-leaved, deciduous shrub that is typically found in dry areas, open woodlands, disturbed sites and along roads in the Mediterranean area (southern Europe to northern Africa). It has escaped gardens and naturalized in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Where winter hardy, it typically grows to 6-10' tall. It is primarily grown for its bright yellow flowers and cylindrical green stems. Young stems are rush-like, bright green and basically leafless. Older stems will develop a woody bark. Stems branch at the top, with flowers appearing in showy racemes. Flowers (to 1"" long) are bright yellow, pea-shaped and fragrant. Flowers bloom July to frost. Flowers are followed by flat seed pods (each to 3"" long). Linear to lanceolate leaves (to 1"" long) are bright green. Leaves are small in size, quite sparse in number and ephemeral (each leaf lasts about 4 months). Considerable photosynthesis occurs in the young green stems.Genus name comes from the Greek word spartion for a kind of grass used in weaving and cordage.Specific epithet means rush-like.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is easily grown in rich, moderately fertile, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates part shade, but best flowering is in full sun. May drop some leaves in dry seasons or when subjected to light frost. Must be sited in locations protected from wind because tree wood is weak and brittle. Gardeners need to prune after most rainstorms or light frosts to maintain good appearance. Near the edge of its area of winter hardiness, it may be planted as a shrub in a protected area to facilitate regular pruning and removal of dead branches. Propagate by seed, cuttings or root suckers.  Established plants have some drought tolerance, but trees subject to dry conditions often become ragged in appearance with some leaf drop.  Foliage will die if temperatures dip to 28 degrees F., but roots may survive to 20 degrees F. Notwithstanding its beauty, African tulip tree is considered to be an aggressive and invasive spreader in many tropical areas where it has been introduced. It produces abundant seeds which are carried by the wind or in the current of streams and rivers to new locations. In tropical climates, it can easily spread into disturbed sites, abandoned farmland, pastures, forest margins and waste areas.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Spathodea campanulata, commonly called African tulip tree, is a large, fast-growing tree that is native of tropical African forests where it typically grows to as much as 80' tall. In cultivation, it grows to a much shorter 25-40' tall. It is noted for producing an often extraordinary bloom of reddish-orange, tulip-like flowers at the tips of branches clad with attractive pinnate compound evergreen leaves. This tree has now been extensively planted as an ornamental in tropical areas around the world. In the U. S., it currently grows in far southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii. Best ornamental display usually occurs in locations where trees are protected from strong winds and can develop large, rounded, umbrella-like crowns. Although generally considered to be everblooming, specific flowering times for this tree vary somewhat depending upon climate and geographic location. In southern Florida, the main bloom occurs in spring (March-April) with continued but irregular additional bloom throughout remaining part of the year. Somewhat buttressed trunk has warty gray bark. Each large compound leaf (to 20"" long) has 5-19 deeply veined oval leaflets (to 4"" long). Upward-facing campanulate flowers (each to 3"" across) in dense clusters (racemes) emerge from velvety, horn-shaped buds located at the branch tips. Each flower is reddish orange with a crinkled yellow corolla margin and 4 brown-anthered center stamens. Flowers are followed by upward pointing, greenish brown seed pods (to 8"" long), each of which contains about 500 papery seeds with transparent winglets. Pods split open when ripe to release abundant seed to the wind.  Wood is weak and brittle. High winds can do significant damage to branches and tree shape.Genus name comes from the Greek word spathe a flower part and odes meaning of the nature of in reference to the spathe or boat-like calyx.Specific epithet means bell-shaped in reference to the flowers.","Problems

 Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10-11 where plants are best grown in rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates part shade. Consider raised beds as a way to create sharp drainage. Thrives in sandy loams. Avoid overwatering which may encourage the onset of root rot. Root mulch helps retain soil moisture in hot summer climates. In St. Louis, sweetleaf can be grown as an annual. Purchase starter plants if available. Seed (if obtainable) can be started indoors in early spring for planting outside after last spring frost date. Plants may be grown in pots set out on patios during the growing season. Snip off flower buds as they appear (best quality leaves occur prior to flowering). Harvest leaves in fall. If overwintering, bring pots indoors before first fall frost. Cutting may be taken.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Stevia rebaudiana, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a tender perennial herb that is native to Paraguay and Brazil. Plants typically grow with weak and floppy stems to 12-24"" tall. Plants have little ornamental attraction. The attraction here is the sweet tasting leaves which contain glucoside compounds that are 200-300 times sweeter by weight than cane sugar but with no calories. To date, the FDA has only approved limited use for this plant in the U.S. (Rebaudioside A approved as dietary supplement but stevia leaves are not approved as food additive), but its potential as a sugar-substitute is huge. Slender oblong leaves (to 1"") have a pronounced midrib. Tubular flowers are white with no fragrance. Harvest fresh leaves for use in teas. Eat leaves directly off the plant. Leaves may be dried and then saved in jars for future use. Dried leaves are generally sweeter than fresh leaves. Dried leaves may be ground up in a blender into stevia powder.Genus name honors Pedro Jaime Esteve (d. 1566) of Valencia, Spanish botanist and physician.","Problems

 Warm season tender perennial grass that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10.  Best in moist, medium fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Performs well in a variety of soils including both clay and sandy loams. Established plants have good drought tolerance. Spreads, sometimes invasively, by self-seeding and rhizomes to form large colonies which choke out most other plants.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Pennisetum macrourum, commonly called African feather grass, is a tender perennial grass that is native to southern Africa, tropical Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen). It has been introduced in various other parts of the world. Notwithstanding its ornamental beauty, it is noted for spreading invasively by rhizomes and self-seeding in parts of the southern U.S. and Australia. This grass is included on the U.S. Noxious Weed List plus the regulated lists of several states (Alabama, California, Oregon, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Vermont). This is a rapid-growing, clump-forming grass that produces upright, arching, narrow, linear green leaves growing in dense clumps to 3-4' tall with unbranched stems (culms) topped by cylindrical flower panicles which rise above the leaves to 5-6’ tall.  
 

 Light green leaves (to 1/2” wide) grow from the base of the plant to 45” tall. Leaf margins are sometimes purple-tinted. Leaves consist of a leaf sheath which partially encloses the stem and a spreading linear blade. Flowers appear in late spring and summer in erect or drooping, long, thin, cat-tail-like panicles (each to 4-16” long x 3/4” across) which are green or yellow green sometimes tinged with purple, yellow or brown. Flower spikelets are surrounded by finely-barbed feathery bristles. Flowers turn straw colored as they mature.Genus name comes from the Latin penna meaning feather and seta meaning bristle in reference to the flowers having long, feathery bristles.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macros meaning long and oura meaning tail in reference to the flower spikes.Common name refers to native territory (Africa) and feathery bristles on the flower heads.","Problems

 Winter hardy to zones 10 to 12, Strelitzia reginae is an easy plant to grow in the garden. Plants do well in full sun to semi-shade, love a rich loamy soil and plenty of water throughout the year. They respond well to regular feeding with a slow release fertilizer and compost. They are, however, very tolerant plants and will thrive in most soils and can survive with very little water once established. The plants are also wind resistant and grow well in coastal gardens. Strelitzias are sensitive to cold and would need a sheltered position in areas with frost, as the flowers and leaves are often damaged by frost. In cold climates, it is better to grow them in pots that can be moved indoors when freezing temperatures are expected. 
 

 To grow indoors, pick a well-lit, sunny spot. In the summer months screen against the very bright direct sun. Water plants freely and fertilize regularly in spring and summer. Keep drier in winter months and use a well-drained soil. Bird of paradise need moderate temperatures 55 to 65F at night. When temperatures rise above 70F. outside, place your plant in a semi-shaded location with good air circulation. Remove dead leaves and flowers as they occur.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Strelitzia reginae, called bird of paradise, is probably one of the most well-known plants in the world. It is a bold structural plant, which forms large evergreen clumps of stiff leaves growing up from the base. The grey-green banana-like leaves grow about 3 ½ to 4 feet in height and the flowers stand above the foliage at the tips of long stalks. The structure and pollination of the flowers are rather interesting. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges, is called the spathe. This is placed at right angles to the stem, which gives it the appearance of a bird’s head. The flowers, which emerge one at a time from the spathe, consist of 3 brilliant orange sepals and 3 bright blue petals. Two of the blue petals are joined together to form an arrow-like nectary. When the birds sit to have a drink of nectar, the petals open to cover their feet with pollen.Genus name honors Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744-1818), who in 1761 became Queen to George III.Specific epithet means of the queen.","Problems

 Syringa vulgaris, commonly known as common lilac, is an upright, multi-stemmed, suckering, deciduous shrub in the olive family that typically matures to 12-16’ (20’) tall with a spread to 8-12’ (15’) wide. It is native to open woodlands, rocky hills and scrubby areas in southeastern Europe, but has been widely cultivated throughout Europe (beginning in the late 1500s) and North America (brought over by colonists in the early 1600s).  It is particularly noted for its mid to late spring (May) bloom of very fragrant, tubular, 4-lobed, lilac to purple flowers (each to 1/3” long) which bloom in large conical to narrow-pyramidal panicles (to 6-8” long). Flowers give way to loose clusters of smooth, brown, flattened, dehiscent seed capsules (each to 3/ 4” long) which persist into winter if not removed. Glaucous, opposite, pointed-ovate to heart-shaped leaves (2-5” long) are dark gray-green to blue green. No fall color. Bark is gray to gray-brown. 
 

 Numerous cultivars have been introduced over time in both single and double-flowered forms. Cultivars extend the range of available flower colors to include shades of white, cream, rose, magenta, pinkish-purple, lavender and purple. 
 

 Common lilac has few post-bloom ornamental features of note. Significant post-bloom limitations include often leggy shrub form, foliage depreciation from powdery mildew, non-showy fruits and absence of fall foliage color.

If not grafted or otherwise supported, the foliage of this weeping cultivar would simply sprawl along the ground as a ground cover.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Taxodium distichum, commonly called bald cypress, is a long-lived, pyramidal conifer (cone-bearing tree) which grows 50-70' tall (less frequently to 125'). Although it looks like a needled evergreen (same family as redwoods) in summer, it is deciduous (""bald"" as the common name suggests). It is native to southern swamps, bayous and rivers, primarily being found in coastal areas from Maryland to Texas and in the lower Mississippi River valley to as far north as the southeast corner of Missouri. In the deep South, it is a familiar sight growing directly in swampy water, often in large strands, with its branches heavily draped with Spanish moss. In cultivation, however, it grows very well in drier, upland soils. Trunks are buttressed (flared or fluted) at the base, and when growing in water, often develop distinctive, knobby root growths (""knees"") which protrude above the water surface around the tree. Soft, feathery, yellowish-green foliage (1/4"" long, flat needles in two ranks) turns an attractive orange/cinnamon-brown in fall. Rounded, wrinkled, 1 inch diameter, purplish-green cones mature to brown. Heavy, straight-grained, rot-resistant wood has been used for a variety of purposes including barrels, railroad ties and shingles. Closest relative is the dawn redwood (Metasequoia) which is also deciduous. State tree of Louisiana.Genus name comes from the Latin word Taxus meaning yew and the Greek word eidos meaning resemblance from a similarity of leaf shape.Specific epithet means is two ranks for the needle arrangement.‘Cascade Falls' is a compact weeping form that typically grows to 8-12' tall over the first 10-15 years, eventually maturing to as much as 20' tall. It was discovered growing on the bank of a lake on cultivated property in Albany, Auckland, New Zealand. Branches hang outward and then plunge vertically toward the ground. This cultivar does not produce viable seed. U.S. Plant Patent PP12,296 was issued on December 18, 2001.","Problems

It is typically sold by nurseries in the St. Louis area as a container plant for patios in somewhat the same manner as Mandevilla and Bougainvillea. It features odd pinnate medium green leaves with ovate-oblong toothed leaflets (2-4” long). Trumpet-shaped bright yellow flowers (to 2” long) in axillary and terminal racemes bloom continuously from late spring to frost. Flowers are slightly fragrant. Flowers are followed by narrow bean-like capsules (to 8” long) that are filled with papery-winged seeds. Common names for Tecoma stans plants include trumpet bush, esperanza (Spanish for hope), yellow elder, yellow bells or yellow bignonia.Genus name comes from an abbreviated from the Mexican name tecomaxochitl.Specific epithet means erect or upright.","Problems

 Teucrium chamaedrys, commonly called wall germander, is a shrubby, woody-based, clump-forming, broad leaf evergreen which is grown ornamentally for its attractive, aromatic, evergreen foliage. Features 3/4"", oval, scalloped, shiny dark green leaves on numerous ascending and spreading stems which collectively form a mound of foliage 12-15"" tall. Leaves resemble miniature oak leaves (chamaedrys means ""ground oak"" in reference to the leaf shape and ground cover habit). Whorls of two lipped, tubular, pink to purple (less frequently white) flowers (typical mint family) appear in terminal clusters in late spring to early summer. Leaves were formerly used in a variety of medicinal treatments.Genus name comes from the Greek name, possibly named for Teucer, first king of Troy.Specific epithet comes from the Greek chamai meaning of the ground or dwarf and drys meaning oak.","Problems

 Cascabela thevetia, commonly called yellow oleander, is native to the West Indies, southern Mexico and Belize. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree that is in the same family as and closely related to Nerium oleander, commonly known as oleander. Primary differences between the two oleanders are: yellow oleander has yellow flowers and alternate leaves and oleander has pink or white flowers with leaves in whorls of three. Yellow oleander will grow to 20-30’ tall in its native habitat, but much shorter in the St. Louis area. It is an upright shrub that features willow-like, linear-lanceolate, glossy green leaves (to 6-7” long) with distinctive midribs and large 3” long funnel-shaped sometimes-fragrant yellow (less commonly apricot) flowers in few-flowered terminal clusters (cymes). Flowers bloom from summer to fall. Flowers give way to black seed pods, each containing 1-2 nut-like seeds. As with many of the dogbane family members, plant stems exude a milky sap when cut and all parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested. Plant saps can cause allergic skin reactions in some people. Smoke from burning plant material can also be toxic. May be trained as a standard. Seeds (1” diameter) are sometimes carried as talismen in the West Indies, where the shrubs are also commonly called lucky nut.

 Tilia cordata, commonly called littleleaf linden, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in the U.S. as an ornamental shade tree because of its (a) attractive foliage, (b) dense, low-branched, pyramidal to ovate form and (c) tolerance for urban conditions. Ornamental features include fragrant pale yellow flowers in late spring, small nutlets with attached leafy wings (to 3.5” long) and ovate, shiny dark green leaves (to 3” long) with acuminate tips, serrate margins and cordate bases. This is a medium to large deciduous tree, typically growing to 50-70’ (less frequently to 100’) tall. Fragrant, creamy yellow flowers in drooping cymes appear in June. When a tree is in full bloom, bees often visit in such abundant numbers that humming can be heard many feet from the tree. Flowers give way to nutlets that are attached to narrow bract-like wings (top 3.5” long). Nutlets ripen in late summer. Fall color is an undistinguished pale green to pale yellow.

 In a protected location, this windmill palm is considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 7. It is not reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area where it may not survive harsh winters. It is typically grown in organically rich, moderately fertile, evenly moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best performance is in part shade. Site in protected locations that are sheltered from winter winds. Mature plants will usually survive 10 degree F. temperatures in winter (sometime colder). Of the arborescent (trunked) palms, windmill palm has the best winter hardiness. Of the non-arborescent (trunkless) palms, Rhapidophyllum hystrix and Sabal minor have slightly better winter hardiness. Plant crown may need protection (e.g. plastic sheet) when temperatures head toward single digits. Mulch around the base of the plant in winter. Plants may be propagated by seed, but male and female plants are required for seed production to occur.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Trachycarpus fortunei, commonly called windmill palm, is native to subtropical and temperate mountain forests of China where it typically grows to 20-40’ (sometimes to 60’) tall with a solitary trunk densely covered with hair-like fibers from old leaf sheaths. From the top of the trunk, large palmate fan-shaped dark green leaves (to 3’ wide) push outward in all directions on 2-3’ long petioles in a form purportedly resembling a windmill. Leaves are segmented about half way, with the segment tips often drooping. In cultivation in cold winter areas of USDA Zones 6-7, windmill palm will typically grow at most to 8-10’ tall. For a palm, it has excellent winter hardiness. Attractive yellowish flowers in drooping panicles (to 2’ long) bloom in summer. Female flowers (plants are dioecious) give way to dark blue drupes. In China, fibers from the trunks of mature trees are stripped for weaving into a decorative hemp-like rope or for making brooms, mats or cloth. Genus name is from Greek meaning rough (trachy) and fruit (carpus) in probable reference to fruit appearance.Genus name comes from the Greek words trachys meaning rough and karpos meaning a fruit in reference to the fruit of some species.Specific epithet honors Robert Fortune (1812-1880), Scottish horticulturist.","Problems

Deadhead each flower cluster after all buds in the cluster have opened to extend the bloom period. As the heat of the summer sets in, foliage tends to decline considerably and flowering slows down or stops entirely, at which point plants should be cut back hard. Cutting back plants almost to the ground will promote both new foliage growth and an additional late summer to fall bloom. Divide clumps when they become overcrowded.It is expected that the foliage of ‘Blushing Bride‘ will retain its best variegated color in part shade locations. Plant leaves may turn entirely green over time in full sun exposures.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Tradescantia, commonly called spiderworts, is a genus of about 65 species of herbaceous perennials from North, Central and South America. They are grown for their showy flowers or attractive foliage. Andersoniana Group includes hybrids of T. virginiana, T. subaspera and T. ohiensis.Genus name honors John Tradescant (1570-1638) and his son John Tradescant (1608-1662), botanists and successive gardeners to Charles I of England.When the stems of spiderworts are cut, a viscous stem secretion is released which becomes thread-like and silky upon hardening (like a spider’s web), hence the common name.‘Blushing Bride’ is a clump-forming, hybrid spiderwort that is noted for its unique variegated foliage. It typically grows to 12-18” tall. Dayflower-like green foliage emerges in spring with pink blotches at the base of each leaf. The pink blotches turn white as the plants mature providing interesting variegated leaves. Three-petaled, white flowers (to 1.5” diameter) accented by contrasting yellow stamens are borne in terminal clusters (umbels) atop stiff stems. Numerous flower buds form in each cluster, but individual flowers open up only a few at at time, each for only one day, blooming in succession from May into summer.","Problems

Intolerant of drought and should be watered regularly in prolonged dry spells, particularly when plants are young. Appreciates a thick winter mulch.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Tsuga canadensis, commonly called Canadian hemlock or eastern hemlock, is a dense, pyramidal conifer of the pine family that is native to moist woods, moist slopes, rocky hillsides/ridges, wooded ravines, and stream valleys from eastern Canada south to Maine and Wisconsin and further south in the Appalachian Mountains to Georgia and Alabama. It grows to 40-75’ tall in the wild. This species is noted for having the smallest needles and cones in the genus. Flat sprays of lacy evergreen foliage give this tree a graceful form. Short dark green needles (to 9/16"" long) with two white bands beneath are arranged in two opposite rows. Needles are attached to twigs by slender stalks. Small, pendant, short-stalked, seed-bearing cones (to 3/4"" long) are tan-brown. Lower branches often dip toward the ground. Thick and ridged bark on mature trees is red-brown to gray-brown. State tree of Pennsylvania. No part of this tree is poisonous. The poisonous hemlocks (Circuta maculata and Conium maculatum) are herbaceous perennials in the parsley family.Genus name of Tsuga is derived from the Japanese name for trees in this genus.Specific epithet means native in part to Canada.","Problems
 A healthy plant in the proper environment has few problems. Potential disease problems for plants in the genus Tusga include needle blight (needles turn yellow and die), canker, rusts and rots. Potential insect problems include bagworms, borers, leaf miner, saw fly and spider mites. Foliage may scorch in very hot weather. Prolonged drought can be fatal.  
 

 Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is a tiny (1/32”) sap-sucking insect (relative of the aphid) that has recently become a serious threat to the survival of native hemlocks in the wild in the eastern United States. HWA was accidentally introduced into the U. S. in the 1920s from Eastern Asia. It has been known to exist in the Pacific Northwest since 1927, but was first observed in the forests of Virginia in the 1950s. It has now spread from Virginia into the southern and middle Appalachians. Inability to survive cold winters has so far substantially limited HWA’s northern spread to as far as Massachusetts, but northward expansion into much of New England is expected as winter temperatures continue to moderate. HWA has killed most of the old growth hemlocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and 95% of the hemlocks in Shenandoah National Park. HWA was discovered in Pennsylvania’s Allegheny National Park in November of 2013.  Treatment of HWA is available (pesticides containing imidacloprid or dinotefuran), but control of this pest is very difficult.","Garden Uses

 Tsuga heterophylla, commonly known as western hemlock, is a pyramidal needled evergreen tree of the pine family. It features a narrow pyramidal crown that typically grows in cultivation to 70-150’ but may soar to as much as 250’ tall in the wild. It is the largest of the hemlock trees. It is native from Southern Alaska south through British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and those parts of northern California which are west of the Cascade Mountains plus in the northern Rocky Mountains in Canada and the northern U.S. Trees typically do not perform well outside of their native range. Needles (1/4” to 3/4” long and to 1/16” wide) are shiny dark green with white rows beneath. Cones grow to 1 1/8” long, and are pendulous (hang from the branch tips). Reddish-brown bark is up to 1.5” thick and develops deep scaly ridges. This species is the state tree of the State of Washington.Genus name of Tsuga is derived from the Japanese name for trees in this genus.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words heteros meaning different and phyllon meaning leaf.‘Thorsen’s Weeping’, by contrast, is a dwarf, prostrate, ground cover version of this tree. It features emerald green foliage and procumbent branches. It can sprawl along the ground as a ground cover to only 4” tall and to 5’ across over the first 5 years. If staked or otherwise supported to a desired height, it can grow over time in a cascading mound to the desired height, typically 3-5’ tall, with gracefully weeping branches which sweep to the ground.","Problems
 A healthy plant in the proper environment has few problems. Potential disease problems for plants in the genus Tusga include needle blight (needles turn yellow and die), canker, rusts and rots. Potential insect problems include bagworms, borers, leaf miner, saw fly and spider mites. Woody adelgid (an aphid) is particularly troublesome in the Northeast where it can be fatal (has spread significantly since the 1950s). Foliage may scorch in very hot weather.

 Vernonia noveboracensis, commonly called ironweed or New York ironweed, is a tall, coarse, upright perennial which typically occurs in the wild in moist thickets, low areas and along streambanks from Massachusetts to Mississippi. Features numerous tiny, fluffy, deep purple, composite flowers (rays absent) in loose, 3-4"" wide, terminal clusters (cymes) atop stiff, leafy stems typically growing 4-6' tall. Somewhat suggestive of Joe Pye weed, except leaves of ironweed are alternate. Blooms late summer into fall. Rough, pointed, serrate, lance-shaped leaves (6-8"" long). Flowers give way to rusty seed clusters. The source of the common name has been varyingly attributed to certain ""iron-like"" plant qualities including the tough stems, the rusty-tinged color of fading flowers and the rusty colored seeds.Genus name honors William Vernon (d. c. 1711), English botanist who collected in Maryland in 1698.Specific epithet means of New York.","Problems

 Vigna caracalla, commonly called corkscrew vine, corkscrew flower or snail flower, is a rapid-growing twining perennial vine in the pea family that is native to tropical areas of Central and South America. It is evergreen in frost free climates. It is noted for producing an ornamentally attractive July to October bloom of white and lilac-purple (sometimes marked with yellow and cream) spirally twisted flowers (each to 2” long) on erect racemes to 12” long. Flowers curl in a manner somewhat reminiscent of a snail’s shell. Vines are clad with 3-palmate green leaves (each leaf having three leaflets to 3-5” long). This vine typically matures to 12-20’ (occasionally to 30’). Each flower has a unique structure consisting of a broad-oval backward-curled upper petal (the standard) plus two coiled, fused and elongated central petals (the keel) and two side petals (the wings). Flowers are highly fragrant. Blooms occur mid-summer to frost. Flowers are followed by slender, dangling, bean-like pods (6-7” long and 1” wide) which contain rounded brown seeds. Flowers are mostly pollinated by ants.  
 

 Corkscrew vine has naturalized, sometimes spreading aggressively, in parts of California. 
 

 Flowers spirally twist on the vine in a manner suggestive of a corkscrew, hence the common name of corkscrew vine.Genus name honors Dominicus Vigna (1581-1647), Italian scientist/professor and botanist.Specific epithet honors Caracas, Venezuela which is part of the native habitat of this plant.","Problems

 Vinca minor commonly know as vinca or periwinkle is one of the most popular and widely used ground covers. Trailing stems with smooth, evergreen leaves (to 1.5"" long) root at the nodes as they go along the ground and quickly spread to form an attractive ground cover. Tubular, lavender blue, phlox-like flowers (to 1 inch across) appear in the leaf axils in spring and continue to flower intermittently throughout summer into fall. Foliage will mound up to 6"" tall. Also commonly called dwarf periwinkle and creeping myrtle.Genus name is from Latin meaning to bind or wind around in reference to the long, flexible stems that were used in wreath making.Specific epithet means smaller. The leaves of Vinca minor are smaller than those of Vinca major.","Problems

 Best grown in slightly acidic, humusy, moderately fertile, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Full sun is needed for best flowering. Although vines may produce flowers by the second or third year after planting, first flowering may take longer. Vines need regular pruning(s) in order to control size and shape of the plant and to encourage flowering. Consult a pruning guide for specifics on the initial training of vines and the types of pruning that can or should be done for these plants. An application of fertilizer in early spring can also help stimulate flowering. Choose growing sites wisely because plants dislike being transplanted.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Wisteria frutescens, commonly called American wisteria, is a counterclockwise twining deciduous woody vine that grows to 40’ or more. It is native primarily to moist thickets, swampy woods, pond peripheries and stream borders from Virginia to Illinois south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, Wisteria frutescens var. macrostachya is found in the far southeastern bootheel area. Fragrant, pea-like, lilac-purple flowers in drooping racemes to 6” long bloom in April-May after the leaves emerge but before they fully develop. Limited additional summer bloom may occur. Flowers give way to narrow, flattened, smooth seed pods (to 5” long) which ripen in summer. Pods typically split open in fall. Compound, odd-pinnate leaves (each leaf typically with 9-15 lance-shaped leaflets) are deep green. American wisteria is not as aggressive a spreader as Wisteria sinensis (Chinese wisteria). Both Wisteria frutescens (American wisteria) and Wisteria sinensis (Chinese wisteria) twine in a counterclockwise direction but Wisteria floribunda (Japanese wisteria) twines clockwise.Genus name honors Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania.Specific epithet means shrubby or woody.","Problems
 Although susceptible to a number of foliage-chewing insects and fungal diseases, none are significant. Failure of vines to produce flowers may be attributable to a number of causes including death of flower buds in winter, too much shade, plants too young (especially seed grown ones), improper pruning or overfertilization.","Garden Uses

 Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where plants are best grown in full sun to part shade in areas with high humidity and consistently moist summer soils. Less soil moisture is needed in winter when plants go dormant. Plants will naturalize in the garden by thick, branching, aromatic rhizomes. A single plant can expand to form a large clump within several years. In Zones 8-10, rhizomes do not need to be lifted in fall for overwintering indoors, but a winter mulch may be appropriate in areas of Zone 8. North of Zone 8, rhizomes must be lifted in fall and brought indoors for overwintering in a cool location. Propagate by rhizome division in late winter to early spring.","Noteworthy Characteristics
 Zingiber zerumbet, commonly known as pinecone ginger, shampoo ginger or wild ginger, is a rhizomatous, clump-forming perennial which typically grows to 3.5-4’ tall, but occasionally to 6-7’ tall, on reed-like stems (to 30” long) clad with narrow green leaves. It is native to India and Southeast Asia where it is often cultivated as a home garden plant. It has been transported over time to many tropical areas in the Pacific Ocean with subsequent naturalization. Polynesians brought this plant to Hawaii in canoes many years ago. Although native to tropical areas, this plant goes dormant in winter and accordingly is not evergreen. It is now cultivated worldwide for its culinary and medical uses.  
 

 In spring, each plant produces 9-12 blade-shaped leaves (each to 8” long) on erect stems rising to 4’ tall. Flower stalks emerge from the rhizomes in mid- to late summer, each being topped by a globular inflorescence (to 4” long) of overlapping, green waxy bracts resembling a pine cone.  Insignificant, 3-petaled, pale yellowish-white flowers begin to bloom, a few at a time, from between the bracts. Inflorescences are initially green but gradually turn red as they fill with a creamy, ginger-scented, sap-like liquid, finally maturing to bright red after flowering is completed. Flower stalks are shorter than the leaf stalks and often remain somewhat concealed within the plant.
 

 Rhizome extracts have been traditionally used in herbal medicines in parts of eastern Asia.Genus name comes from the Greek name which, in turn, is said to derive from an East Indian word cognate with Pali sigivera.Common name of pinecone ginger is in reference to the pinecone shape of the inflorescence. Shampoo ginger common name relates to the creamy liquid substance in the cones which may be extracted by squeezing for use as a hair shampoo and/or hair conditioner. This substance is an added ingredient in some commercial shampoos. Wild ginger common name relates to the use of the rhizome as a food additive for culinary flavoring in various cuisines. These rhizomes are clearly edible, but bitter tasting in comparison to the commonly-sold rhizomes of commercial ginger (Zingiber officinale).","Problems
