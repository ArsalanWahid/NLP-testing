Culture
Annual that is easily grown in moist, moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Best flowering is in full sun.  Thrives in hot summer climates.  Seeds are sensitive to cold temperatures and should not be planted outside until soil temperatures have risen to 60 degree F. and night temperatures no longer dip below 55 degrees F.  As an alternative, seed may be started indoors about 1-2 weeks prior to last frost date with seedling planted outside as soon as soils warm.  Harvest the pods when they reach 3"" long.  First harvest of okra will occur about 55 days after seeds sprout.  Seed may be harvested from garden plants for planting the following year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abelmoschus esculentus, commonly called okra, is native to tropical Africa and Asia. It is an annual that typically grows 3-5' tall. It is grown for harvest of its edible fruit/seed pods which are perhaps best noted as the signature ingredient in gumbo. Species plants feature hibiscus-like yellow flowers (to 2-3” wide) with purplish centers. Cultivars expand the available flower colors to include attractive shades of pink, orange-red and red often with white centers. Flowers last only for one day, but plants bloom freely throughout the growing season to frost. Flowers give way to fruit capsules which have a musky aroma, hence the common name. Hairy, dark green leaves are deeply cut into 3-7 lobes.Genus name is believed to come from the Arabic abu-l-mosk in reference to the smell of the seeds.Specific epithet means good to eat or edible.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids.  Corn earworm.  Watch for spider mites, slugs and whiteflies.  Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils.  Susceptible to powdery mildew.   Some people develop skin rashes when working with this plant (wear gloves to avoid contact with stems and leaves).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies balsamea, commonly called balsam fir, is native to moist woods and bottomlands from Labrador to Alberta south to northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, New England, New York and further south in the Appalachians to Virginia.  It is a primary component of the boreal forest that stretches across Canada.  This is an aromatic, symmetrical, narrow, pyramidal to conical evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown.  It typically grows to 50-70' (less frequently to 90') tall and to 15-25' wide.  It appears, albeit in a diminished shrubby form, as far north as the timber line.  Resinous branches are densely clad with flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1"" long).  Needles are unstalked with circular bases and are white-banded beneath.  Smooth gray-brown bark (greenish when young but brown and scaly on older trees) is covered with blisters which contain a sticky aromatic resin.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 2-4"" long) appear at the crown.  Cones are purple when young.  As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.  Cones disintegrate (scales drop) after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet refers to the fragrant quality of the tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include Balsam woolly adelgids, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight. Trees are generally intolerant of urban pollution.

Culture
Best grown in rich, medium moisture, slightly acidic, sandy/gravelly, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Established trees tolerate some soil dryness, but best performance usually comes with moist soils. Trees generally grow poorly in heavy clay soils. This tree thrives in areas with long winters followed by cool summer climates, and it usually does not grow well in the heat and humidity south of USDA Zone 7. It is, however, considered to be the best of the firs for tolerating the growing conditions of the Midwest.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies concolor, commonly called white fir or concolor fir, is primarily native to mountain slopes (3000-9000 feet in elevation) in the western U.S., including the southern Cascades and Sierras from Oregon to southern California and the Rockies from southern Idaho to Arizona and New Mexico. In the wild, it typically grows to 80-130’ tall, but on residential landscapes in the Midwest will more typically grow to 40-70’ tall with a spread to 20-30’. This is a narrow conical conifer with a straight trunk, spire-like crown and branching to the base. Upper branches tend to grow upward, but the lower branches tend to recline. With age, crowns flatten and lower branching begins to disappear. Soft, flattened, pale blue-green needles (to 2 1/2” long) have uniform coloration on both surfaces (specific epithet is in reference to this). Slightly barrel-shaped cones (to 3-6” long) are most often yellowish-green, maturing to brown or purple. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches. Trees may not produce cones and seeds for up to the first 40 years. Bark is ash-gray and smooth, but will furrow with age.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet means the same color throughout.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include balsam woolly adelgid, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Disease problems include root rot, needle rust and twig blight. Trees are generally intolerant of urban pollution. Broken branches often become sites for fungal infections. Strong winds may damage taller trees.

New growth in April is susceptible to damage from late spring frosts.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies firma, commonly called momi fir or Japanese fir, is a large, aromatic, conical-pyramidal, needled evergreen conifer that typically grows to 100-150’ tall in its native habitat.  It is likely to mature to a much smaller height (to 40-60’ tall) in cultivation in the U.S.  Branches on younger trees are ascending, but become more horizontal with age.  This fir is native to hills and mountain slopes in central to southern Japan from near sea level to about 6,000’ where it grows in a variety of locations on both dry and moist sites.  It is the most widely distributed fir in Japan where it is considered to be an important timber tree (flooring, crates, and paper pulp). 

Needles (to 1 1.5” long) are strongly two ranked, appearing like a 2-sided comb, forming a wide V shape on the lower twigs.  Needles on young trees are tipped by two sharp prickles at the apex.  Scaly, rough, fissured bark is gray, but becomes corky as it darkens with age.  Flowers appear in April-May.  Conical seed cones (to 3.5 to 5” long) emerge green in spring, but mature to yellowish-brown and are erect and showy throughout summer.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.  Much smaller cylindrical pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to the firm needles.Momi is the Japanese word for fir.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale.  This species appears immune to attack from the balsam woolly adelgid which is a significant problem for some other species of fir.  Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.  Potential disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies fraseri, commonly called Fraser fir, is native to a very small area of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee extending into the southwestern corners of Virginia and West Viginia. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 4500’ to 6900’. It is the only fir that is indigenous to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although rare in nature, Fraser fir is one of the most popular Christmas trees sold in commerce today, and is commonly grown in tree farms for that purpose. This is a narrow, pyramidal, evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown. It grows to 30-50’ tall over time with a spread of 10-25’. It is very similar to balsam fir (Abies balsamea), the primary difference being in the bracts of the cone scales. Flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1” long) are white-banded beneath. Needles are densely borne on resinous stems. Resin blisters may appear on the bark, giving rise to a regional common name of she-balsam for this tree. Seed cones are purple with conspicuously protruding bracts. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet and common name honor John Fraser (1750-1811), Scottish botanist and plant collector, who discovered this plant and introduced it to Britain.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Balsam woolly adelgid has been responsible for killing a number of trees in the wild.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies grandis, commonly called grand fir, is a large, evergreen fir with a spire crown in youth that typically rounds into a multiple-leadered dome with age.  It is native to moist coastal bottomlands and alpine slopes from sea level to 6000’ in elevation in the Pacific Northwest from southwestern British Columbia south to northern California and in a disjunct population in the Rocky Mountains from southeastern British Columbia to central Idaho and far northwestern Montana.  It will grow to 200-250’ tall with a 4-6’ trunk diameter in Pacific coniferous forests and alpine slopes in coastal areas west of the cascades (greatest height is in coniferous rain forests on the Olympic peninsula of Washington), but to 130-160’ with a 2-4’ trunk diameter in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and in the Rocky Mountains.   This is one of the tallest firs in the world, hence the common name.  

Smooth gray bark develops ridges and furrows as it ages to brown.  Flat needles (to 2 1/2” long) are shiny dark green above with two white stomatal lines beneath.  Needles have blunt to slightly notched tips.  Needles emit a balsamy, tangerine-like aroma when crushed, hence the additional common name of stinking fir for this tree.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 4.5” long) stand upright above the needles near the tips of the upper branches, emerging green in spring, but maturing to yellowish-brown sometimes tinged blue-gray to purple.  Oblong pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils under the needles.  Pollen cones are pale yellow.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to large tree size.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  The balsam woolly adelgid is a significant problem in some areas.  Additional potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, tussock moths, aphids, bagworms and scale.  Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.  Potential disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acacia koa, commonly known as koa, is a large, fast-growing, evergreen tree of the pea family that is native to the Hawaiian Islands where it typically matures to 50-80’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with a dense broad-spreading crown.  It is usually found in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 300’ to 7000’ on the larger Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and Hawaii).  It is the second most common tree in the Hawaiian Islands.  

Mature trees have stiff, dull green, sickle-shaped, evergreen phyllodes (to 6” long and 1” wide) rather than leaves.  Phyllodes are modified leaf stems that function as leaves.  The true leaves of this tree (each with 12 to 15 paired, twice compound, pea-like leaflets) are only found on juvenile saplings.  Pale yellow flowers with globose heads (each to 3/8” in diameter) bloom in axillary racemes over the outer part of the crown.  Bloom time depends upon a number of factors including elevation, weather conditions and soil moisture.  Flowers may appear year round in some locations or late winter to early summer in others.  Flowers give way to thin, flat, seed pods (about 3-7” long and 1” wide) which mature to brown.  Each pod contains around 12 seeds. 

Koa is the best known timber tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.  Early Hawaiians made long dugout canoes from the wood of tall trees.  Wood is currently used for a variety of other purposes including furniture, cabinets, veneers, wood carvings, musical instruments and picture frames.  Timber from this tree is sometimes called Hawaiian mahogany in honor of its decorative wood (beautifully grained in shades of red, golden brown and brown).  It is one of the most expensive woods in the world today (low supply translates into high cost).  Most commercial harvest of Koa trees is currently limited to the island of Hawaii.  Timber cutting, land clearing and introduced pests have contributed to the decline of this species in the Hawaiian Islands.Genus name come from the Greek name for Acacia arabica.Specific epithet is a native Hawaiian name meaning bold, brave and fearless.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problem. Koa moth can be destructive.  Watch for twig borers, fungi and koa wilt.
","
Garden Uses
Interesting landscape tree for subtropical areas.  Has been successfully grown in a number of California areas.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10 to 11. In its native area, it tolerates a wide range of soil conditions from acidic to slightly alkaline and will grow in sand, loam or clay. It has moderate drought tolerance and poor salt tolerance and will grow in full sun to part shade. In the St. Louis area, it must be grown in containers which can be placed outside on decks and patios during warm weather or it can be grown indoors year-round in an area that receives bright, indirect light. When placed outside, avoid direct afternoon sun. In winter, plants benefit from misting to maintain higher humidity levels, but do not spray flowers. They are relatively trouble free, but watch for mealybugs, red spider mites and scale. Prune severely to 4 to 8 inches in spring to encourage new growth and increased bloom; remove spent flowers. Indoors, keep soil moderately moist, but not soggy. Feed monthly from March to September.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acalypha hispida, commonly called chenille plant, is a beautiful flowering plant that has a long bloom period. The flowers, which droop in cattail-like pendent clusters up to 18 inches in length are bright red to deep pink. In zones 10 to 11 it is a vigorous, upright, coarse-textured shrub that usually attains a height of 5 to 6 feet that is commonly used as an accent, hedge, specimen or container plant. In St. Louis, it is a good container, hanging basket and greenhouse plant, when taken indoors in the fall. Its long period of bloom makes it a showy centerpiece for any tropical or subtropical garden. It features leaves that are 6 to 8 inches long, ovate and medium green.Genus name comes from the Greek name for nettles because of the nettle-like appearance of the leaves.Specific epithet means bristly in probable reference to the bristly nature of the leaves. Another common name for this species is bristly copperleaf.
","
Problems
For best indoor success, very high humidity should be maintained. Also, spider mites, mealybugs and scale may be a problem when grown indoors. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In St. Louis, grow in containers or baskets on decks, patios or rooftop gardens. It is a good plant for color and should be used as an accent for both color and texture in a container. Or, it can be grown year-round in a greenhouse or sun room giving the area a tropical feel.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10. In St. Louis, best grown as annual bedding plants or in containers which can be overwintered indoors. In the ground, grow in moist, average to moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage color in full sun. Soils must be kept consistently moist. If soils dry out, rapid leaf drop usually occurs. Stems may be pinched to control size and shape and to promote bushiness. Take tip cuttings in late summer to overwinter. Container plants may also be overwintered as houseplants as long as they receive intense bright light and soils are kept uniformly moist.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acalypha wilkesiana is native to Fiji and neighboring South Pacific islands. It is an evergreen, often suckering, tropical shrub or subshrub that may grow to 10-15’ tall and as wide in frost free areas. It is typically grown as an annual in St. Louis where it will grow 2-4’ tall in a single growing season. As the common name suggests, this shrub is grown for its attractive foliage which features shiny, coarsely-toothed, oval to elliptic, bronze-green leaves (5-8” long) that are mottled with red and purple or red and bronze. Insignificant green flowers, sometimes tinged with reddish-pink, appear in slender spikes to 8” long. 

Synonymous with A. tricolor.Genus name comes from the Greek name for nettles because of the nettle-like appearance of the leaves.Specific epithet honors Admiral Charles Wilkes who explored the South Pacific in the 1800s.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in average, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants tolerate a wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones. Plants may not flower well in too much shade. Late spring frosts can impair or eliminate flowering for the year. Remove flowering stalks after bloom. In cold winter areas, plant foliage should be left in place over winter but removed in early spring as new foliage appears. Plants can spread aggressively by creeping rootstocks, particularly in loose soils. Unwanted spread can be addressed by root barriers. Plants generally spread less in the northern parts of their growing range. Plants are best propagated from root cuttings taken in early spring, but may be grown from seed. Plants can be slow to establish in the garden (particularly if started from seed), but become somewhat difficult to eradicate once established since small sections of root left behind can sprout new plants. This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area. If attempted in St. Louis, it should be sited in a protected location and mulched.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acanthus mollis, commonly known as bear’s breeches, is a clump-forming perennial that is grown as much for its attractive foliage as for its architecturally bold flower spikes.  It is native to the Mediterranean region.  Creamy white (sometimes pink) snapdragon-like flowers, each hooded and subtended by spiny reddish-purple bracts, bloom in late spring to midsummer in vertical rows on substantial flower spikes that rise well above the foliage mound to 3-5’ tall.  Deeply lobed, soft-spiny, glossy, dark green leaves (to 2’ long) form a mound of basal foliage.  Foliage is mostly evergreen in warm winter climates, but plants lose their leaves when winter temperatures dip below 20 degrees F.  

Acanthus leaves have a classical appearance and were the source of the Corinthian leaf motif developed and used as a decoration in ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture.  It is believed that the leaves of A. mollis or A. spinosis were the model for the sculptured leaves that adorn the capitals of the Corinthian columns that became popular in the 4th century B.C.Genus name comes from the Greek word akantha meaning spine in reference to the toothed edges on leaves in some species.Specific epithet means with soft hairs.There appears to be no scholarly agreement among authorities on the origin and meaning of the term bear’s breeches.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Snails and slugs are occasional visitors that can do substantial damage if left unchecked. Plants can spread aggressively in optimum conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Bold, stately plants that may be grown as specimens but are perhaps best in small groupings. Borders or formal gardens. For the St. Louis area, A. spinosus is a similar plant with better winter hardiness.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. Not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where a winter mulch is advisable. Easily grown from seed or may be propagated by root cuttings best taken in early spring. Can spread aggressively by creeping rootstocks, particularly in loose soils. Can be slow to establish in the garden, but somewhat difficult to eradicate once established since small sections of root left behind can sprout new plants.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acanthus spinosus, commonly called bear's breeches, is a clump-forming perennial which is grown as much for its attractive foliage as for its architecturally bold flower spikes. Features pure white, snapdragon-like flowers enclosed (hooded and subtended) by spiny, reddish-purple bracts and arranged in vertical rows on substantial flower spikes which rise well above the foliage mound to 3-4' tall. Blooms from late spring into mid summer. Deeply-cut, arching, glossy green, spiny, thistle-like leaves (2-3' long) form an ornamental mound of long-stalked, basal foliage which usually remains attractive throughout the growing season. Similar in appearance to Acanthus hungaricus ( A. balcanicus), except the leaves of A. spinosus are more deeply cut and have rigid spines (hence the species name) at the lobe tips. 

Acanthus leaves have a classical appearance and were the source of the Corinthian leaf motif developed and used as a decoration in ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture.Genus name comes from the Greek word akantha meaning spine in reference to the toothed edges on leaves in some species.Specific epithet means spiny in reference to the rigid spines on the leaves.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10. In St. Louis, best grown as annual bedding plants or in containers which can be overwintered indoors. In the ground, grow in moist, average to moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage color in full sun. Soils must be kept consistently moist. If soils dry out, rapid leaf drop usually occurs. Stems may be pinched to control size and shape and to promote bushiness. Take tip cuttings in late summer to overwinter. Container plants may also be overwintered as houseplants as long as they receive intense bright light and soils are kept uniformly moist.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acalypha wilkesiana is native to Fiji and neighboring South Pacific islands. It is an evergreen, often suckering, tropical shrub or subshrub that may grow to 10-15’ tall and as wide in frost free areas. It is typically grown as an annual in St. Louis where it will grow 2-4’ tall in a single growing season. As the common name suggests, this shrub is grown for its attractive foliage which features shiny, coarsely-toothed, oval to elliptic, bronze-green leaves (5-8” long) that are mottled with red and purple or red and bronze. Insignificant green flowers, sometimes tinged with reddish-pink, appear in slender spikes to 8” long. 

Synonymous with A. tricolor.Genus name comes from the Greek name for nettles because of the nettle-like appearance of the leaves.Specific epithet honors Admiral Charles Wilkes who explored the South Pacific in the 1800s.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in average, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants tolerate a wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones. Plants may not flower well in too much shade. Late spring frosts can impair or eliminate flowering for the year. Remove flowering stalks after bloom. In cold winter areas, plant foliage should be left in place over winter but removed in early spring as new foliage appears. Plants can spread aggressively by creeping rootstocks, particularly in loose soils. Unwanted spread can be addressed by root barriers. Plants generally spread less in the northern parts of their growing range. Plants are best propagated from root cuttings taken in early spring, but may be grown from seed. Plants can be slow to establish in the garden (particularly if started from seed), but become somewhat difficult to eradicate once established since small sections of root left behind can sprout new plants. This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area. If attempted in St. Louis, it should be sited in a protected location and mulched.

Acanthus mollis, commonly known as bear’s breeches, is a clump-forming perennial that is grown as much for its attractive foliage as for its architecturally bold flower spikes.  It is native to the Mediterranean region.  Creamy white (sometimes pink) snapdragon-like flowers, each hooded and subtended by spiny reddish-purple bracts, bloom in late spring to midsummer in vertical rows on substantial flower spikes that rise well above the foliage mound to 3-5’ tall.  Deeply lobed, soft-spiny, glossy, dark green leaves (to 2’ long) form a mound of basal foliage.  Foliage is mostly evergreen in warm winter climates, but plants lose their leaves when winter temperatures dip below 20 degrees F.  

Acanthus leaves have a classical appearance and were the source of the Corinthian leaf motif developed and used as a decoration in ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture.  It is believed that the leaves of A. mollis or A. spinosis were the model for the sculptured leaves that adorn the capitals of the Corinthian columns that became popular in the 4th century B.C.Genus name comes from the Greek word akantha meaning spine in reference to the toothed edges on leaves in some species.Specific epithet means with soft hairs.There appears to be no scholarly agreement among authorities on the origin and meaning of the term bear’s breeches.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Snails and slugs are occasional visitors that can do substantial damage if left unchecked. Plants can spread aggressively in optimum conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Bold, stately plants that may be grown as specimens but are perhaps best in small groupings. Borders or formal gardens. For the St. Louis area, A. spinosus is a similar plant with better winter hardiness.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. Not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where a winter mulch is advisable. Easily grown from seed or may be propagated by root cuttings best taken in early spring. Can spread aggressively by creeping rootstocks, particularly in loose soils. Can be slow to establish in the garden, but somewhat difficult to eradicate once established since small sections of root left behind can sprout new plants.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acanthus spinosus, commonly called bear's breeches, is a clump-forming perennial which is grown as much for its attractive foliage as for its architecturally bold flower spikes. Features pure white, snapdragon-like flowers enclosed (hooded and subtended) by spiny, reddish-purple bracts and arranged in vertical rows on substantial flower spikes which rise well above the foliage mound to 3-4' tall. Blooms from late spring into mid summer. Deeply-cut, arching, glossy green, spiny, thistle-like leaves (2-3' long) form an ornamental mound of long-stalked, basal foliage which usually remains attractive throughout the growing season. Similar in appearance to Acanthus hungaricus ( A. balcanicus), except the leaves of A. spinosus are more deeply cut and have rigid spines (hence the species name) at the lobe tips. 

Acanthus leaves have a classical appearance and were the source of the Corinthian leaf motif developed and used as a decoration in ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture.Genus name comes from the Greek word akantha meaning spine in reference to the toothed edges on leaves in some species.Specific epithet means spiny in reference to the rigid spines on the leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in average, slightly acidic, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, well-drained soils.  Intolerant of drought.  Propagation is difficult (approximately 95% of seed produced is not viable).  Woody cuttings are difficult to root, but juvenile cuttings are easier to root.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer griseum, commonly called paperbark maple, is a small, deciduous, oval to oval-rounded tree with slender upright branching.  It is particularly noted for its exfoliating copper orange to cinnamon reddish/brown bark and its showy orange to red fall color.  It typically matures to 20-30 (40)’ tall.  It is native to mixed forests in central China.  Bark on the trunk and limbs is extremely ornamental because it peels into large curls which remain on the tree rather that falling to the ground, often in attractive contrast to the tan to rose-brown inner bark.  Each trifoliate leaf (3-5” long) features three coarsely toothed leaflets, with the middle leaflet being short-stalked.  Leaves are green above, but frosty blue-green to gray-green with fine hairs beneath.  Fall color varies, typically ranging from showy shades of orange and red to less spectacular shades of reddish-green to bronze green.  Ornamentally insignificant yellowish flowers bloom in April-early May in clusters (drooping cymes to 1” long) on pendulous downy stalks.  Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1 1/4” long) with unusually large seeds.

E. H. (“Chinese”) Wilson brought this tree from China to England in 1899.  It was introduced in the U. S. shortly thereafter by the Arnold Arboretum.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word griseus meaning gray in reference to color of the leaf undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent small tree for small properties.  Deserves a location where its ornamental features can be appreciated (near a deck or patio).  Appropriate as an understory tree in a woodland garden or as a specimen in many locations around the home.  Popular bonsai subject, particularly in Europe.

Plants prefer cool summer conditions.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Stake young trees for more erect growth.  Plants perform poorly south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer japonicum, commonly called full moon maple, is a deciduous, spreading, small tree or large shrub that grows to 20-30’ tall.  It often grows in a multi-trunked form.  It is native to mountainous areas of Japan, Manchuria and Korea.  It features rounded, palmate, almost fern-like, medium green leaves (to 3-6” across) which are deeply divided (approximately 1/3 of distance to the leaf base) into 7-11 acuminate, toothed and cut, ovate to lance-shaped lobes.  Leaves turn yellow and red in fall.  Each rounded leaf purportedly resembles a full moon, hence the common name.  Small purplish-red flowers in pendulous corymbs appear in early spring (April) before the leaves.  Flowers are followed by winged samaras (to 1” long) which ripen in late summer to early fall.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet indicates native to Japan.Species plants are rarely offered in cultivation, but several popular cultivars are commonly sold, including ‘Aconitifolium’ and 'Vitifolium'.
","
Problems
Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late frosts.  Susceptible to verticillium wilt, leaf spots, root rots, anthracnose, collar rot and stem canker.  Potential insect pests include aphids, scale, borers and caterpillars.  Mites may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Grown primarily as a specimen or in small groups around the home, patio or yard. Vigorous understory tree featuring attractive foliage and stunning fall color.

Culture
Easily grown in moist, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, well-drained soils in cool summer temperatures reminiscent of those typically found in its native environment in the Pacific Northwest, but tolerates a variety of soil conditions ranging from moist to somewhat dry.   Does not always perform well in the hot and humid summer conditions found in the southeastern U.S. where it is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer macrophyllum, commonly called bigleaf maple or Oregon maple, is a medium to large, deciduous tree with an oval to broad-rounded crown that typically grows to 40-75’ tall, but occasionally soars to 100’ tall.  Overall, it is considered to be the most massive of the various species of maple found in North America.  Gray to reddish-brown bark on mature trees is deeply furrowed.  It is native to moist to dry sites from British Columbia to southern California, most commonly being found in moist woods and along streams in the lower elevations of the coastal ranges and northern Sierra Nevada mountains.  This tree is rarely found growing more than 200 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.  Trees in moist forested areas in western parts of the Pacific Northwest are often covered with mosses, lichens and ferns.  

Deeply 5-lobed (occasionally 3-lobed) leaves (to 8-12” long and wide) emerge with burgundy tones in spring, mature to glossy medium to deep green, and finally turn yellow to yellow-orange in fall. Leaves found on this tree are the largest found on any species of maple, hence the common name of big leaf maple.  Leaf stalks contain a milky sap.  Fragrant greenish-yellow flowers (each to 1/3” across) bloom in April-May in 4-8” long pendant, cylindrical, chain-like clusters (racemes), with each cluster having up to 175 tiny flowers.  Flowers bloom as the new burgundy-tinted leaves are developing, providing an often attractive color contrast.  Flowers give way to two-winged samaras (each to 1 1/2” long) with wings spreading to 60 degrees.  Samaras mature by autumn.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and phyllon meaning leaf in obvious reference to the huge leaves found on this tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Powdery mildew and verticillium wilt can pose problems in some areas.  Shallow spreading roots can crack sidewalks and driveways.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent shade tree for large landscapes and parks.  Wood is commercially used for lumber and to make furniture, veneer, cabinets, paneling and floors.  Saplings make excellent browse for deer and elk.  Seeds are eaten by chipmunks, squirrels, mice and some birds.   Sap may be used to make maple syrup, however in order to produce a given volume of syrup, a  much larger amount of sap must be taken from this tree than from Acer saccharum (the sugar maple of Eastern North America) which has a much larger concentration of sugar in its sap.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor dry ones. Intolerant of shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer negundo, commonly known as box elder, is a suckering, fast-growing, weak-wooded, medium-sized, deciduous tree that typically grows 30-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with an irregular rounded crown.  It is widely distributed throughout the U.S. except in Alaska and Hawaii.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams, river flood plains and low woods (Steyermark).  Although it is a maple and produces the familiar maple fruits (paired samaras), it differs from most maples by having odd-pinnate compound leaves (each with 3-5 toothed leaflets) and by being dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Leaves with three leaflets are most common, and these resemble poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).  Leaves are light to medium green, turning an undistinguished yellow in fall.  Greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendant clusters in spring on separate male and female trees. Flowers are not showy.  Female flowers give way to fruits (samaras) which mature in fall and often persist on the tree well into winter.  Fruiting can be abundant.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Sanskrit and Bengali word nirgundi, which was used as negundo in the naming of Vitex negundo and later for this maple that has a leaf similar to that of Vitex negundo.The name box elder (sometimes boxelder) is in reference to a use of the wood for making crates and boxes and the supposed similarity of the leaves to those of elder (Sambucus). Leaves also resemble those of some ashes, hence the additional common name of ash-leaved maple.
","
Problems
This tree is a host for boxelder bugs, which do not harm the tree but can be a significant nuisance to homeowners if the tree is located near the home. Also susceptible to borers. Anthracnose, powdery mildew and canker are occasional disease problems. Weak-wooded branches may break in high winds or from the weight of ice/snow, sometimes severely damaging the shape of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Could be used as a shade tree. Generally recommended only for difficult corners of the landscape where other trees of superior ornamental value will not grow or in cold northern climates such as North Dakota where many deciduous shade trees are hard to grow. Male trees are generally considered to be superior landscape plants to female trees because they lack the messy flowers and somewhat unsightly seed clusters of the female trees.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in sandy loams.  May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range.  New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist.  Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Avoid hot and dry sites.  Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge.  Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter.  Spring or summer pruning often  results in significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching.  Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes.  Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April).  The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance.  Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs.  Samaras ripen in September-October.  Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze.  Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.
","
Problems
Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots.  Potential insect pests include  aphids, scale, borers, bagworms, and root weevils.  Mites may be troublesome.  Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late spring frosts.  Chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.
","
Garden Uses
Japanese maples are generally grown for their attractive foliage and shape.  Specimen/accent or group around the home or yard or periphery of the border.  Good sun-dappled understory tree.  Woodland garden margins.  Screen.  Bonsai.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade. Excellent shade tolerance. Plants dislike full sun conditions. Slightly acidic, consistently moist soils are preferred. Best performance occurs in cool summer climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer pensylvanicum commonly known as snakebark maple is a shrubby understory maple that is native to moist, rocky forests from Wisconsin to Quebec and south in the Appalachians to Georgia. It typically grows as a large shrub or small tree to 15-25’ tall (less frequently to 40’ tall) with a rounded but uneven crown that is sometimes flat-topped. This is the only species of snakebark maple that is native to North America. Key ornamental features are its interesting bark and fall color. Greenish bark on young branches and young trunks is vertically marked with distinctive white stripes (hence the common names of snakebark maple and striped maple). Stripes may vanish over time as older bark turns reddish brown. Obovate, double-serrulate, three-lobed leaves (to 7” long) emerge with pink hues in spring, mature to dark green by summer and turn bright yellow in fall. Leaf purportedly resembles a goose foot, hence the common name of goosefoot maple for this plant. Small yellow flowers (1/3” diameter) bloom in pendant racemes (to 6” long) in spring (May). Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1” long). Moose and white tailed deer often browse the leaves and young twigs hence the common name of moosewood. Whistles can easily be carved from branch sections, hence the common name of whistlewood.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Although misspelled by Linnaeus, the specific epithet is in fact a reference to the State of Pennsylvania where this tree is native.
","
Problems
Leaves may scorch in full sun locations. Potential disease problems include verticillium wilt, leaf spots, tar spot, canker and root rots. Potential insect problems include aphids, scale, borers and caterpillars. Mites may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Fall color and striped bark (particularly in winter) are attractive. Perhaps best for woodland gardens or shaded naturalized areas.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Tolerant of heat and drought. Generally tolerant of many urban pollutants. Freely reseeds. Trees have escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S. Shallow root system.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer platanoides, commonly called Norway maple, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in urban areas throughout much of the U.S. It is a medium-sized deciduous shade tree typically growing 40-50’ tall with a dense, symmetrical, rounded crown. Leaves (to 7” across) have five sharply pointed lobes and resemble those of sugar maple. Leaf stems exude a milky sap when cut. Fall color is usually an unremarkable yellow. Small yellow flowers in erect clusters (corymbs) appear in spring before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired seeds with horizontally spreading wings (samaras to 2” long).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means resembling platanus (sycamore), which is somewhat curious since the leaves of Norway maple do not really bear that much resemblance to sycamores.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt which is usually fatal. Shallow root system can crack or heave nearby driveways or sidewalks. Shallow surface roots can interfere with turf. Bark is susceptible to sunscald and cracking (frost cracks) in winter, particularly on younger trees. The thick canopy of leaves and shallow roots severely limits what can be grown within the drip line of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Shade tree. Although once widely planted as a street tree, this use is not generally recommended in many areas now.

Samaras mature in early autumn.  Bark on mature trunks will flake, exposing inner orange bark.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means false sycamore (pseudo meaning false and platanus being the genus for sycamore).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Canker is the most significant potential disease problem.
","
Garden Uses
This may not be the best selection for the landscape since it is not particularly ornamental and has poor fall color. It may be used as a shade tree. It is often planted along the east coast because of its tolerance for salt spray.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer rubrum, commonly called red maple, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Eastern North America from Quebec to Minnesota south to Florida and eastern Texas.  It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a rounded to oval crown.  It grows faster than Norway and sugar maples, but slower than silver maple.  In northern states, red maple usually occurs in wet bottomland, river flood plains and wet woods, but in Missouri it typically frequents drier, rocky upland areas.  Emerging new growth leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit and fall color are red or tinged with red.  Quality of red fall color on species plants is variable.  Leaves (to 2-5"" long) have 3 principal triangular lobes (sometimes 5 lobes with the two lower lobes being largely suppressed).  Lobes have toothed margins and pointed tips.  Leaves are medium to dark green above and gray green below.  Flowers on a given tree are primarily male or female or monoecious and appear in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves.  Fruit is a two-winged samara.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet of rubrum meaning red is everywhere in evidence: red flowers in dense clusters in late March to early April (before the leaves appear), red fruit (initially reddish, two-winged samara), reddish stems and twigs, red buds, and, in the fall, excellent orange-red foliage color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, leafhoppers, borers, scale and caterpillars.  Verticillium wilt attacks the vascular system and can be fatal.  Canker, fungal leaf spot and root rots may also occur.  Wind and ice may break some branches. Leaf hoppers can cause substantial damage.
","
Garden Uses
Plant as a specimen tree for the lawn, street or park. It is of note that this tree has a shallow, flattened root system that may buckle nearby sidewalks or driveways if planted too close.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharinum commonly known as silver maple gets its name from the silvery undersides of its leaves. This is one of the largest deciduous trees native to Missouri, typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a rounded open spreading crown. It is native to eastern and central North America where it typically occurs in moist to wet, sometimes mucky, often poorly drained soils on floodplains, along the edges of streams and rivers and in low woods. It is a fast-growing, somewhat graceful tree that formerly was a very popular urban landscape selection for lawns and streets, but has more recently fallen somewhat out of favor because of the proclivity of its weak-wooded limbs to split when stressed by high winds or ice/snow. Polygamous greenish yellow flowers bloom in clusters in early spring (March) before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired samaras (to 2” long) that mature in late spring. Bark is gray to brownish gray. Mature tree trunks and limbs develop a shaggy appearance as the bark develops long thin flaky scales that exfoliate at the ends. Deeply 5-lobed light green leaves (to 6” across) have silvery undersides. Fall color is usually unremarkable. Tree sap is sweet, hence the species name which comes from the Latin word for sugar, but syrups made therefrom are greatly inferior to those made from sugar maple (Acer saccharum).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose and canker. Also susceptible to scale and borers. As with many fast growing trees, silver maple has weak brittle branches that are susceptible to breaking in high winds or when coated with ice/snow in winter. Shallow roots may damage nearby sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful large landscape tree. Weak wood is a concern. Perhaps best sited in areas of poor soil or low wet conditions where other stronger wooded trees will not grow.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharum commonly known as sugar maple is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which will typically grow 40' to 80' tall (sometimes to 100') with a dense, rounded crown. This tree is a main component of the Eastern U.S. hardwood forest and is one of the trees which is most responsible for giving New England its reputation for spectacular fall color. Medium green leaves (3-6"" wide with 3-5 lobes) turn yellow-orange in autumn, sometimes with considerable color variations. Fruit is the familiar two-winged samara. Sugar maples are long-lived trees which grow relatively slowly (somewhat faster in the first 35 years). Native Americans taught the early colonists how to tap these trees to make maple syrup which has now become a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and Canada. Excellent shade tree.  The sugar maple leaf is the national symbol of Canada.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap. Saccharum is the genus name for sugarcane.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose, cankers, leaf spot and tar spot. Also susceptible to aphids, borers and scale. Leaf scorch may be a problem in drought conditions. Has been frequently used as a street tree, but is generally intolerant of road salt, soil compaction and pollution.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer tataricum, commonly called Tatarian maple, typically grows as a small, upright spreading tree with a dense, rounded crown or as a large multi-stemmed shrub.  It matures over time to 15-20’ tall.  It is native to forested areas from western Asia to southeastern Europe.  Unlobed, broad-ovate, medium green leaves (to 4” long) with irregular doubly serrate margins are found on mature trees.  Leaves on young trees are often 3 lobed.  Leaves turn yellow and red in fall.  Greenish-white flowers in erect, long-peduncled panicles bloom in spring.  Flowers are followed by winged samaras (to 1” long) that turn a showy red in summer/fall as they mature.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to certain areas of Siberia and Mongolia (Tatary) that were invaded and occupied in the Middle Ages by the Tatars.Acer tataricum subsp. ginnala and its cultivars are more often found in cultivation than A. tataricum.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Verticillium wilt, stem canker, leaf spots, tar spot and anthracnose may appear. Watch for aphids, borers, scale, leafhoppers, caterpillers and mites. Plants have escaped cultivation and naturalized by self-seeding in certain parts of the eastern U.S.

Best grown in lean, dry to medium moisture, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Avoid heavy clays and moist, rich, fertile soils. Plants will tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. Plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Consider cutting back plant stems to lateral flower buds after initial flowering to tidy the planting and to encourage additional bloom. Plants may be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain the vitality of the planting. Plants will slowly spread in the garden over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea aegyptiaca var. taygetea (synonymous with and formerly known as Achillea 'Taygetea') is a clump-forming yarrow that is noted for its deeply-dissected, fern-like, gray-green leaves and its tiny, long-lasting, bright yellow flowers. Flowers gradually fade to primrose yellow as they age. Flowers appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) from early to late summer on stems typically rising to 16-24” tall.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.This yarrow is one of the parents of the Galaxy hybrid yarrows and of Achillea 'Moonshine'.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can damage exposed plantings. If stems flop or become matted, they can be cut back.
","
Garden Uses

Plants also tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. If grown ornamentally, plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens. Cultivars also extend the range of flower colors to include pinks, reds, creams, yellows and bicolor pastels.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.The specific epithet millefolium means ""thousand-leaved"" in reference to the highly dissected foliage.Common yarrow has a large number of additional common names, including milfoil, thousandleaf, soldier’s woundwort, bloodwort, nose bleed, devil’s nettle, sanguinary, old-man’s-pepper and stenchgrass.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Plant stems are weak and lodge easily. If grown ornamentally, plants can develop into a tangled mass of stems and foliage by mid to late summer if not cut back. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can easily flatten exposed plantings. May spread somewhat aggressively.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, wild gardens, meadows, prairies and naturalized areas. Good fresh cut or dried flower.This species is generally considered to be too weedy for borders. Can be used as a flowering ground cover or lawn for sunny out-of-the-way areas (mow as needed with rotary mower on high setting).

Propagation is difficult (approximately 95% of seed produced is not viable).  Woody cuttings are difficult to root, but juvenile cuttings are easier to root.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer griseum, commonly called paperbark maple, is a small, deciduous, oval to oval-rounded tree with slender upright branching.  It is particularly noted for its exfoliating copper orange to cinnamon reddish/brown bark and its showy orange to red fall color.  It typically matures to 20-30 (40)’ tall.  It is native to mixed forests in central China.  Bark on the trunk and limbs is extremely ornamental because it peels into large curls which remain on the tree rather that falling to the ground, often in attractive contrast to the tan to rose-brown inner bark.  Each trifoliate leaf (3-5” long) features three coarsely toothed leaflets, with the middle leaflet being short-stalked.  Leaves are green above, but frosty blue-green to gray-green with fine hairs beneath.  Fall color varies, typically ranging from showy shades of orange and red to less spectacular shades of reddish-green to bronze green.  Ornamentally insignificant yellowish flowers bloom in April-early May in clusters (drooping cymes to 1” long) on pendulous downy stalks.  Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1 1/4” long) with unusually large seeds.

E. H. (“Chinese”) Wilson brought this tree from China to England in 1899.  It was introduced in the U. S. shortly thereafter by the Arnold Arboretum.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word griseus meaning gray in reference to color of the leaf undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent small tree for small properties.  Deserves a location where its ornamental features can be appreciated (near a deck or patio).  Appropriate as an understory tree in a woodland garden or as a specimen in many locations around the home.  Popular bonsai subject, particularly in Europe.

Does not always perform well in the hot and humid summer conditions found in the southeastern U.S. where it is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer macrophyllum, commonly called bigleaf maple or Oregon maple, is a medium to large, deciduous tree with an oval to broad-rounded crown that typically grows to 40-75’ tall, but occasionally soars to 100’ tall.  Overall, it is considered to be the most massive of the various species of maple found in North America.  Gray to reddish-brown bark on mature trees is deeply furrowed.  It is native to moist to dry sites from British Columbia to southern California, most commonly being found in moist woods and along streams in the lower elevations of the coastal ranges and northern Sierra Nevada mountains.  This tree is rarely found growing more than 200 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.  Trees in moist forested areas in western parts of the Pacific Northwest are often covered with mosses, lichens and ferns.  

Deeply 5-lobed (occasionally 3-lobed) leaves (to 8-12” long and wide) emerge with burgundy tones in spring, mature to glossy medium to deep green, and finally turn yellow to yellow-orange in fall. Leaves found on this tree are the largest found on any species of maple, hence the common name of big leaf maple.  Leaf stalks contain a milky sap.  Fragrant greenish-yellow flowers (each to 1/3” across) bloom in April-May in 4-8” long pendant, cylindrical, chain-like clusters (racemes), with each cluster having up to 175 tiny flowers.  Flowers bloom as the new burgundy-tinted leaves are developing, providing an often attractive color contrast.  Flowers give way to two-winged samaras (each to 1 1/2” long) with wings spreading to 60 degrees.  Samaras mature by autumn.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and phyllon meaning leaf in obvious reference to the huge leaves found on this tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Powdery mildew and verticillium wilt can pose problems in some areas.  Shallow spreading roots can crack sidewalks and driveways.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent shade tree for large landscapes and parks.  Wood is commercially used for lumber and to make furniture, veneer, cabinets, paneling and floors.  Saplings make excellent browse for deer and elk.  Seeds are eaten by chipmunks, squirrels, mice and some birds.   Sap may be used to make maple syrup, however in order to produce a given volume of syrup, a  much larger amount of sap must be taken from this tree than from Acer saccharum (the sugar maple of Eastern North America) which has a much larger concentration of sugar in its sap.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor dry ones. Intolerant of shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer negundo, commonly known as box elder, is a suckering, fast-growing, weak-wooded, medium-sized, deciduous tree that typically grows 30-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with an irregular rounded crown.  It is widely distributed throughout the U.S. except in Alaska and Hawaii.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams, river flood plains and low woods (Steyermark).  Although it is a maple and produces the familiar maple fruits (paired samaras), it differs from most maples by having odd-pinnate compound leaves (each with 3-5 toothed leaflets) and by being dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Leaves with three leaflets are most common, and these resemble poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).  Leaves are light to medium green, turning an undistinguished yellow in fall.  Greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendant clusters in spring on separate male and female trees. Flowers are not showy.  Female flowers give way to fruits (samaras) which mature in fall and often persist on the tree well into winter.  Fruiting can be abundant.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Sanskrit and Bengali word nirgundi, which was used as negundo in the naming of Vitex negundo and later for this maple that has a leaf similar to that of Vitex negundo.The name box elder (sometimes boxelder) is in reference to a use of the wood for making crates and boxes and the supposed similarity of the leaves to those of elder (Sambucus). Leaves also resemble those of some ashes, hence the additional common name of ash-leaved maple.
","
Problems
This tree is a host for boxelder bugs, which do not harm the tree but can be a significant nuisance to homeowners if the tree is located near the home. Also susceptible to borers. Anthracnose, powdery mildew and canker are occasional disease problems. Weak-wooded branches may break in high winds or from the weight of ice/snow, sometimes severely damaging the shape of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Could be used as a shade tree. Generally recommended only for difficult corners of the landscape where other trees of superior ornamental value will not grow or in cold northern climates such as North Dakota where many deciduous shade trees are hard to grow. Male trees are generally considered to be superior landscape plants to female trees because they lack the messy flowers and somewhat unsightly seed clusters of the female trees.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in sandy loams.  May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range.  New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist.  Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Avoid hot and dry sites.  Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge.  Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter.  Spring or summer pruning often  results in significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching.  Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes.  Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April).  The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance.  Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs.  Samaras ripen in September-October.  Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze.  Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.
","
Problems
Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots.  Potential insect pests include  aphids, scale, borers, bagworms, and root weevils.  Mites may be troublesome.  Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late spring frosts.  Chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer pensylvanicum commonly known as snakebark maple is a shrubby understory maple that is native to moist, rocky forests from Wisconsin to Quebec and south in the Appalachians to Georgia. It typically grows as a large shrub or small tree to 15-25’ tall (less frequently to 40’ tall) with a rounded but uneven crown that is sometimes flat-topped. This is the only species of snakebark maple that is native to North America. Key ornamental features are its interesting bark and fall color. Greenish bark on young branches and young trunks is vertically marked with distinctive white stripes (hence the common names of snakebark maple and striped maple). Stripes may vanish over time as older bark turns reddish brown. Obovate, double-serrulate, three-lobed leaves (to 7” long) emerge with pink hues in spring, mature to dark green by summer and turn bright yellow in fall. Leaf purportedly resembles a goose foot, hence the common name of goosefoot maple for this plant. Small yellow flowers (1/3” diameter) bloom in pendant racemes (to 6” long) in spring (May). Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1” long). Moose and white tailed deer often browse the leaves and young twigs hence the common name of moosewood. Whistles can easily be carved from branch sections, hence the common name of whistlewood.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Although misspelled by Linnaeus, the specific epithet is in fact a reference to the State of Pennsylvania where this tree is native.
","
Problems
Leaves may scorch in full sun locations. Potential disease problems include verticillium wilt, leaf spots, tar spot, canker and root rots. Potential insect problems include aphids, scale, borers and caterpillars. Mites may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Fall color and striped bark (particularly in winter) are attractive. Perhaps best for woodland gardens or shaded naturalized areas.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Tolerant of heat and drought. Generally tolerant of many urban pollutants. Freely reseeds. Trees have escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S. Shallow root system.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer platanoides, commonly called Norway maple, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in urban areas throughout much of the U.S. It is a medium-sized deciduous shade tree typically growing 40-50’ tall with a dense, symmetrical, rounded crown. Leaves (to 7” across) have five sharply pointed lobes and resemble those of sugar maple. Leaf stems exude a milky sap when cut. Fall color is usually an unremarkable yellow. Small yellow flowers in erect clusters (corymbs) appear in spring before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired seeds with horizontally spreading wings (samaras to 2” long).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means resembling platanus (sycamore), which is somewhat curious since the leaves of Norway maple do not really bear that much resemblance to sycamores.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt which is usually fatal. Shallow root system can crack or heave nearby driveways or sidewalks. Shallow surface roots can interfere with turf. Bark is susceptible to sunscald and cracking (frost cracks) in winter, particularly on younger trees. The thick canopy of leaves and shallow roots severely limits what can be grown within the drip line of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Shade tree. Although once widely planted as a street tree, this use is not generally recommended in many areas now.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer pseudoplatanus, commonly called sycamore maple or planetree maple, is native to northwest/central Europe and western Asia.  It is a rounded, spreading, deciduous tree that grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 100’) tall.  Leathery, coarsely-serrate, prominently-veined, 5-lobed, dark green leaves (to 6” across) are dull green beneath.  Leaves produce no fall color.  Yellow-green flowers appear in panicles (to 5” long) in spring after the foliage emerges.  Flowers are followed by pairs of samaras (to 2” long) with the wings typically forming a 60 degree angle.  Samaras mature in early autumn.  Bark on mature trunks will flake, exposing inner orange bark.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means false sycamore (pseudo meaning false and platanus being the genus for sycamore).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Canker is the most significant potential disease problem.
","
Garden Uses
This may not be the best selection for the landscape since it is not particularly ornamental and has poor fall color. It may be used as a shade tree. It is often planted along the east coast because of its tolerance for salt spray.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer rubrum, commonly called red maple, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Eastern North America from Quebec to Minnesota south to Florida and eastern Texas.  It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a rounded to oval crown.  It grows faster than Norway and sugar maples, but slower than silver maple.  In northern states, red maple usually occurs in wet bottomland, river flood plains and wet woods, but in Missouri it typically frequents drier, rocky upland areas.  Emerging new growth leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit and fall color are red or tinged with red.  Quality of red fall color on species plants is variable.  Leaves (to 2-5"" long) have 3 principal triangular lobes (sometimes 5 lobes with the two lower lobes being largely suppressed).  Lobes have toothed margins and pointed tips.  Leaves are medium to dark green above and gray green below.  Flowers on a given tree are primarily male or female or monoecious and appear in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves.  Fruit is a two-winged samara.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet of rubrum meaning red is everywhere in evidence: red flowers in dense clusters in late March to early April (before the leaves appear), red fruit (initially reddish, two-winged samara), reddish stems and twigs, red buds, and, in the fall, excellent orange-red foliage color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, leafhoppers, borers, scale and caterpillars.  Verticillium wilt attacks the vascular system and can be fatal.  Canker, fungal leaf spot and root rots may also occur.  Wind and ice may break some branches. Leaf hoppers can cause substantial damage.
","
Garden Uses
Plant as a specimen tree for the lawn, street or park. It is of note that this tree has a shallow, flattened root system that may buckle nearby sidewalks or driveways if planted too close.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist soils, but shows somewhat surprising tolerance for poor dry soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharinum commonly known as silver maple gets its name from the silvery undersides of its leaves. This is one of the largest deciduous trees native to Missouri, typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a rounded open spreading crown. It is native to eastern and central North America where it typically occurs in moist to wet, sometimes mucky, often poorly drained soils on floodplains, along the edges of streams and rivers and in low woods. It is a fast-growing, somewhat graceful tree that formerly was a very popular urban landscape selection for lawns and streets, but has more recently fallen somewhat out of favor because of the proclivity of its weak-wooded limbs to split when stressed by high winds or ice/snow. Polygamous greenish yellow flowers bloom in clusters in early spring (March) before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired samaras (to 2” long) that mature in late spring. Bark is gray to brownish gray. Mature tree trunks and limbs develop a shaggy appearance as the bark develops long thin flaky scales that exfoliate at the ends. Deeply 5-lobed light green leaves (to 6” across) have silvery undersides. Fall color is usually unremarkable. Tree sap is sweet, hence the species name which comes from the Latin word for sugar, but syrups made therefrom are greatly inferior to those made from sugar maple (Acer saccharum).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose and canker. Also susceptible to scale and borers. As with many fast growing trees, silver maple has weak brittle branches that are susceptible to breaking in high winds or when coated with ice/snow in winter. Shallow roots may damage nearby sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful large landscape tree. Weak wood is a concern. Perhaps best sited in areas of poor soil or low wet conditions where other stronger wooded trees will not grow.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharum commonly known as sugar maple is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which will typically grow 40' to 80' tall (sometimes to 100') with a dense, rounded crown. This tree is a main component of the Eastern U.S. hardwood forest and is one of the trees which is most responsible for giving New England its reputation for spectacular fall color. Medium green leaves (3-6"" wide with 3-5 lobes) turn yellow-orange in autumn, sometimes with considerable color variations. Fruit is the familiar two-winged samara. Sugar maples are long-lived trees which grow relatively slowly (somewhat faster in the first 35 years). Native Americans taught the early colonists how to tap these trees to make maple syrup which has now become a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and Canada. Excellent shade tree.  The sugar maple leaf is the national symbol of Canada.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap. Saccharum is the genus name for sugarcane.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose, cankers, leaf spot and tar spot. Also susceptible to aphids, borers and scale. Leaf scorch may be a problem in drought conditions. Has been frequently used as a street tree, but is generally intolerant of road salt, soil compaction and pollution.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent specimen tree for the lawn or parks with beautiful fall color. May be used as a street tree as long as it can be located on a street and in a location where road salt, soil compaction and pollution will not be significant problems.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea aegyptiaca var. taygetea (synonymous with and formerly known as Achillea 'Taygetea') is a clump-forming yarrow that is noted for its deeply-dissected, fern-like, gray-green leaves and its tiny, long-lasting, bright yellow flowers. Flowers gradually fade to primrose yellow as they age. Flowers appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) from early to late summer on stems typically rising to 16-24” tall.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.This yarrow is one of the parents of the Galaxy hybrid yarrows and of Achillea 'Moonshine'.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can damage exposed plantings. If stems flop or become matted, they can be cut back.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea filipendulina, commonly known as fern-leaf yarrow, is an upright, clump-forming yarrow that is native to the Caucasus, Iran and Afghanistan.  Deeply-dissected, 1-2 pinnatifid, hairy, fern-like, aromatic (spicy) green leaves (each leaf to 10"" long and divided into as many as 15 pairs of linear-lanceolate toothed segments) form an attractive basal clump of foliage.  Tiny, long-lasting, bright golden flowers (yellow rays and yellow discs) appear in dense flattened plate-like compound corymbs (to 4"" across) throughout summer on stiff, erect stems rising above the foliage to 3-4' tall.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems.  Strong summer rain storms with high winds can flatten exposed plantings.  Staking of flower stems is often required, particularly if plants are grown in overly rich fertile soils.

Culture
Best grown in lean, dry to medium, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Plants also tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. If grown ornamentally, plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens. Cultivars also extend the range of flower colors to include pinks, reds, creams, yellows and bicolor pastels.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.The specific epithet millefolium means ""thousand-leaved"" in reference to the highly dissected foliage.Common yarrow has a large number of additional common names, including milfoil, thousandleaf, soldier’s woundwort, bloodwort, nose bleed, devil’s nettle, sanguinary, old-man’s-pepper and stenchgrass.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Plant stems are weak and lodge easily. If grown ornamentally, plants can develop into a tangled mass of stems and foliage by mid to late summer if not cut back. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can easily flatten exposed plantings. May spread somewhat aggressively.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, wild gardens, meadows, prairies and naturalized areas. Good fresh cut or dried flower.This species is generally considered to be too weedy for borders. Can be used as a flowering ground cover or lawn for sunny out-of-the-way areas (mow as needed with rotary mower on high setting).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea ptarmica, commonly called sneezewort or sneezeweed, is a rhizomatous perennial featuring loose corymbs of small white flowers which bloom throughout summer on plants clad with sessile, linear to lanceolate, finely toothed leaves that are aromatic when crushed.  Species plants are native to Europe and western Asia.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.Specific epithet is from Greek and refers to plants which caused sneezing.'Gipi Whit', commonly marketed under the trade  name of GYPSY WHITE, is a patented cultivar that features an abundant summer bloom of white double flowers on compact plants which grow in a mound to only 14"" tall but spread to as  much as 24"" wide.  This cultivar was selected in August 2003 from a controlled planting of Achillea ptarmica 'The Pearl' (The Pearl Group) in Gilroy, California.  U.S. Plant Patent PP18,120 was issued on October 9, 2007.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Does poorly in wet sites or in heavy, poorly-drained soils.  Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems.  Strong summer rain storms with high winds can damage exposed plantings.  If stems flop or become matted, they can be cut back.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Soils must not be allowed to dry out, but need sufficient drainage to prevent wet conditions from developing. Best in full sun in cool summer climates. Appreciates some afternoon shade in the St. Louis area. Needs cool nights below 70 degrees F. to grow well, and, like the related delphiniums, will often struggle in hot St. Louis summers. Cut back stems after flowering to encourage an additional late season bloom. Although plants may be propagated by division, they are often slow to establish and are probably best left undisturbed once planted.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aconitum carmichaelii is native to central China and is sometimes commonly called autumn-flowering monkshood because of its late summer to early fall bloom. It blooms later than most other species of Aconitum. It is an erect, tuberous-rooted perennial that features dense panicles (to 8” long) of hooded flowers atop rigid, leafy stems typically growing 2-3’ tall. In optimum growing conditions, plants may grow 4-5’ tall. Species flowers are deep purple inside and paler blue outside. The upper sepal of each flower develops into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower. Leathery, dark green leaves are deeply divided into 3-5 lobes. All parts of the plant (especially the roots and seeds) are extremely poisonous. Arendsii group hybrids (A. carmichaelii x A. carmichaelii var. wilsonii) feature uniformly deep azure blue flowers. Species is sometimes sold as A. fischeri.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoniton used for these poisonous herbs.Specific epithet honors medical doctor and plant collector Dr. J.R. Carmichael (d. 1877).The upper sepal of each flower develops into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Crown rot, powdery mildew and verticillium wilt are occasional problems. Generally does not need staking or other support. WEAR GLOVES WHEN WORKING WITH THIS PLANT. Avoid skin or oral contact with plant juices, and be particularly careful to cover up any open cuts or skin abrasions prior to entering garden areas.
","
Garden Uses
In the St. Louis area, this plant needs consistently moist soils and may be best grown in moist woodland areas, along streams or ponds, or on the periphery of bog or water gardens. Will grow in borders as long as the soil moisture requirements can be met. Because of the poisonous properties of the plant, it probably should not be grown in areas where small children might come in contact with it or in areas contiguous to vegetable gardens where tubers are growing.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aconitum napellus is an erect, tuberous-rooted perennial which features dense, terminal racemes (to 8"" long) of hooded, deep purplish-blue to violet flowers atop rigid, leafy stems typically growing 2-4' tall. Commonly found in moist pastures and moist mountainous areas of Europe and Asia. Dark green leaves are deeply divided into 5-7 toothed lobes. The sepals and petals of the flowers are similarly colored, with the upper sepal developing into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower. Also sometimes commonly called wolfsbane because this plant was once used as an arrow poison and in a poison bait for killing wolves. All parts of the plant (especially the roots and seeds) are extremely poisonous. The drug aconite is made from the leaves and roots of this species and was once prescribed as a cardiac and respiratory sedative.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoniton used for these poisonous herbs.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant having tuberous roots.The upper sepal of each flower develops into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in both boggy conditions (including shallow standing water to 9” deep) and consistently moist garden soils.  In water gardens, plant rhizomes slightly below the soil surface in moist soils at the water’s edge or in containers set in shallow water.  Rhizomes or existing clumps may also be planted in containers sunk into wet boggy areas to help prevent any possible invasive spread.  Scorched leaf tips will occur if soils are allowed to dry out.  Appreciates some relief from hot summer sun (e.g., afternoon shade or filtered sun) when grown in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area.  Slowly naturalizes by creeping rhizomes and can form large colonies in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acorus calamus commonly called sweet flag is a deciduous, spreading, marginal aquatic perennial that features iris-like, sword-shaped leaf blades (to 3/4” wide) typically growing in basal clumps to 30” tall.  It is a sterile triploid.  Although native to Europe, it was introduced into North America by settlers in the 1600s, and has naturalized over time throughout much of the U.S. (particularly in the northeast and central portions) including a number of counties in the State of Missouri.  Mature leaves have one slightly wavy edge and a prominent midrib.  Plants thrive in wet, boggy soils and are commonly grown today as foliage accents in water gardens and pond margins.  Although its foliage resembles that of a large iris, sweet flag is actually a member of the acorus family.  Insignificant tiny greenish flowers appear in elongated inflorescences (spadixes to 2-4"" long without showy spathes), which appear in late spring.  Flowers may give way to tiny fleshy berries.  Foliage and rhizomes are sweetly fragrant when bruised, hence the common name.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoron used for Acorus calamus and Iris pseuodacorus.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's reed-like appearance.Foliage and rhizomes are sweetly fragrant when bruised, hence the common name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Scorch will occur if soils are not kept consistently moist to wet.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or specimen for water gardens, stream or pond margins, bogs or in moist open woodland gardens.  May also be used in other areas of the landscape, such as low spots, as long as its high soil moisture requirements can be met.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Plants perform well in both boggy conditions (including shallow standing water to 3-4” deep) and consistently moist garden soils. Never allow soils to dry out. Scorched leaf tips and withering leaves are often the first signs of drying soils. In water gardens, plants are typically planted in containers with water covering the crowns or in wet soils at the water’s edge. Plants appreciate some relief from hot summer sun (e.g., afternoon shade or filtered sun) when grown in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Plants will slowly naturalize by spreading rhizomes, but are not considered to be invasive. If grown in containers sunk below the water surface, plants will not spread. Plants are not considered to be reliably winter hardy in the northern parts of USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acorus gramineus is commonly called grassy-leaved sweet flag. It is native to wetland areas of China, Japan, Korea, India, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines. It is a semi-evergreen, marginal aquatic perennial that features a grass-like tuft of narrow, linear leaf blades (1/4“ wide) that fan outward to 6-12” tall. Tiny, insignificant, yellow-green flowers bloom from spring to early summer on lateral, sedge-like flower spikes (spadixes to 2-4"" long). Flowers give way to very tiny, reddish, fleshy berries. Tufts will slowly spread over time by rhizomes to form a dense ground cover. Plants thrive in wet soils and are commonly grown in water gardens and boggy areas for foliage accent or ground cover purposes. Although it looks like a grass and its common name suggests a grassy appearance, grassy-leaved sweet flag is not a member of the grass family. Originally it was assigned to the arum family (which includes calla lily and jack-in-the-pulpit), but recently it has been transferred from arum to its own family called Acoraceae. Transfer from the arum family was in part done because plants in the genus Acorus do not have true spathes as are typically found in arum family members. Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoron used for Acorus calamus and Iris pseuodacorus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning grass.Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Scorch will occur if soils are not kept consistently moist to wet.
","
Garden Uses
Mass as a ground cover in small areas of water gardens, along streams or ponds, bogs or in moist open woodland gardens. Helps control erosion on water banks. Also effective in rock gardens, border fronts, foundations or as small landscape accents as long as the soil moisture requirements can be met. This plant may be used in the landscape in somewhat the same situations as one might use those species of Carex that prefer sun/part shade.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out, but need good drainage to prevent wet conditions from developing. Self-seeding may occur in optimum growing conditions where the berries fall to the ground. If naturalization is desired, berries may be picked and immediately planted into the ground as soon as they ripen in order to promote colonial spread.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actaea pachypoda, commonly known as white baneberry, is a Missouri native perennial that typically grows to 30” tall and is primarily cultivated in woodland and shade gardens for its attractive white berries and astilbe-like foliage. It naturally occurs in deep woods, north-facing wooded slopes, bluff bases and ravines in the eastern part of Missouri (Steyermark). Ternately-compound leaves with toothed leaflets usually remain attractive through most of the growing season. Tiny white flowers appear in spring in short, oblong terminal clusters atop long greenish stems rising above the foliage. Flowering stems thicken after bloom and turn an attractive red as pea-sized white berries develop in summer in elongated clusters. The berries are extremely poisonous if eaten, hence the common name of baneberry. Each berry has a distinctive small dark purplish spot (formed by the flower stigma) which gives rise to another common name of doll’s eyes. Berry toxicity probably is the main reason why wildlife seems to ignore the fruit, with the berry clusters typically persisting on the plants and providing ornamental interest until frost.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet means with a thick foot (stalk).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage decline may occur in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area, particularly if soils are allowed to dry out but also if soils become too wet from periods of heavy rain. Berries are extremely poisonous if ingested, and consideration should be given to avoid planting this species in areas frequented by young children.
","
Garden Uses
Woodland or shade gardens. Native plant gardens. Shady border areas.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers humusy, moisture-retentive soils. Foliage tends to scorch and otherwise depreciate if soils are allowed to dry out. Best sited in a location sheltered from strong winds. This is a slow-to-establish plant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actaea podocarpa is native to moist woods in the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Tennessee and Georgia. It is very similar in appearance to Actaea racemosa, except for very minor differences in the flowers and resulting fruits (A. racemosa flowers have one pistil and A. podocarpa flowers have three pistils). Features ferny, deeply-cut, deep green, 2-3 ternate leaves with 3-lobed, oval to oblong leaflets, on branched stems which form an attractive foliage clump to 3-4’ tall. Flower stems rise well above the foliage clump to a height of 5-6’ bearing terminal, bottlebrush-like, branched racemes (to 20” long) of apetalous, fluffy, creamy white flowers. Flowers have no fragrance. Blooms in late summer to early autumn. Synonymous with and formerly known as Cimicifuga americana. All plants in the genus Cimicifuga have recently been transferred to the genus Actaea.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet is in reference to the fruit being formed on a thick stalk.Many plants in the genus Actaea are commonly called bugbane in reference to the odoriferous insect repellent properties attributed to most plants in the genus.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. When in bloom, the tall flower spires will benefit from staking or other support, particularly if plants are not sited in sheltered locations. Flower spires tend to bend toward bright light, particularly when plants are grown in substantial shade. Leaf margins may brown up (scorch) and growth may slow down if soils are not kept consistently moist.
","
Garden Uses
Flower spires add architectural height to shaded borders, shade gardens, woodland gardens, cottage gardens or naturalized areas. Ferny foliage provides excellent texture and color to the landscape throughout the growing season. Best in groups, although single plants have good specimen value once established.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actaea racemosa, commonly called black cohosh, is an upright, Missouri native perennial which occurs in rocky woods in the Ozark region of the State. It typically grows to a total height (foliage plus flowering spikes) of 4-6’, but under optimum conditions can reach 8’. Small, numerous, creamy white, fragrant flowers appear in late summer to early fall in long, terminal racemes resembling fluffy spires (typically 1-2’ long) rising well above the foliage on wiry stems. Astilbe-like, deeply cut, tripinnate foliage is an attractive deep green. Synonymous with and formerly known as Cimicifuga racemosa. All plants in the genus Cimicifuga have recently been transferred to the genus Actaea.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being produced in racemes.The common name of bugbane is in reference to the odoriferous insect repellant properties of this plant. Cohosh comes from an Algonquin word meaning rough in reference to the appearance of plant rhizomes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rust and leaf spot are occasional problems. Foliage generally does not need staking, but taller flower spires may need some support. Flower spires tend to bend toward bright light, particularly when plants are grown in substantial shade.

","
Garden Uses
Adds architectural height and late summer bloom to a shaded part of the border or shade garden. Also effective in woodland gardens, cottage gardens and naturalized areas. Best in groups, although single plants have good specimen value once established. White flower spires are generally more demonstrative in front of darker backgrounds. Deep green foliage provides excellent texture and color to the landscape throughout the growing season.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Planting in infertile soil may temper somewhat rapid growth habit. Needs frequent pruning, including an annual winter pruning of each stem back to 8-10 buds and an annual summer pruning of excessively long shoots.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actinidia arguta, commonly known as hardy kiwi or tara vine, is a deciduous, fast-growing, twining woody vine that is typically grown for its attractive foliage and edible fruit.  It is native to woodlands, mountain forests, streamsides and moist locations in eastern Asia, China and Japan.  It grows to 25-30' or more, but growth is often so rampant that this vine, in its native habitat, may climb to as much as 100' into large trees.  Broad-ovate to elliptic deep green leaves (3-5"" long) emerge in spring, scented greenish-white flowers (to 3/4"" long) bloom in June and edible grape-sized smooth-skinned fruits (to 1 1/4"" long) mature in September-October.  Species plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants), with at least one male pollinator needed for fruit set on female vines. It tastes similar to, though slightly sweeter than, its larger-fruited relative, the true kiwi, Actinidia deliciosa, which can not be grown north of Zone 8.Genus name comes from the Greek word aktis meaning ray in reference to how the plant growth radiates like the spokes of a wheel.Specific epithet means sharply toothed or notched in reference to the toothed leaves.
","
Problems
No serious disease or insect problems.
","
Garden Uses
This fast growing vine can be grown both for its beautiful foliage and its fruit. Rapid growth habit makes it suitable for a variety of cover-type uses such as on a trellis, arbor, patio overhead, fence, or wall.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 11. North of USDA Zone 11, plants should be grown in containers and overwintered indoors. In containers, desert rose is best grown in a loose, sandy or gravelly, well-drained soil mix in full sun. Plants have excellent heat tolerance. Apply regular moisture during periods of growth, but allow soils to dry between waterings. Regular applications of fertilizer in spring will help promote flowering. Plants can be left outdoors in sunny locations during the summer. As soon as temperatures begin to dip below 55 degrees F. in autumn, bring containers indoors to sunny but cool locations with reduced watering. Plants usually lose their leaves in winter and go into a dormancy-like period. For container plants, the best caudex usually develops from seed-grown plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adenium obesum, commonly called desert rose, is a thick-stemmed sparsely-leaved perennial succulent that is native to semi- arid, sub-Saharan regions of eastern and southwestern Africa plus the Arabian peninsula. In the wild, this plant will eventually rise to 6-9' tall, but will grow much smaller in containers. It forms a broad, swollen, often grotesque caudex (usually partially buried underground) from which rise twisted leafless gray-green to brown branches. Leathery, spirally-arranged, fleshy, ovate, gray-green leaves (to 4"" long) appear at the stem tips. Narrow, bell-shaped, salverform flowers (to 2"" across), each with five spreading lobes and five protruding stamens, are red, pink or rose with white to pale yellow throats. In the wild, flowers bloom in summer with some irregular continued bloom throughout the year. As houseplants, flowers typically bloom only in summer. Milky plant sap is poisonous.Genus name is the Latinized Arabic name aden used for Adenium obesum.Specific epithet means fat or succulent.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Sharp soil drainage is required to prevent possible onset of rots. Additional potential disease problems include fungal leaf spot. Mealybugs, scale and aphids are potential insect pests.

Culture
Grow in consistently moist, neutral to alkaline soils in part shade to full shade. Plants in the wild will sprawl from wet limestone rocks. Native Missouri growing conditions are difficult to duplicate in home gardens. Notwithstanding the U.S. growing range of this plant, it may not be reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum capillus-veneris, commonly called southern maidenhair fern, is a deciduous, clumping fern with a drooping habit that grows to 12-18” tall and slowly spreads by short creeping rhizomes. It features bipinnate to tripinnate fronds with wiry, black stems that are distinctively arching to pendent. Small pinnae (each to 1/2” long) are fan-shaped, having wedge-shaped bases and irregular lobing at the apex. Sori (spores) appear in summer on the reflexed pinnae undermargins. In Missouri, this fern is typically found in moist ledges and crevices of dolomite bluffs and on boulders along streams and rivers in the Ozark Mountains and adjacent areas (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to northern maidenhair fern (Adiantum pedatum), except among other things its fronds are unforked. Soft delicate finely textured foliage is attractive in woodland areas. This fern is native throughout the world in tropical to temperate regions including South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. In the U. S., it is uncommonly found throughout the southern states north to California, South Dakota and Ohio.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning hair (capillus) of Venus (veneris) as reflected by the sometimes used common name of Venus maidenhair fern for this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaves may scorch in direct sun. Fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental fern for shaded areas of woodland or native plant gardens.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Best in bright but sun-dappled or filtered light in sheltered locations with good air circulation.  Part shade is better than full shade.  Container plants grown as houseplants should be placed near sunny windows but not in direct sun.  Foliage may scorch in full sun but growth will lose vigor in too much shade.  Water freely and evenly, but avoid overwatering.  Soils should never be allowed to dry out.  Mist foliage to increase humidity.  Best indoor daytime temperatures are around 70 degrees F., dipping to 60 degrees F. at night.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as rough maidenhair fern, is an evergreen to deciduous fern featuring bipinnate to tripinnate fronds (each to 14” long).  It typically grows in an arching foliage clump to 12-18” tall, spreading over time by wiry, short-creeping rhizomes to form small colonies.  Each frond is divided into narrow pinnae stemming from the center stem of the frond, with each pinna being clad with rough textured, oblong to fan-shaped, medium to dark green pinnules (leaf segments to 1/2” long).  Each pinnule has sori (spores) which appear in summer on the undermargins of the pinnules (6-14 sori per pinnule). This fern is native to shaded rainforest and open rocky sites, often found along rivers and banks, in Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands, tropical Asia and Africa.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the southern U. S. (Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Hawaii).  This fern tends to be deciduous when grown outdoors in temperate conditions of USDA Zones 8-10, but is semi-evergreen to evergreen when grown in semi-tropical to tropical conditions or indoors as a houseplant.  Juvenile foliage emerges showy pink in sharp contrast to the leathery dark green mature foliage, hence the sometimes used additional common name of rosy maidenhair fern.  Pink fronds gradually mature to dark green or bronze green.  Common name of rough maidenhair fern is in reference to its rough-textured foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin hispus meaning hair in reference to the fronds having minutely hairy stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaves may scorch in direct sun.  Rhizome rot may occur in wet soils.  At the other extreme, fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.  Watch for aphids, mealybugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
This is a popular ornamental fern which may be grown outdoors in USDA Zones 8-10 (perhaps Zone 7 if mulched and sheltered in winter) in shaded areas of woodland gardens and/or in containers/hanging baskets in shaded patio areas.  North of Zone 8, it is usually grown indoors as a houseplant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist, humusy, acidic soils in full shade. Spreads slowly by creeping, branching rhizomes to form large colonies over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum pedatum, commonly called northern maidenhair fern, is a deciduous, clump-forming, Missouri native fern which typically grows 1.5 to 2' tall and is most frequently found on rich wooded slopes, ravine bottoms and damp shady woods. Features finely-textured, somewhat frilly fronds which have curved stalks and are palmately-divided (i.e., fronds divide into finger-like projections). Wiry stems are reddish-brown to black. Crosiers (coiled young fiddleheads) emerge pink in spring.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet means cut like a bird's foot in reference to the fronds.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. High summer heat may cause fronds to brown by mid to late summer, particularly if good soil moisture is not maintained and/or plants are grown in too much sun.
","
Garden Uses
Attractive ornamental fern for the shaded border, woodland garden, shaded rock garden or native plant garden. Combine with broad leaves of hostas, caladiums or brunneras. Also effective as an edger along paths in shade gardens.

Culture
This is a perennial fern that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In the St. Louis area, it is typically grown as a houseplant, where it seems to respond best in bright indirect light including diffused sun, but dislikes direct sun. If grown in full shade, foliage will lose its vitality. Use a consistently moist but well-drained potting soil. Roots must never be allowed to dry out. This can be a difficult plant to grow in St. Louis because it needs a very humid atmosphere. Avoid placing plant in drafty areas or in locations near heat registers. Pots may be set in a tray of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Consider siting pots in bathrooms where atmospheric humidity is generally higher. May be grown as a houseplant year around, but sometimes benefits from a winter rest. Remove any browned foliage immediately.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum raddianum, commonly called Delta maidenhair fern, and its cultivars are perhaps the most commonly grown of the non-winter hardy maidenhair ferns. Triangular, 3- or 4-pinnate fronds with dark stalks emerge from a dense rootstock of short, branching rhizomes. Fan-shaped pinnae (leaflets) emerge light green but darken with age. Fronds typically grow to 12” wide and 18” long. Cultivars of this species come in different colors, shapes and forms. Synonymous with and formerly known as Adiantum cuneatum.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet honors Italian botanist Giuseppe Raddi (1770-1829).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale and mealybugs. Leaves may scorch in direct sun. Fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Houseplant that may be considered for bathroom areas and bright areas with some diffused sun. Hanging baskets, pots or containers.

Culture
Best grown in bright but filtered sun to part shade in consistently moist but well-drained soils.  Best with a small pool of water in the central cup formed by the rosette of leaves.  Replace leaf cup water periodically.  Rinse entire plant with water as needed to remove dust build up on leaves.   Best performance occurs with indoor temperatures ranging from low 60s F. at night to 75-80 F. during the day.  Reduce watering in winter.  Remove dead rosettes as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aechmea fasciata, commonly called urn plant or silver vase plant, is an epiphytic bromeliad that is native to southeastern Brazil.  In its native habitat, it will grow in the ground or in trees without taking any nourishment from the tree.  This is a stemless plant that typically grows 1-3' tall in a basal rosette of stiff, arching, broad, strap-shaped, elliptic-oval, silvery-green leaves  which resemble an urn.  Leaf margins have black spines.  An urn plant shoot blooms only once and then dies.  But the bloom is spectacular.  Inflorescence is a dense pyramidal head consisting of small violet flowers  (mature to red) which are surrounded by showy pink bracts.  Bracts remain showy for several months.  Offsets (pups) form at the base of this shoot (mother plant).  Offsets can be transplanted as new plants after the original plant dies (wait until they reach 6"" tall to transplant).   Many cultivars, some featuring variegated leaves, have been developed.Genus name comes from the Greek word aichme meaning a point in reference to the stiff points on the sepals.Specific epithet means bound together.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems.  Watch for scale and mealybugs.    Leaf spot and crown rot may occur, especially during propagation.  Leaf tips will brown up if soils dry out or plants are grown in areas too cold.  Root rot may occur if soils are kept too moist.  If plant will not bloom, place a ripe apple at the base of the plant and cover the plant with a clear plastic bag for about 1-2 weeks (keep plant from sun to avoid overheating). For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in sun or shade. Perhaps best in part shade in the St. Louis area. Foliage will often scorch in hot, dry, full sun conditions. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Flower heads may be removed to prevent self-seeding and to maintain appearance of the ground cover. Any unvariegated shoots which appear should also be removed as they tend to be more vigorous and can quickly take over a planting. If foliage declines in summer, plantings may be sheared by mowing on a high setting to remove the unsightly leaves and to stimulate new foliage growth. Spreads by underground stems (rhizomes) and can be quite aggressive. If not grown in self-contained areas, mechanical barriers may need to be installed to prevent unwanted spread of plants. This plant is considered invasive in certain areas of the United States. Check local laws before adding to your landscape. Commonly sold by nurseries in flats for covering large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called bishop's weed or goutweed is one of the most popular ground covers for quickly covering large areas. Will rapidly form a continuous mound of attractive foliage typically growing to 8"" tall with an indefinite spread. Unfortunately, once it gets going, it acts like the proverbial snowball going downhill and can be difficult to contain. Individual leaflets (to 3"" long) are oval and serrated. Tiny white flowers appear in flat-topped, dill-like inflorescences (umbels) which are typical of the parsley/carrot family. Flowers appear above the foliage in May-June, but are not particularly attractive and are often sheared off by gardeners where practicable.Genus name comes from the Greek words aix meaning ""goat"" and podion meaning ""a little foot"", in reference to the leaf shape.The specific epithet podagraria means ""snare of gout"", in reference to its traditional use as a treatment for gout.Common name is in reference to a former use of the plant in the treatment of gout. Also commonly called Bishop's weed in reference to the purported resemblance of the leaflet shape to that of a bishop's miter.'Variegatum' has basal foliage that is light green with creamy white margins. It is less aggressive than the species but plants may revert back to the species with all green leaves and greater vigor. To retain the variegated form, remove any plants that revert.
","
Problems
Leaf blight is a somewhat common disease which is particularly troublesome in hot and humid summer climates. Foliage often declines by mid-summer to the point where mowing on a high setting is needed to revitalize a planting. This plant is an aggressive spreader and is considered invasive in certain areas of the United States. Check local laws before adding to your landscape.
","
Garden Uses
Avoid use of this plant in any mixed planting with other perennials such as in a rock garden or border. Best in a pure, contained planting (surrounded by natural or installed barriers) where it can be allowed to grow and spread solely as a ground cover. Can be quite effective when grown in the shade of trees or large shrubs.

Aeonium undulatum, commonly known as saucer plant, is a succulent evergreen subshrub in the orpine family that typically grows to 2-3’ tall.   It is native to the Canary Islands.   This plant features large rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped, glossy green leaves (each leaf to 4-8” long).  Leaves are often wavy-edged and sometimes have hair-fringed margins.  Small, star-shaped, dark yellow flowers bloom in large terminal pyramidal panicles atop stems rising above the foliage rosettes to 1-2’ tall.  Most plants do not flower every year (some take up to 5 years to flower).  After flowering occurs, the underlying foliage rosette dies, but this is only a significant problem with plants which have only one rosette.Genus name is the Latin name for a plant of this genus of succulents.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word unda meaning wave in reference to the wavy plant leaves.

Culture
Best grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Avoid dry soils.  Responds to high heat or drought stress by dropping leaves.  Leaves will remain on the tree longer, perhaps to early fall, if soils are given even and consistent moisture in summer.  This shrub/tree has an early leaf drop and is deciduous for a good part of the year. Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-8. May tolerate Zone 6b(-5°F) if given adequate protection. It prefers a Mediterranean-type climate with wet winters and dry summers and is infrequently grown in the eastern U.S.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus californica, commonly called California buckeye, is a large, deciduous shrub or small tree that is native to the foothills and valleys of the coastal ranges, Tehachapi, and Sierra Nevada Mountains of California in the western United States at elevations below 4,200’ where it is typically found on dry slopes, canyons and along waterways.  It frequently grows in the wild as a spreading shrub to 15’ tall, but will sometimes grow as a small tree to 30’ tall.  It is particularly noted for its (a) open flat-topped crown, short trunk, and spreading branchlets that are reddish to gray-brown when young, (b) smooth silver-gray bark, (c) opposite, lustrous, palmate, shiny dark green leaves, with each leaf having 4-7 but usually 5 narrow-elliptic leaflets (each to 6” long) with fine marginal teeth,  (d) flower panicles (inflorescences to 4-12” long) which contain numerous, fragrant, creamy white to pink 4 to 5-petaled flowers with spidery anthers borne in May-June, (e) pear-shaped to fig-shaped, spineless, rough-textured, thick-husked fruit capsules (to 3” long) which split open in fall at maturity to reveal 1-2  dark brown nuts (each to 1” diameter) commonly known as buckeyes, and (f) sticky winter buds.  

In California, this shrub/tree typically begins new growth in February but usually enters dormancy during the dry summer months.   In the foothills of the Sierra, leaves dry up and are shed in late spring to early summer, typically turning brown and hanging from the tree throughout much of the summer.  In the coastal ranges, leaves typically remain green much later in summer before dropping to the ground as long as soil moisture remains at acceptable levels.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet is in reference California being the native habitat.
","
Problems
For plants in the genus Aesculus, potential disease problems include powdery mildew, rust and anthracnose and potential insect problems include bagworms, Japanese beetle and borers.  Leaf scorch (edges brown up) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to strong wind.  

California buckeye has no serious pest or disease problems.  Early leaf drop typically occurs in areas with dry soils.  All parts of California buckeye are poisonous to humans if ingested.
","
Garden Uses
Single to multi-trunked small tree or large shrub.  Very limited distribution in the United States in large part because of extremely early leaf drop.  Landscape specimen.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus flava, commonly called yellow buckeye, is a medium to large deciduous tree that grows 50-75’ (less frequently to 90’) tall with an oblong-rounded crown. It is the largest of the buckeyes that are native to the U. S. It is typically found in rich soils on river bottoms, stream banks and mountain slopes from southeastern Pennsylvania to northern Alabama and Georgia and down the Ohio River valley to Illinois. Palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with five spreading, toothed, ovate-oblong leaflets to 4-7” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color often includes attractive shades of yellow-orange. Yellow flowers (each 1/2 to 1” long) in erect panicles (to 6” long) appear in mid-spring. Flowers are followed by the familiar buckeye fruit, which is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 buckeyes encased by a leathery light brown partitioned husk. The husk is smooth on the outside, unlike the spiny Ohio buckeye husk. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each buckeye turns red brown with a light eye (hilum). Since colonial times, buckeyes have been carried by many school children and adults as good luck charms even though they are poisonous. Mature trunks (to 2-3’ in diameter) have gray-brown bark that is fissured and scaly. This tree is also noted for having non-sticky buds and non-ridged bud scales. Other common names include big buckeye and sweet buckeye. Synonymous with Aesculus octandra.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means yellow in reference to flower color.
","
Problems
Leaf blotch can be a significant problem. Powdery mildew, leaf spots and anthracnose may also occur. Buckeye lacebug, Japanese beetles, bagworms and borers are infrequent but potentially troublesome. Leaf scorch (brown edges) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to wind. Disease problems for this tree are generally not as severe as those for Ohio buckeye.
","
Garden Uses
Not recommended as a street tree or for use near homes because of the litter produced (particularly twigs, fruit and falling leaves). May be used as an ornamental shade tree. A good selection for more remote areas of the landscape including native plant and moist woodland areas. Michael Dirr considers this tree to be the most beautiful of the large growing Aesculus.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus glabra, commonly called Ohio buckeye, is native from western Pennsylvania to Iowa south to Alabama and Arkansas. It is found throughout the State of Missouri where it typically occurs in rich or rocky wooded areas of valleys, ravines, bluff bases, slopes and thickets (Steyermark). This is a low-branched, small to medium sized deciduous tree that typically grows 20-40’ (less frequently to 75’) tall with a broad oval-rounded crown. Bright green palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with five spreading ovate-oblong leaflets to 3-6” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color is usually yellow, although foliage may develop interesting and attractive shades of orange and red in some years. Greenish-yellow flowers (to 1” long) appear in clusters in mid-spring (late April-May in St. Louis). Flowers are followed by the familiar fruit, which is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 buckeyes encased by a leathery light brown partitioned husk covered with warty spines. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each buckeye turns a handsome shiny dark mahogany brown with a light tan eye. Since colonial times, buckeyes have been carried by many school children and adults as good luck charms. Ohio is known as the Buckeye State and has adopted the buckeye as its State Tree. All parts of this tree, particularly the flowers, bark and twigs, emit an unpleasant odor when bruised, hence the sometimes common name of fetid buckeye.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means smooth without hairs in probably reference to the smooth leaves.Native Americans reportedly called the fruit of this tree “hetuck” meaning eye-of-the-buck in reference to the supposed resemblance of the shiny dark mahogany brown fruit to the eye of a buck deer. The common name of buckeye evolved therefrom.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus hippocastanum, commonly called horsechestnut, is native to the Balkans. It is a medium to large deciduous tree that typically grows 50-75’ tall with an upright oval-rounded crown. Light green palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with 7 (less frequently 5) spreading ovate-oblong leaflets to 4-10” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color usually consists of undistinguished shades of yellow and brown. Showy white flowers with red or yellow markings appear in upright terminal panicles in mid-spring (May in St. Louis). Fruit is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 horsechestnut(s) encased by a leathery light brown husk covered with sharp spines. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each horsechestnut turns a handsome shiny dark mahogany brown with a round light tan scar. Chestnuts and horsechestnuts are in totally different families. Chestnuts (Castanea) are in the beech family (Fagaceae) and produce edible nuts. Horsechestnuts and buckeyes (Aesculus) are in the soapberry family (Sapindaceae) and produce poisonous nuts. Horsechestnut is closely related to Ohio buckeye, being most easily distinguished from the latter by having spiny sharp fruits and sticky buds.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet is the Latin name for horsechestnuts.

","
Garden Uses
A beautiful landscape tree for parks and large lawns. Depreciation of the foliage during the growing season due to disease, insect and scorching problems somewhat limits its value. It has been widely planted in the midwest as a street and shade tree.

Though native to rich woodland areas in Alabama, Georgia and northern Florida, it is winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus parviflora. commonly called bottlebrush buckeye, is noted for being one of the best summer-flowering shrubs for shade areas. It is a dense, mounded, suckering, deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub which typically grows 6-12' tall. Features palmate green leaves (5-7 leaflets) and erect, showy, cylindrical panicles (to 12"" long) of tubular white flowers with conspicuous red anthers and pinkish filaments. Mid-summer bloom can be spectacular. Flowers give way to glossy inedible, pear-shaped nuts (buckeyes) encased in husks, however these nuts are infrequently produced in cultivation in the northern parts of this shrub's growing range (including St. Louis). Foliage turns yellow in autumn. A very large planting of bottlebrush buckeye can be observed on both sides of the sidewalk leading south from the Climatron at the Missouri Botanical Garden.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means small flowers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus pavia, commonly called red buckeye, is a deciduous clump-forming shrub or small tree with an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows 10-20’ tall. Showy, erect, 4-10” long panicles of red to orange-red, narrow-tubular flowers appear in spring. Palmately compound, shiny, dark green leaves are attractive in spring and early summer, but usually begin to decline by August. Smooth, light brown, globular (1-2” diameter) seed capsules encase 1-3 shiny seeds called buckeyes that ripen in the fall. Seeds are poisonous and are avoided by most wildlife. Fall foliage color is unremarkable. Red buckeye is native to southeastern Missouri where it typically occurs in low rich wooded valleys, at bluff bases, on wooded slopes and along streams (Steyermark). Flowers are attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds and bloom in St. Louis at about the same time that the hummingbirds return to the area in spring migration.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet honors 17th century Dutch botanist Peter Paaw (Petrus Pavius).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus sylvatica, commonly called painted buckeye or dwarf buckeye, is a fast-growing,  thicket forming, understory deciduous shrub (6-15’) or small tree (to 30’) that is native to the southeastern U.S. where it is typically found in moist, rich woods or along streams from southern Virginia to Georgia west to Tennessee and Alabama.  It is particularly prevalent in Piedmont plateau bottom lands and along the coastal plain. It may be found in the Blue Ridge Mountains in elevations to 3300’.  Palmate-compound leaves are among the first to emerge in spring and among the first to drop in late summer to early fall.  Each leaf has 5 short-stemmed, oblong-obovate leaflets (each leaflet to 4-6” long).  Leaflets are distinguished by having yellow to orange midveins.  Leaves sometimes emerge burgundy-red in early spring before turning to yellow-green above and green beneath.  Bisexual and male flowers (to 1 1/4” long) appear in the same flower cluster (each cluster to 8” long) with the bisexual flowers located near the base.   Flower color is variable.  Flowers are often yellow, cream-colored or pink, but sometimes wholly red or yellow veined with red.  Flowers bloom in showy upright clusters (to 4-6” long) in April-May.  Fruit is a leathery, globular, 3-parted capsule (to 1.5” thick) containing 1 to 3 large, shiny, dark brown seeds commonly known as buckeyes.  Seed ripens in late summer at which point the capsules split open to release them.  Brown scaly bark.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word parts sylv meaning woods or forests and atic meaning habitat.Common name of painted buckeye is in reference to the purported resemblance of the upright flower clusters to a paint brush.
","
Problems
For plants in the genus Aesculus, potential disease problems include powdery mildew, rust and anthracnose and potential insect problems include bagworms, Japanese beetles and borers.  Leaf scorch (edges brown up) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to strong wind.  

Foliage decline usually occurs throughout summer resulting in loss of leaves in early September.

Culture
Although this evergreen agapanthus may be planted in the ground in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10, it is best grown in tubs or containers in the St. Louis area (Zones 5b-6a) where it is not winter hardy. This is a tender perennial that grows from a fleshy-rooted rhizome. For container plants, plant rhizome 1/2"" below soil surface, keep soils consistently moist and provide moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer). Plants bloom best when roots are pot-bound. Site containers in locations with afternoon shade. In fall prior to the first frost, remove containers to a bright, frost-free location for overwintering. Provide very limited water in winter (just enough to keep leaves from drying/wilting). Return containers outdoors in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agapanthus africanus, commonly called lily-of-the-Nile, is native to South Africa (not the Nile River as the misleading common name suggests). It is an evergreen species that produces rounded clusters (umbels) of blue, funnel-shaped flowers atop stiff, upright, leafless, fleshy stalks (scapes) typically rising 18-24"" tall above a dense mound of basal narrow, strap-shaped, linear, grass-like leaves. Blooms in summer. Foliage mounds are attractive when plants are not in bloom. White cultivars also available.Genus name comes from the Greek words agape meaning love and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means of Africa.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache foeniculum, commonly known as anise hyssop, is an upright, clump-forming perennial of the mint family that is native to parts of the upper Midwest and Great Plains (Wisconsin to Ontario west to British Columbia and south to Colorado). It is typically found in prairies, dry upland forested areas, plains and fields. It grows to 2-4' tall. It is noted for its mid- to late summer bloom of lavender to purple flowers in terminal spikes and its anise-scented foliage. Square stems are clad with ovate to broad-lanceolate dull green leaves (to 4"" long) with toothed margins. Flowers appear in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) which are densely packed into showy, cylindrical, terminal flower spikes (3-6"" long). Gaps sometimes appear along the flower spike. Individual, tiny, tubular, two-lipped flowers (each to 1/3"" long) have no fragrance. Flowers are attractive to bees (good nectar plant), hummingbirds and butterflies. Aromatic leaves can be used to make herbal teas or jellies. Seeds can be added to cookies or muffins. Dried leaves can be added to potpourris.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.Specific epithet comes from a Latin meaning hay.

Plants tolerate heat and dry soils once established.  Deadhead spent flowers to promote additional bloom.  Sandy/gravelly mulches will protect plants and help to avoid onset of rot.  Plants may also be grown in containers (pinch back foliage tips in spring to limit mature plant height).  Take cuttings from containers in late summer for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache rupestris, commonly known as giant hyssop or threadleaf giant hyssop, is an upright, clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 2-3' tall.  It is native to cool mountain slopes (5000' to 7000' elevation) in Arizona and New Mexico. Small, tubular, 2-lipped, salmon/burnt orange flowers with purplish calyxes bloom in summer (July-August) on erect salvia-like flower spikes (to 12"" long) located atop strong, square stems clad with narrow, aromatic (anise scented), linear to linear-lanceolate, thread-like gray-green leaves (to 2"" long).  Sometimes a sporadic rebloom will occur in fall if plants are cut back in late summer after the initial flowering period.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.Specific epithet means living on a cliff.This plant is sometimes commonly called sunset hyssop in reference to the resemblance of the flower colors to the hues of a sunset.  It is also sometimes commonly called rock anise hyssop or licorice hyssop in reference to the minty-licorice-root beer aroma of the foliage of this mint family member.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave americana is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to Mexico.  It has been introduced and has naturalized in a number of tropical areas around the world.  Each plant typically forms a large, evergreen basal rosette of thick, succulent, lanceolate, gray-green leaves.  Each rosette typically matures over time to as much as 6' tall by 8-10' wide.  Each leaf has a waxy bloom, spiny tip, and sharp marginal spines.  This plant is also well-known for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Plants are monocarpic (bloom only once and then die).  Common name of century plant suggests the plant will live 100 years before flowering.  In reality, outdoor plants typically bloom between the 10th and 25th years.   Indoor plants rarely flower.  When an outdoor plant blooms, it sends up a single, stout, erect flowering stalk from the center of the basal rosette of leaves to 15-30' tall or more.  The flowering stalk resembles a narrow telephone pole with horizontal branching near the top.  Greenish-yellow flowers (each to 3-4"" long) bloom in panicles at the branch ends.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of each rosette over time, often forming a colony of new plants.  Once a plant flowers and dies, the offsets around the base of the plant continue to grow.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet means of America.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this agave serves as an interesting tropical accent or specimen.   It is a large and showy plant for the landscape.  It needs a large space in which to grow.  Plants are often grown in cactus or succulent garden areas.  It will grow well in containers as an indoor plant at a much smaller size.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it grows best in a sandy/gritty, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates poor soils. Also tolerates dry soils and drought, but appreciates regular watering. Plant leaves will shrivel in dry conditions, but will revive when given moisture. Intolerant of frosts particularly when temperatures dip below 28 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave attenuata, commonly called century plant, is a rosette forming perennial succulent that is native to the plateaus/mountains of central Mexico. It is perhaps most noted for its attractive leaves and its huge drooping flower stems. Spineless, fleshy, ovate, light gray to pale yellowish-green evergreen leaves (to 28” long) form a large symmetrical rosette. Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes. With age, a stem/trunk to 3’ long may develop, with the trunk becoming visible as the older leaves of the rosette fall off. Each rosette will flower only once, usually when the plant reaches about 10 years old. The “flower” is a huge recurving raceme to 5-10’ tall with small, drooping, densely-packed, yellow-green to white flowers. Flowers are followed by seed pods. The rosette dies after flowering, but suckers/offsets at the base remain as new plants. Additional common names for this plant include lion’s tail, swan’s neck and foxtail. Plants may be grown outdoors in parts of California, southern Texas and southern Florida.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet refer to the gradual reduction of the leaf as it tapers to a slender point.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave parryi, often called Parry's agave or mescal, is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to grasslands, chaparral, desert scrub, pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands in Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico typically at elevations from 4,000 to 8,000 feet.  It is most noted for its attractive blue-gray to gray-green evergreen leaves, but is also noted for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Thick, rigid, smooth, ovate to oblong, blue-gray leaves (to 12” long) form a large, dense, symmetrical, basal rosette.  A rosette will typically mature over time to 2' tall by 3' wide.  Each leaf has spiny margins with a one inch terminal spine.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes.  Each rosette will flower only once, usually at some point between 10-15 years (not the 100 years suggested by the also-used common name of century plant used for some agaves), but sometimes flowering will not occur until 20-30 years.  One huge flowering stalk (to 20' tall) will rise from each rosette, with each stalk producing 20 to 30 side branches and with each side branch containing a large cluster of creamy yellow flowers.  In its native habitat, flowers typically bloom in summer (June - August).  Flowers are followed by seed pods.  The flowering rosette dies after flowering, but new rosettes formed by suckers/offsets from the base of the mother plant will remain.  Native Americans used this agave as a source of food, fiber, soap and medicine. Plant liquids may be fermented to form an alcoholic beverage called pulque which may be further distilled to form mescal or tequila.  

Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable in probable reference to the flower spikes.  

Specific epithet honors Charles C. Parry (1823-1890), physician-botanist-plant collector.

Problems
Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave univittata, known as McKelvey's century plant or thorn-crested agave, is a perennial, rosette-forming succulent native to extreme southern Texas and northern Mexico. It is found at relatively low elevations (less than 300 ft.) in areas around the Gulf Coast and Rio Grande. Rosettes typically reach 1-2' tall and 1.5-3' wide. Dark green, slightly convex leaves (to 15"" long) sport a sharp, terminal spine and sharp, curved, marginal spines.  Once an individual plant reaches maturity, it will send up an unbranching flowering stalk up to 15' tall. The flowers are around 1.5"" in length, with pale green to pale yellow coloration. This agave suckers readily, and can form large colonies over time.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet univittata means ""one stripe"", and refers to the single, light green stripe which can run lengthwise down the center of the leaves on some individuals.The common name McKelvey's agave refers to Susan Delano McKelvey (1883-1964). A botanist at the Arnold Arboretum, she specialized in lilacs and the flora of the southwestern United States.'Splendida' forms smaller rosettes compared to the species plant, growing to a maximum of around 12"" tall and 18"" wide at maturity. The succulent leaves are dark green with a greenish-yellow stripe down the center. The leaves reach 7"" long and 2"" wide, and are armed with sharp marginal and terminal spines. Mature rosettes will send up a 12' tall flower stalk bearing greenish-yellow flowers that attract hummingbirds.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs and snails may damage foliage. Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.

Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers part shade in moist, humusy soils. Does reasonably well in dryish soils however. These plants have decidedly better shade tolerance than most other species of Eupatorium. Deadhead spent flower heads to avoid any unwanted self-seeding. Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ageratina altissima commonly called white snakeroot, is native to woodland areas in the Eastern United States. It is common throughout Missouri where it typically occurs in rich or rocky woods, thickets, wood margins and rocky areas (Steyermark). It features small fluffy bright white flowers (composites with rays absent) arranged in loose, flattened clusters (corymbs to 3-4” across) atop smooth stems typically rising 3-5’ tall. Blooms from late summer to frost. This is a somewhat weedy perennial that can spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding. Long-stalked, sharp-toothed, taper-pointed, lance-shaped to elliptic-oval, nettle-like, dark green leaves (3-6” long) are paired along the stems. Native Americans reportedly used a decoction of the roots as a remedy for snakebite, hence the common name. Settlers who drank milk from cows that fed on this plant often developed the disease called milk sickness. This plant is synonymous with Eupatorium rugosum.Specific epithet means tall or highest.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf miners and flea beetles may attack the foliage. Self-seeding and rhizomatous can spread rapidly in optimum growing conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, wild gardens, woodland gardens and naturalized areas. May be effective in shady corners of the border.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers rich soils with good drainage and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Plants tend to wilt quickly if soils are allowed to dry out. Tolerates light shade, and prefers some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. In climates where powdery mildew is a problem, avoid overhead watering and site in areas with good air circulation. Ageratums are easily grown from seed. Seed may be started indoors in late winter and transplanted outdoors after threat of frost has passed. Seed may also be sown directly in the garden after last frost date, however flowering season will be shorter (late summer to frost). Seeds are tiny and difficult to work with, particularly for direct outdoor plantings. For gardeners who do not wish to use seed, live plants are available from many nurseries in cell packs/six packs and flats. Space taller varieties 12” apart and shorter varieties 6” apart. Spent flowers will fall to the ground as they fade to be replaced by new bloom throughout the growing season. Prompt deadheading of the faded flowers is not necessary, but keeps a planting tidy and tends to promote a better uninterrupted bloom. Plants may not bloom to frost in some hot summer climates, but usually do so in cooler ones. First autumn frost will kill most if not all plants, at which point they may be removed from the garden.

Ageratum houstonianum, commonly called floss flower, is a frost-tender annual of the aster family that provides continuous bloom for beds, gardens or containers from late spring to frost. Features fluffy flowers (basically asters with ray flowers absent) in flattened to slightly rounded clusters atop compact, mounded plants generally ranging from 4” to 18” tall. Some taller varieties (e.g., the triploid ‘Blue Horizon’) are more erect and grow to as much as 30” tall. Species flowers are medium blue, however many cultivars are available in commerce in various shades of blue, pink, red, white and bicolor. Leaves are typically rounded, cordate-at-the-base, hairy, slightly quilted and soft green. Taller varieties make good cut flowers.Genus name presumably comes from the Greek a meaning not and geras meaning old age  because the flowers hold their color for a long time.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids and whiteflies. Powdery mildew is an occasional problem, particularly in hot and humid climates where soils are kept on the dry side and air circulation is poor. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Taller plants usually benefit from some support.
","
Garden Uses
Shorter varieties are excellent as bedding plants, edgers (along paths, walkways and border fronts) and container plants (hanging baskets, window boxes, urns or other containers). Also effective in rock gardens. Taller varieties are appropriate for mid-borders or cutting gardens.

Culture
Grow as an indoor plant in the St. Louis area. Prefers diffused sun or good indirect light. Avoid placing in direct sun. Well-drained, peaty potting mixture. Consistent moisture from spring to fall. Does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a winter period of rest. Reduce watering from early fall to late winter. Do not allow soils to dry out. This indoor plant tolerates atmospheric dryness and somewhat shady locations. Normal room temperature with recommended 60 degrees F. minimum winter temperature.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aglaonema commutatum, commonly called Chinese evergreen, is an evergreen perennial that generally resembles dieffenbachia (dumb cane) in appearance. It typically grows to 20” tall. Thick, elliptic to lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 4-8” long and 2-3” wide) with attractive silver-gray blotches on erect, sometimes branched stems. As a houseplant, it rarely flowers. Each axillary flower (typical arum family) features a small creamy white spadix enclosed by a pale green spathe, usually in late summer to early fall. Clusters of red berries follow the flowers.Genus name comes from the Greek words aglaos meaning bright or clear and nema meaning a thread in reference to the stamens.Specific epithet means changing in form.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids, mealybugs, spider mites or scale. Rots may occur if plants are over-watered. Leaves may brown up if plants are grown in very dry air or placed in a drafty location. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor ones. Tolerates close to full shade. Quite tolerant of urban pollution. This is a suckering plant that can form large colonies or thickets that tend to choke out native plants. Spreads invasively by aggressive root suckering and self-seeding. Most homeowners are more interested in eradicating this plant than in growing it ornamentally.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ailanthus altissima, commonly called tree of heaven, is native to China and was introduced into New York City in 1820 as a street tree and food source for silkworm caterpillars. It has now naturalized throughout much of the United States. In many areas it has become a noxious weed. It is extremely fast-growing and it will grow almost anywhere. It can literally grow up from a crack in the sidewalk, and is strong enough to push up through the blacktop surface of a parking lot. It not only grows in cities, but may also be found in the country along roads, fencerows, clearings and wood margins. It can grow up to 60-80’ tall with a loose, open, sometimes graceful form, but is usually seen growing much shorter in urban areas. Wood is weak and tall trees in exposed areas may easily top out in strong winds. Odd-pinnate compound leaves (most often 11-25 leaflets each) tend to give it a certain tropical appearance. Leaflets have large gland-tipped teeth at the base. These teeth distinguish it from the sumacs, which also have long compound leaves. Mostly dioecious (separate male and female trees), but some perfect flowers exist. Male flowers have an unpleasant odor. Actually all parts of the tree have an unpleasant odor. Blooms early summer (June-July). Flowers are greenish. Female flowers produce seeds (twisted samaras) in clusters ripening to reddish-brown in September. Smooth pale gray bark. This is the tree featured in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith (1942), a coming of age novel about a young girl growing up in a Brooklyn tenement who finds the toughness and persistence of Ailanthus, growing up from the sidewalk cracks, to be an aspirational metaphor for overcoming the adversities of her own life.Genus name is the Latinized version of the native Moluccan name ailanto meaning sky tree for a species of this genus.Specific epithet is a superlative form of the Latin word meaning high, hence the common name of tree of heaven.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Invasive and difficult to eradicate. Weak wooded. Short-lived. Messy.
","
Garden Uses
This is not a good landscape tree, however if it is to be grown, female trees are generally preferable to male trees. It will grow and prosper in areas of poor soils where few other trees will flourish.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils with good drainage, but tolerates moderately dry ones. Will grow in full shade, but best foliage color usually occurs in part-sun locations (at least 3-4 hours of sun per day). Provide good air circulation in hot and humid areas where crown rot is a problem. Divide plants if they become overcrowded. This low-growing bugleweed will spread in the garden by stolons (reptans means creeping) to form an attractive, mat-like ground cover. Plants may be cut back to the ground after flowering, if necessary, to rejuvenate the foliage. Large plantings may be mowed on a high mower setting to remove spent flower spikes and to tidy the appearance of the planting. Space plants 6-9” apart for prompt cover. On variegated forms promptly remove any non-variegated leaves that may appear.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ajuga reptans, commonly called bugleweed, is a dense, rapidly spreading, mat-forming ground cover which features shiny, dark green leaves. Whorls of tiny, blue-violet flowers appear in mid to late spring on spikes rising above the foliage to 10"". Cultivars of this species feature leaves with more interesting and varied foliage color. When in full flower, large clumps of bugleweed can produce a striking display. Dense foliage will choke out weeds. Not particularly tolerant of foot traffic.Genus name origin is unclear.Specific epithet means creeping.
","
Problems
Crown rot can be a problem, particularly in the humid conditions of the deep South and in heavy soils. Avoid planting in wet, heavy soils, provide good air circulation and divide when clumps become overcrowded. Also avoid planting near perennial beds or lawns where its spreading nature could pose removal problems.
","
Garden Uses
Primary use is as a ground cover. Will fill in large, shady areas where lawns are difficult to establish. May also be planted on banks or slopes, under trees or around shrubs. Can be planted over spring bulbs such as snowdrops (Galanthus). Avoid planting adjacent to lawn areas since little islands of ajuga may start appearing in the grass. Good for small spaces, containers and rock gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in most soils. Best in well-drained sandy loams with regular moisture in full sun to part shade. Prefers full sun, but tolerates close to full shade. Also tolerates some drought. Needs a support structure upon which to grow unless grown as a ground cover. For best fruit production, plant more than one vine to facilitate good cross-pollination. Many experts recommend hand-pollination. Prune as needed in late spring after flowers appear. May be cut to the ground to renovate. Foliage is semi-evergreen in warm winter climates. Grows rapidly and can suffocate shrubs or other vegetation if not kept in check.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Akebia quinata, commonly called fiveleaf akebia, is a deciduous, twining, woody vine that rapidly grows to 20-40’. It produces compound palmate leaves, each with 5 elliptic to oblong-obovate leaflets (1-3” long) which are dark green above and glaucous below. Small chocolate-purple flowers bloom in drooping axillary racemes in spring. Flowers are monoecious, with both staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers appearing in the same raceme. Flowers are often hidden by the foliage, but are quite interesting on close inspection and have a pleasant fragrance. Flowers give way to sausage-shaped, violet fruit pods (to 4” long) which split open in fall to reveal small black seeds imbedded in a whitish pulp. The whitish pulp is edible. Native to China, Korea and Japan, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized in parts of the eastern U.S. Sometimes commonly called chocolate vine.Genus name is the Latinized version of the Japanese name akebi for these twining shrubs.Specific epithet means having five parts, in reference to the five-leaflet palmate leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rampant growth can be a problem.
","
Garden Uses
Provides quick cover in sun or shade for trellises, fences, arbors, pergolas and walls. May also be sprawled over the ground as a ground cover to camouflage rock piles or old tree stumps or to provide soil stabilization for banks. An excellent ground cover for shady areas and woodland gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Best flowering occurs in full sun.  Prefers rich, light soils.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, however, including poor ones.  Tolerates alkaline conditions.  Tolerates drought, but best growth occurs with regular watering.  Thrives in high summer heat.  Not reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Albizia julibrissin, commonly called mimosa or silk tree, is a fast-growing, small to medium sized, deciduous tree that typically grows in a vase shape to 20-40’ tall with a spreading, often umbrella-like crown.  It is native to Asia (Iran to Japan).  It has been widely planted in the U. S. as an ornamental and has escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the southeastern U. S. and California.  In the wild, it is typically seen growing in vacant lots, waste areas, clearings, wood margins, fields and along roads.  It can be quite invasive in watersheds where water currents carry and distribute the seeds downstream.  It is noted for its bipinnate compound dark green leaves (to 20” long).  Each leaf has 10-25 pinnae, with each pinnae having 40-60 tiny leaflets (to 1/4” long).  Leaves have a fern-like appearance.  Fluffy, pink, powder puff flowerheads cover the tree with a long summer bloom.  Flowers are fragrant and attractive to bees.  Flowers give way to flat bean-like seed pods (to 7” long) which persist into winter.  Sensitive leaflets close up when touched and at night.  Leaflets fall to the ground after frost, producing no fall color.Genus name honors Filippo degli Albizzia, 18th century Italian naturalist, who introduced the genus to Italy in 1749.Specific epithet comes from the Persian word gul-ebruschin meaning floss silk in reference to the flowers.
","
Problems
Wilt is becoming a serious problem in many areas. Also susceptible to mimosa web worm.  Self-seeding can produce numerous seedlings.  Falling leaves, flowers and seed pods can pose significant clean-up problems if trees are planted near homes.  Weak wooded limbs are susceptible to damage from strong winds and ice/snow.
","
Garden Uses
Generally considered to be an attractive but inferior landscape tree.  May be used as a lawn accent in areas where soils are poor or alkaline.  Avoid planting in areas where wilt is a problem.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and some light shade, but will not tolerate wet winter soils. Considered a biennial or short-lived perennial. If grown from seed, plant seeds in August or September for bloom the following year. Although short-lived, hollyhocks easily self-seed and can establish colonies in the garden that persist for years as if they were perennials.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alcea rosea, commonly called hollyhocks, are old garden favorites. The flowers grow on rigid, towering spikes or spires which typically reach a height of 5-8' tall and usually do not require staking. Foliage features large, heart-shaped (3, 5 or 7 lobes), rough lower leaves which become progressively smaller toward the top of the spire. Long bloom period of June to August. Sometimes listed in nursery catalogs under Althaea.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek word alkaia for a kind of mallow.Specific epithet means pink.
","
Problems
Foliage is susceptible to rust, leaf spot and anthracnose. Spider mites and Japanese beetle can also be problems. Foliage can become rather tattered and unkempt in appearance when attacked by the aforementioned insects and/or diseases, but the flowers generally are not affected. May need staking, particularly if not protected from wind.
","
Garden Uses
Hollyhocks provide excellent architectural height, contrast and a certain amount of old world charm to cottage gardens and border backgrounds. Also effective when grown against walls or fences.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade, but tolerates close to full shade.  Prefers part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Performs well in moist garden areas. Freely self-seeds in the garden to the point of being somewhat invasive in optimum growing conditions.  Prompt removal of spent flower stems will not only prevent self-seeding but may also encourage a sparse, late summer rebloom.  Plants may be grown from seed started indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  Divide plants as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alchemilla mollis, commonly known as lady’s mantle, is a clumping perennial which typically forms a basal foliage mound (6-12” tall ) of long-stalked, circular, scallop-edged, toothed, pleated, soft-hairy, light green leaves (to 6” across) each with 9-11 shallow rounded lobes.  It is primarily native to mountain areas in eastern Europe (Carpathians, Caucusus and Turkey).  Tiny, apetalous, star-shaped, chartreuse flowers appear in loose, spreading clusters (compound cymes) atop stems rising above the foliage to 12-18” in late spring to early summer.  The tendency of plant leaves to retain moisture beads after a rain is considered to be a unique and attractive ornamental feature.Origin uncertain, perhaps the Latinized version of an Arabic name.Specific epithet means soft.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be an aggressive self-seeder. In hot summer climates such as St. Louis, leaves may scorch in full sun exposures or if soils are permitted to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Border fronts.  Cottage gardens.  Edging for paths.  Mass as ground cover.  Flowers may be cut at the peak of bloom and hung up to dry in a dark room for future use in dried flower arrangements.

Thrives in deep fertile soils, but tolerates poor ones.  Survives winter temperatures that dip to about 
28 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aleurites moluccanus, commonly known as Kukui or candlenut tree, is a tropical broadleaf evergreen tree in the spurge family that is noted for producing attractive flowers, walnut-sized fruits and maple-like, pale green, evergreen leaves.  It typically grows to 20-50’ tall, but less frequently to as much as 90’ tall.  It is native from Indonesia and Malaysia into the western parts of Polynesia (exact native range is unclear), but very early spread and naturalized throughout Southeast Asia and the islands in the South Pacific.  Polynesian settlers reportedly brought this tree to Hawaii where it has naturalized in open forests, lower alpine slopes, river margins, hillsides and ridges.  Although not native to Hawaii, Kukui was designated the Hawaiian State tree in 1959.  The flower has been designated as the island flower of Molokai.  Historically, Hawaiians once strung candlenuts on a palm leaf tendril and burned them one at a time for light.  They also extracted oil from the nuts for use as a fuel in stone oil lamps called Kukui hele po.  Kukui means light, hence its use as a common name.  

Spreading to downward-arching branches and twigs of this tree are clad with glossy, heart-shaped, triangular to oblong, pale green leaves (to 4-8” long) with toothed margins.  Leaves often have 3-5 shallow lobes.  Young leaves, young branches and inflorescences are stellate hairy.  From a distance, this tree appears to have a white flour-like dusting.  

Small-but-showy, 5-petaled, creamy white flowers bloom in dense panicled cymes (to 4-9” long) at the branch ends.  Flowers are monoecious.  Flowers typically bloom April to October, but may bloom irregularly throughout the year with flowers and fruits often being present on the tree at the same time in various stages of development.  Female flowers are followed by thick-rinded, walnut-sized fruits (to 2” diameter), each containing 1-2 large, nut-like seeds (candlenuts) which have a high oil content.  Nuts are pressed for oil which is not only used in candles/lamps, but is also used in making additional products such as soaps and varnishes.Genus name comes from the Greek word aleuron meaning floury in reference to the white flour-like dusting present on juvenile leaves.Specific epithet means from the Moluccas (aka Spice Islands) located in eastern Indonesia which is part of the native habitat for this tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to dieback and canker.  All parts of this tree are toxic to humans if ingested, and in particular the seeds.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this evergreen tree has excellent ornamental features.  Good landscape specimen or shade tree.

Plant corms in containers for use in water gardens. Freely self-seeds in optimum growing conditions, sometimes to the point of being very aggressive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alisma triviale, commonly called water plantain, is a rhizomatous, Missouri native, marginal aquatic perennial that typically occurs along the muddy margins of or emersed in shallow water near the edges of ponds, streams, sloughs, marshes and ditches. Plants growing in water typically exhibit lax, often narrow, foliage whereas plants growing on muddy margins exhibit erect foliage. Whorls of tiny white flowers (1/4” diameter) appear in summer in large, branched panicles atop flowering stems growing well above the foliage to 2-3’ tall. Flowering stems rise from the centers of basal rosettes of long-stalked, broad ovate to lance-shaped, gray-green leaves (blades typically to 6-8” long). 

Synonymous with Alsima plantago-aquatica var. americanum.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name for this plant.Specific epithet means common or ordinary.Common name is in reference to the similarity of the leaves to those of the unrelated true plantains (genus Plantago).

Tropical evergreen vine or shrub that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Best flowering in full sun. Best performance occurs in hot and humid climates where nighttime temperatures do not dip below 60 degrees F. In St. Louis, this plant is grown as an annual or in containers or greenhouses. Container plants must be brought inside before first frost and overwintered as houseplants in large sunny rooms with intense bright light and moderate humidity or in a greenhouse. When grown as a vine, it must be trained to grow on a support structure because it does not twine or have tendrils/aerial roots. May also be pruned to grow as a shrub. Thin stems to promote air circulation if fungal diseases attack the foliage. Can be difficult to grow as a houseplant due to large size.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Native to Brazil, golden trumpet or common allamanda is a frost-tender, evergreen, tropical plant that is primarily grown as a climbing vine, but may also be pruned as a shrub. As a vine, it will grow rapidly to 20’.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Allamanda schottii, commonly called bush allamanda is an evergreen tropical shrub native to Brazil. It typically grows to 4-5’ tall. Features clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers with orange-red throat stripes and leathery, elliptic to obovate, dull green leaves (2-4” long) that appear in whorls of 3-5 along the stems. If spent flowers are not deadheaded, rounded, prickly, burlike fruits will form providing some additional ornamental interest, albeit at the expense of a more profuse bloom. Freely blooms throughout the summer to first frost. This species is synonymous with and sometimes listed for sale as A. nerifolia or A. cathartica var. schottii. It is generally more shrub-like than A. cathartica. As with most dogbane family members, the stems exude a toxic milky sap.Genus name is in honor of Swiss botanist Frederik Allamand (b. about 1735, d. after 1776).Specific epithet may honor Richard van der Schot (c.1730-1819).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium ampeloprasum, commonly known as wild leek, is in a large genus of about 400 species of variable plants in the onion family. This species is native to Southern Europe, northern Africa, western Asia and Egypt, but has been introduced and in many cases naturalized in a large number of additional areas throughout the world.  This species consists of biennial, onion-like plants now divided into three different horticultural/vegetable groups, namely (1) Porrum Group (leeks grown for their tasty stems), (2) Ampeloprasum Group (elephant garlic and levant garlic grown for their mild garlic-like bulbs) and (3) Kurrat Group (kurrat).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word ampelos meaning vine and parson meaning leek for a leek found growing in vineyards.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Slugs attack young plants.  Rust may be the most serious disease affecting leeks (remove and destroy infected plants). Watch for mildew and leaf spot.  Onion maggots and thrips may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Vegetable commonly added to casseroles, salads, stir fry, soups and stew, but may be eaten raw.

Culture
Plant as sets (bulblets) in early spring as soon as ground can be worked, about 6"" apart in rows 8"" apart with ½ to 1"" covering of soil. Give room to grow as each bulblet will become a whole clump. They prefer well-drained, sandy and limey soil. Any organic material should be well composted. Provide regular shallow cultivation to reduce weed competition. Harvest tops or entire plant at anytime. Pull as green onions when 8"" tall. Top harvesting will delay bulb crop maturity. Harvest bulbs when tops die back: pull soil away from clump to expose to full sun, pull up in several days, let dry outside for several days before moving to screens or racks in dark dry environment.

Allium cepa, commonly called shallots, are considered essential in French cooking, with a flavor somewhere between onions and garlic. Use greens as you would use green onions or chives. Use bulbs for soups, salad dressing, vegetable dishes, and casseroles. The onion is a cultivated vegetable of great antiquity and is not known as a wild plant. Greeks and Romans believed shallots originated in Palestine.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet is Latin for onion.
","
Problems
Onion yellows is a viral disease that attacks all members of the onion family, especially non-seed types vegetatively propagated by bulblets. The virus stunts the plants, deforms foliage, and over winters in bulbs and bulblets. Using infected bulbs and bulblets spreads the virus through insect vectors to other onions in the vicinity. Select planting stock from reputable sources to insure they are virus free. Do not plant bulbs or bulblets that may have a problem.
","
Garden Uses
Fresh like green onions or in cooking.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun to light shade. Best in full sun, but appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Best in sandy loams. Plants will naturalize by self-seeding and bulb offsets in optimum growing conditions. Deadhead flowers before seed sets to help control any unwanted spread. Foliage persists past flowering into late summer before dying back. Plants are easily grown from seed which should be planted in spring or from bulbs/bulb offsets which should be planted in autumn.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium cernuum, commonly called nodding wild onion, is a Missouri native plant which occurs primarily in rocky soils on glades, bluff edges, open woods and slopes in the Ozark region of the State. Plants typically grow 12-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12” tall) and tiny bell-shaped, pink to lilac pink (occasionally white) flowers which appear in loose, nodding clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Wild nodding onion is distinguished from most other native alliums by the fact that its scapes crook sharply downward at the top just below the flower so that the flower umbel nods (hence the common name). Blooms in summer. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, nodding onion is not generally considered to be of culinary value today.

Specific epithet means nodding.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means nodding.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 6-9 where this plant is easily grown in rich, deep, medium moisture, well-drained, sandy-limey loams in full sun to part shade.  Plants tolerate a variety of soil types.  Best performance occurs with consistent moisture during the growing season.  Perennial plants are easy to propagate by division.  This perennial bunching onion can be harvested year round in mild winter climates.  It infrequently self-seeds, but clumps will spread slowly in the garden.  In cold winter climates north of Zone 6, this plant is typically grown as an annual.  When grown as an annual, sow seeds in early spring for summer use.  Plant 1/4” and 1/2” apart and 1/2” deep.  Provide regular shallow cultivation to reduce weed competition.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium fistulosum, commonly called spring onion, Welsh onion, or Japanese bunching onion, is a clumping, slowly-spreading, evergreen perennial onion that is primarily grown as a vegetable for harvest of its tasty onion-flavored leaves.  Elongated underground bulbs are barely thicker than the plant stem (some characterize this species as being “bulbless”).  Hollow, leafless, blue-green flowering stalks rise to 24-36” tall, each stalk being topped by a globular terminal umbel (to 3” diameter) containing tiny, yellowish-white, 6-tepaled flowers.  Each umbel typically sports 50-100 flowers which bloom from late May to August.  Hollow, basal green leaves are linear with entire margins, parallel venations and glabrous surfaces.  

This bunching onion was developed in Asia from a wild relative native to China.  It was brought to Europe in the 17th century.  The original Chinese plant may be extinct in the wild.  This onion has been extensively cultivated since ancient times.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in Alaska and in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word fistulosus meaning hollow in reference to the stems and leaves.Common name of Welsh onion does not refer to the country of Wales, but is derived from the German word walsch meaning foreign.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Slugs attack young plants.  Mildew, rust and leaf spots may appear.  Watch for onion maggots and thrips.
","
Garden Uses
Widely used as a food additive in salads, garnishes, soups, stews, stir fry and Chinese cooking.  Also serves as a chive/leek substitute.  May be grown in herb gardens and vegetable gardens where the young leaves and bulbils may be harvested for food.  Leaves are tasty when young, but are not ornamentally attractive.  Flowering stalks are ornamentally attractive when flowers are in bloom.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  In the St. Louis area, bulblets (cloves) are best planted in fall but need the protection of a good winter mulch (e.g., straw).  In very cold winters, the bulblets may not survive.  Bulblets may also be planted in early spring.  Fall plantings generally produce larger bulbs for harvest.  Plant bulblets 2” deep and 6"" apart with the pointed end up in rows 1-2' apart.   Harvest in late summer after most of the leaves have turned yellow-brown and begin to fall over.  Dry bulbs for several days before storing in a cool, dry location.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium sativum, commonly called garlic, is a bulbous perennial of the onion family.  It is native to the Mediterranean area.  Foliage consists of aromatic, linear, flattened, grass-like green leaves.  In some varieties, a central scape topped by an umbel of pinkish-white flowers rises from each clump of leaves to 18” tall in summer.  Garlic is typically grown as an annual in herb and vegetable gardens for its segmented bulbs which are commonly used in cooking.  

Garlic comes in two varieties:  hardneck (designated as Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon) and softneck (designated as Allium sativum var. sativum).  Hardneck varieties typically produce a flower stalk, with flowers giving way to a seed cap.  Each bulb typically contains 4-10 cloves (bulb is smaller but cloves are larger than those of softneck).   Hardneck varieties come in three different types:  Rocambole, Poreclain and Purple Stripe.  By contrast, softneck garlic plants typically do not produce a flower stalk.  They produce bulbs with smaller but more numerous cloves than hardneck garlic plants.  Each bulb typically contains 12-20 cloves.  Softneck plants are also braidable (bulbs can be braided together into attractive chains by weaving the soft grass-like tops together).  Softneck garlic varieties are the ones most often commonly sold in supermarkets because they typically have a much longer shelf life than hardnecks.   Softneck varieties come in two different types:  Silverskin and Artichoke.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means cultivated.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Root/bulb rot may occur in wet, poorly-drained soils.   Potential insect pests include nematodes, thrips, bulb mites, onion maggots and wireworms.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium schoenoprasum, commonly called chives, is a small bulbous perennial which iscommonly used as a culinary herb to impart mild onion flavor to many foods, including salads, soups, vegetables and sauces. Plants also have good ornamental value. Features thin, tubular, grass-like, dark green leaves which typically grow in dense clumps to 12"". Attractive, globular, clover-like clusters of pale purple flowers subtended by papery bracts appear in spring and summer on scapes (stems) often rising above the foliage to 18"" tall. Flower heads can be used as a garnish for soups and salads.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words schoinos meaning rush and prason meaning leek in reference to the rush-like leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot may occur in wet, poorly-drained soils.

Culture
Easily grown in rich, sandy to gritty, dry to medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Plants form dense, slowly-spreading clumps over time. Plants perform best with consistent moisture during the growing season, but tolerate drought after flowering ends. Plant new bulbs 3-5"" (3 times bulb width) deep and 4-6"" apart in fall. Plants may be grown from seed which is usually sown in fall. Plants will self-seed (sometimes prolifically) in the garden, and if left unchecked will naturalize freely. Deadhead flowers before seed sets to help control any unwanted spread. Bulbs of established plants may be dug, divided and replanted in late summer to early fall after foliage has died down.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium sphaerocephalon, commonly called round-headed leak or drumstick allium, is a bulbous perennial that is ornamentally grown for its early summer bloom of rose-purple to pink flower heads. This plant is native throughout Europe to the Caucusus, Iran and northern Africa. Cylindrical, hollow, grassy, gray-green leaves to 14"" long form a foliage clump in spring. In late spring, sturdy slender flowering stems rise to 24-36"" tall topped with egg-shaped flower heads (umbels to 1"" wide) in an impressive early summer bloom (June-July in St. Louis). Each flower head is a tight, dense, clover-like cluster of tiny florets that emerge deep green but mature (top to bottom) to rose-purple. Each flower head displays an interesting bi-color effect as the florets change from green to purple. This species blooms later than most of the alliums. Flower heads resemble the flower heads of some clovers. Flowers lack fragrance. Bulbils sometimes form after flowering. Leaves and bulbs have an onion-like aroma when cut or bruised. Synonymous with and formerly known as Allium sphaerocephalum.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means with a round head.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils. Mildew, rust, leaf spots and thrips may appear. Plants may colonize over time, but are not considered to be invasive.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental onion for rock gardens, beds and borders, cottage gardens, open woodland areas and meadows. Best grown in large groups or massed. May be naturalized. Grows well in containers. Cut flowers are excellent for both fresh cut and dried flower arrangements.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium stellatum, commonly called prairie onion, is a Missouri native plant that occurs primarily in rocky soils on limestone glades and bluff ledges in the Ozark region of the State (Steyermark). It is also found on rocky prairies in parts of the Midwest and Great Plains where it is also sometimes commonly called prairie onion. It is a bulbous perennial which typically grows 12-18"" tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12"" tall) and tiny, starry, bell-shaped, reddish-pink flowers which appear in rounded clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Blooms in mid to late summer. Leaves often die back by the time of flowering. Leaves and flower scapes rise directly from the bulbs. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, this species of allium is not generally considered to be of culinary value today. Bulbs were also used by early Americans as cough/cold remedies and as insect repellants. Nodding wild onion (Allium cernuum) is similar to this plant in size, culture and general appearance, except, as the common name suggests, the flower umbel nods rather than stands erect.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means star-like in reference to the flower shape.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage dies back in late summer.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium tuberosum, commonly called garlic chives, is a clump-forming onion family member which may be grown for both culinary and ornamental purposes. Features chive-like, gray-green leaves up to 12"" long which may be used in cooking in the same manner as chives (Allium schoenoprasum). Tiny, star-shaped, white flowers with brown striped tepals appear in loose clusters (umbels to 2"" wide) atop leafless 9-18"" stems in late summer into fall. Plants will colonize, and a small planting can expand rather quickly. All parts of the plant have an oniony smell when cut or crushed, however the flower scent is more suggestive of violets. Also commonly called Chinese chives because the plant is grown extensively in China for culinary purposes.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means tuberous.
","
Problems
No serious pest or disease problems. Can become a weed.
","
Garden Uses
Herb gardens, vegetable gardens, cottage gardens or naturalized areas. Attractive flowers have good ornamental value and are pleasant additions to rock gardens or border fronts, however flowers must be deadheaded before setting seed or seedlings will sprout up throughout the garden.

Culture
Easily grown in rich, moist but well-drained loams in full sun to part shade.  This is a woodland plant that is more tolerant of part shade conditions than most members of the genus.  Add sand to clay soils as needed to improve drainage.  This species spreads invasively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and over time can carpet large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium ursinum, commonly called wild garlic or ramsons, is a bulbous perennial that is native to damp shaded woods in Europe and northern Asia.  It produces small rounded bulbs on branched rhizomes.  Each year, leaves appear in late winter, flowers bloom in spring, and seeds mature by mid-summer at which point the plants die back and go dormant until the following late winter.  Each plant bears 2-3 distinctive, elliptic, linear, deep green basal leaves somewhat reminiscent of the leaves of lily-of-the-valley. If bruised or crushed, the foliage emits a strong onion/garlic-like aroma.  Flattened, 2-inch diameter, loose umbels of star-shaped white flowers bloom in spring atop leafless stems rising to 6-12"" (less frequently to 18"") tall.  Each umbel bears 15-20 flowers.  Leaves and flowers may be eaten raw (salads) or cooked (addition to soups, sauces or stews).  Leaf flavor begins to decline as the flowers begin to bloom.  Underground bulbs can also be eaten raw or cooked.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from Latin ursus meaning bear in reference to the proclivity of bears to dig up and eat these bulbs in the wild.An additional common name for this plant is bear's garlic.  Common name of ramsons is from Middle English ramsyn.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Mildew, rust and leaf spots may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Wild garlic is an attractive spring-flowering perennial which may be grown for both ornamental and culinary uses.  This plant should only be located in garden areas where its invasive spread will not interfere with other plantings.  Flowering drifts can be a sight of great beauty on the forest floor, but are not so beautiful when  they begin to form in a perennial border.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus cordata, commonly called Italian alder, is a pyramidal, fast-growing, small to medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Corsica and southern Italy. It typically grows to 30-50’ in cultivation. It is particularly noted for its attractive glossy green leaves. Flowers are monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same tree) appearing in catkins. Male catkins are yellow-green (elongated to 2-3” long). Female catkins are reddish-green but very small (1/4"" long). Catkins appear in March before the leaves emerge. Female catkins are followed by 1-inch long fruiting cones (strobiles) composed of winged seeds. These fruiting cones (largest in the Alnus genus) resemble small pine cones and are attractive to birds. They mature to reddish-brown in fall and persist into winter. Mature bark is a light gray-brown with fissures and ridging. Ovate, finely toothed, glossy green leaves (to 2-4"" long) remain on the tree late into fall (December), with insignificant fall color produced. Trees can fix nitrogen from the air.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet means heart-shaped in reference to the leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Canker can be severe. Watch for aphids, leaf miners, tent caterpillars, lace bugs and flea beetles. Powdery mildew may appear. Chlorosis will occur in high pH soils.
","
Garden Uses
Good selection for difficult sites such as moist low spots or dry sites with poor soils. Effective as a windbreak.

Best grown in medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates a wide range of soils, however, including dry, infertile ones. Best performace is in cool climates. Does not grow well south of USDA Zone 7. Suckers from the roots to form thickets. Prune from early to mid winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus glutinosa, commonly called black alder (also common alder or European alder), is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that is distinguished by its gummy young twigs and leaves and its obovate to rounded, glossy dark green leaves (to 4” long) with doubly toothed margins and blunt to sometimes notched apices. As a single trunk tree, it typically grows to 40-60’ tall in cultivation (to 100’ or more in its native habitat) with a narrow pyramidal form. As a multi-trunked tree, it grows much smaller and spreads. It has naturalized in many parts of eastern North America, particularly along streams and in low or swampy sites. Flowers are monoecious. Drooping male catkins (to 4” long) form in fall and overwinter on the tree. Small, plump, rounded female catkins form in late winter to early spring. The catkins flower in March before the foliage emerges. After flowering, the female catkins develop into 3/4-inch long woody cones (strobiles), with winged seeds forming therein. The seeds disperse in fall at maturity, but the woody cones typically remain on the tree over winter and persist into the following growing season. Alders are easily identified in winter by the presence of the drooping male catkins and the woody cones, both of which are ornamentally attractive. Winter branches are often added to floral arrangements. Dark brown bark with warty striping gives rise to the black alder common name. No appreciable fall color. Nitrogen fixing microorganisms develop in nodules on the tree roots in somewhat the same manner as with the legumes.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet means sticky or glutinous for its gummy twigs and leaves.
","
Problems
Canker is the most severe disease problem. Watch for aphids, leaf miner, tent caterpillars lace bugs and flea beetles.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus maritima, commonly called seaside alder, is a deciduous, multi-trunked, upright-rounded, fall-blooming large shrub or small tree that typically grows to 20-30' tall.  It is usually found in wet soils at low elevations along ponds, streams and rivers, including some dense pure stands in swamp-like areas with standing water.  It is an uncommon to rare species that is native to the U. S. where it occurs in three small disjunct populations, with each population now being classified as a separate subspecies:  (1) Alnus maritima subsp. maritima (coastal plain of Delaware and Maryland - Delmarva Peninsula); (2) Alnus maritima subsp. georgiensis (Bartow county in NW Georgia); and (3) Alnus maritima subsp. oklahomensis (Johnson and Pontotoc Counties in south central Oklahoma near the upper Blue River).  Notwithstanding the remote locations of these three subspecies, fossil records seem to suggest that this Alnus maritima once enjoyed a much larger geographic distribution many years ago.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning growing by the sea.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus serrulata, commonly called tag alder, smooth alder or hazel alder, is a multi-stemmed, suckering, thicket-forming, large deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-20’ tall.  It is most often seen in a multi-trunked form with a densely branched crown. It is native to boggy ground along streams/lakes/rivers, wetland margins, springs, spring-fed meadows, ditches and swampy fields from Nova Scotia to Illinois and Missouri south to eastern Texas and northern Florida.  

Trunks feature smooth gray bark with inconspicuous lenticels (pores).  Flowers are monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same tree), appearing in separate catkins in March-early April before the leaves emerge.  Male catkins (brownish-yellow flowers) are slender, cylindrical and droop in clusters of 2-5 from near the branch tips to 2-4"" long.  Female catkins (bright red flowers) are upright cylinders (to 1/4"" long) located at the twig tips in clusters of 2-5.  Female flowers are pollinated by wind.  Female catkins develop into 1-inch long fruiting cones (strobiles) to 3/4” long containing winged nutlets (seeds).  Fruiting cones mature to dark brown in fall, with persistence into winter.  Cones have woody scales and resemble small pine cones.  Birds feed on the seed.   Broad elliptic to obovate dull green leaves (2-4"" long) with serrulate margins are wedge-shaped at the base and pointed at the tip.  Insignificant fall color.  Root nodules fix nitrogen.  

Alnus serrulata is very similar in appearance to Alnus incana subsp. rugosa.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet is in reference to serrulate leaf margins.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where plants are best grown in part shade or filtered sun in moist to wet, organically rich soils in sheltered locations protected from strong winds which can seriously damage the huge ornamental leaves.  Leaves often scorch when exposed to full sun.  Plants will grow in periodically flooded areas.  Petioles weaken and are unable to support the leaves in too much shade. 

Where not winter hardy, rhizomes may be started indoors in early spring in pots or containers.  After last spring frost date, containers/pots may be sunk to the rim in the garden or set out on a patio.  Plants require regular watering and fertilization.  Before first fall frost, pots and containers should be brought inside where they can be overwintered in sunny, humid but cool (around 60-65 degrees F) locations.  Reduce watering in winter.  Return plants to the garden in spring.  Propagate by reddish seeds which develop on the spadix in a manner reminiscent of corn on the cob.  

Plants grow rapidly and may be grown as annuals in USDA Zones 4-8.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alocasia macrorrhizos, commonly called giant taro or upright elephant ears, is a rhizomatous tropical perennial of the arum family that is treasured both for its giant ornamentally decorative leaves which resemble the ears of an elephant and its edible rhizomes which have been cultivated for many years in the tropics as an edible vegetable  under the common name of taro.  This is a forest understory plant that has widely naturalized over large tropical areas extending from India to Southeast Asia to Malayasia, however it is unclear as to the specific geographic regions where this plant was originally native.  It is closely related to Colocasia, except for the position of the leaves (upright Alocasia leaves point skyward on rigid stems whereas drooping Colocasia leaves point toward the ground).  

Thick, cordate, prominently-veined, wavy-edged green leaves (to 3-6’ long and 3-4’ wide) are borne on rigid stalks (long-sheathed petioles) which emerge from a stout upright trunk (becoming woody with age) which can eventually grow to as much as 6’ tall.  The entire plant can eventually grow to as much as 12-15’ tall in optimum growing conditions with a spread to 6-10’ wide.  

Greenish spathe and spadix (Jack-in-the pulpit type) stand 8-10” tall (flowers are packed into the spadix and surrounded by the spathe).  Flowers are not particularly showy.  .  Flowers bloom intermittently throughout the year.  Flowers are followed by red berry-like fruits which are infrequently formed in cultivation.   

Notwithstanding its ornamental features, this giant taro is also an edible root vegetable.  It has been harvested for many years in the tropics as a potato-like substitute in areas where potatoes will not grow.  Stem pith is also edible.  Rhizomes and stems must first be cooked (usually boiled) prior to eating in order to remove calcium oxalates which render uncooked rhizomes and stems inedible.  Stem pith is typically boiled, and then dried and ground into flour.Genus name comes from the Greek words a meaning without and Colocasia the name of a closely allied genus, from which it was separated.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and rrhiza meaning root in reference to plant rhizomes.Alocasia is similar to but not identical to Colocasia.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aloe vera, commonly called medicinal aloe, is a stoloniferous, stemless, tropical perennial that grows upright with stiff rosettes of succulent leaves. Common name is in reference to the folk medicine history of this plant which goes back to the pre-Christian era. Lance-shaped green leaves (to 18” long) are spotted white and armed with whitish marginal teeth. Leaves mature to gray-green. Plants may grow to as much as 3’ tall. Flowering occurs only on mature plants, typically in summer. On container plants, flowering will only occur on plants grown in optimum conditions (e.g., sunny windows or sunny outdoor locations). Yellow flowers in racemes bloom atop erect stalks rising to as much as 3’ tall. Medicinal aloe is noted for the healing and cosmetic properties attributed to its sap. The sap is added to a large number of commercial cosmetics, particularly lotions and creams. Sap is noted for its ability to moisten dry skin. Sap from a broken leaf may be applied directly to burns on the skin for relief. Sap should not be eaten, but has been used in the past for treating peptic ulcers. The sap also reportedly has strong laxative properties. Medicinal aloe is also commonly called burn plant or burn aloe. Synonymous with and formerly known as Aloe barbadensis.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia galanga, commonly known as Siamese ginger, Thai ginger or galangal, is a tropical evergreen perennial with a thick aromatic rhizome.  It is native to Southeast Asia.  For culinary use, the rhizome is typically cut up into small pieces, thin-sliced, pounded into a paste, or dried and powdered for inclusion as a flavoring in a variety of food dishes such as soups and curries.  It is reportedly one of the most frequently used spices in Thai cooking, and is also quite popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.  Indonesian rendang is usually flavored with this rhizome.  Each plant typically grows to 6' tall in a clump of stalks clad with long green leaves (12-15"" long by 2-3"" wide).  Showy yellowish-white flowers with red centers bloom throughout the year on upright inflorescences.  Flowers are followed by red fruits (1/2"" diameter) which emerge green and then turn yellow before finally maturing to red.  Leaves, stalks, rhizomes and seeds all have a mild aromatic aroma.  Foliage is attractive and plants may be grown ornamentally without harvesting the rhizome.  Plants are evergreen when grown in frost-free locations.  In Southern Asia, fresh rhizomes are commonly sold in markets.  Rhizomes also have certain folk medicinal uses in Asia.  In the U.S., rhizomes are generally available for purchase in most Asian groceries.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Languas galanga.Genus name honors Italian botanist Prospero Alpino (1553-1616).
