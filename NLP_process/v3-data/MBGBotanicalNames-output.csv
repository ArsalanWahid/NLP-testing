Culture
Annual that is easily grown in moist, moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Best flowering is in full sun.  Thrives in hot summer climates.  Seeds are sensitive to cold temperatures and should not be planted outside until soil temperatures have risen to 60 degree F. and night temperatures no longer dip below 55 degrees F.  As an alternative, seed may be started indoors about 1-2 weeks prior to last frost date with seedling planted outside as soon as soils warm.  Harvest the pods when they reach 3"" long.  First harvest of okra will occur about 55 days after seeds sprout.  Seed may be harvested from garden plants for planting the following year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abelmoschus esculentus, commonly called okra, is native to tropical Africa and Asia. It is an annual that typically grows 3-5' tall. It is grown for harvest of its edible fruit/seed pods which are perhaps best noted as the signature ingredient in gumbo. Species plants feature hibiscus-like yellow flowers (to 2-3” wide) with purplish centers. Cultivars expand the available flower colors to include attractive shades of pink, orange-red and red often with white centers. Flowers last only for one day, but plants bloom freely throughout the growing season to frost. Flowers give way to fruit capsules which have a musky aroma, hence the common name. Hairy, dark green leaves are deeply cut into 3-7 lobes.Genus name is believed to come from the Arabic abu-l-mosk in reference to the smell of the seeds.Specific epithet means good to eat or edible.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids.  Corn earworm.  Watch for spider mites, slugs and whiteflies.  Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils.  Susceptible to powdery mildew.   Some people develop skin rashes when working with this plant (wear gloves to avoid contact with stems and leaves).

Best grown in rich, consistently moist, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Trees grow poorly in heavy clay soils. Trees are native to cool climates, and are not recommended for planting in the hot and humid summer conditions south of USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies balsamea, commonly called balsam fir, is native to moist woods and bottomlands from Labrador to Alberta south to northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, New England, New York and further south in the Appalachians to Virginia.  It is a primary component of the boreal forest that stretches across Canada.  This is an aromatic, symmetrical, narrow, pyramidal to conical evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown.  It typically grows to 50-70' (less frequently to 90') tall and to 15-25' wide.  It appears, albeit in a diminished shrubby form, as far north as the timber line.  Resinous branches are densely clad with flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1"" long).  Needles are unstalked with circular bases and are white-banded beneath.  Smooth gray-brown bark (greenish when young but brown and scaly on older trees) is covered with blisters which contain a sticky aromatic resin.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 2-4"" long) appear at the crown.  Cones are purple when young.  As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.  Cones disintegrate (scales drop) after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet refers to the fragrant quality of the tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include Balsam woolly adelgids, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight. Trees are generally intolerant of urban pollution.
","

Culture
Best grown in rich, medium moisture, slightly acidic, sandy/gravelly, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Established trees tolerate some soil dryness, but best performance usually comes with moist soils. Trees generally grow poorly in heavy clay soils. This tree thrives in areas with long winters followed by cool summer climates, and it usually does not grow well in the heat and humidity south of USDA Zone 7. It is, however, considered to be the best of the firs for tolerating the growing conditions of the Midwest.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies concolor, commonly called white fir or concolor fir, is primarily native to mountain slopes (3000-9000 feet in elevation) in the western U.S., including the southern Cascades and Sierras from Oregon to southern California and the Rockies from southern Idaho to Arizona and New Mexico. In the wild, it typically grows to 80-130’ tall, but on residential landscapes in the Midwest will more typically grow to 40-70’ tall with a spread to 20-30’. This is a narrow conical conifer with a straight trunk, spire-like crown and branching to the base. Upper branches tend to grow upward, but the lower branches tend to recline. With age, crowns flatten and lower branching begins to disappear. Soft, flattened, pale blue-green needles (to 2 1/2” long) have uniform coloration on both surfaces (specific epithet is in reference to this). Slightly barrel-shaped cones (to 3-6” long) are most often yellowish-green, maturing to brown or purple. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches. Trees may not produce cones and seeds for up to the first 40 years. Bark is ash-gray and smooth, but will furrow with age.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet means the same color throughout.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include balsam woolly adelgid, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions. Disease problems include root rot, needle rust and twig blight. Trees are generally intolerant of urban pollution. Broken branches often become sites for fungal infections. Strong winds may damage taller trees.

Best grown in rich, consistently moist, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in full sun, but appreciates some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Likes moist cool locations, but, unlike most other species of fir, does respectably well in the hot and humid weather conditions of the deep South.  Tolerates heavy clay soils.  New growth in April is susceptible to damage from late spring frosts.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies firma, commonly called momi fir or Japanese fir, is a large, aromatic, conical-pyramidal, needled evergreen conifer that typically grows to 100-150’ tall in its native habitat.  It is likely to mature to a much smaller height (to 40-60’ tall) in cultivation in the U.S.  Branches on younger trees are ascending, but become more horizontal with age.  This fir is native to hills and mountain slopes in central to southern Japan from near sea level to about 6,000’ where it grows in a variety of locations on both dry and moist sites.  It is the most widely distributed fir in Japan where it is considered to be an important timber tree (flooring, crates, and paper pulp). 

Needles (to 1 1.5” long) are strongly two ranked, appearing like a 2-sided comb, forming a wide V shape on the lower twigs.  Needles on young trees are tipped by two sharp prickles at the apex.  Scaly, rough, fissured bark is gray, but becomes corky as it darkens with age.  Flowers appear in April-May.  Conical seed cones (to 3.5 to 5” long) emerge green in spring, but mature to yellowish-brown and are erect and showy throughout summer.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.  Much smaller cylindrical pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to the firm needles.Momi is the Japanese word for fir.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale.  This species appears immune to attack from the balsam woolly adelgid which is a significant problem for some other species of fir.  Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.  Potential disease problems include cankers, heart rot, root rot, needle rust and twig blight.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies fraseri, commonly called Fraser fir, is native to a very small area of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee extending into the southwestern corners of Virginia and West Viginia. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 4500’ to 6900’. It is the only fir that is indigenous to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although rare in nature, Fraser fir is one of the most popular Christmas trees sold in commerce today, and is commonly grown in tree farms for that purpose. This is a narrow, pyramidal, evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown. It grows to 30-50’ tall over time with a spread of 10-25’. It is very similar to balsam fir (Abies balsamea), the primary difference being in the bracts of the cone scales. Flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1” long) are white-banded beneath. Needles are densely borne on resinous stems. Resin blisters may appear on the bark, giving rise to a regional common name of she-balsam for this tree. Seed cones are purple with conspicuously protruding bracts. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet and common name honor John Fraser (1750-1811), Scottish botanist and plant collector, who discovered this plant and introduced it to Britain.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Balsam woolly adelgid has been responsible for killing a number of trees in the wild. Additional insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies grandis, commonly called grand fir, is a large, evergreen fir with a spire crown in youth that typically rounds into a multiple-leadered dome with age.  It is native to moist coastal bottomlands and alpine slopes from sea level to 6000’ in elevation in the Pacific Northwest from southwestern British Columbia south to northern California and in a disjunct population in the Rocky Mountains from southeastern British Columbia to central Idaho and far northwestern Montana.  It will grow to 200-250’ tall with a 4-6’ trunk diameter in Pacific coniferous forests and alpine slopes in coastal areas west of the cascades (greatest height is in coniferous rain forests on the Olympic peninsula of Washington), but to 130-160’ with a 2-4’ trunk diameter in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and in the Rocky Mountains.   This is one of the tallest firs in the world, hence the common name.  

Smooth gray bark develops ridges and furrows as it ages to brown.  Flat needles (to 2 1/2” long) are shiny dark green above with two white stomatal lines beneath.  Needles have blunt to slightly notched tips.  Needles emit a balsamy, tangerine-like aroma when crushed, hence the additional common name of stinking fir for this tree.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 4.5” long) stand upright above the needles near the tips of the upper branches, emerging green in spring, but maturing to yellowish-brown sometimes tinged blue-gray to purple.  Oblong pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils under the needles.  Pollen cones are pale yellow.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to large tree size.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  The balsam woolly adelgid is a significant problem in some areas.  Additional potential insect pests include bark beetles, spruce budworms, tussock moths, aphids, bagworms and scale.  Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acacia koa, commonly known as koa, is a large, fast-growing, evergreen tree of the pea family that is native to the Hawaiian Islands where it typically matures to 50-80’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with a dense broad-spreading crown.  It is usually found in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 300’ to 7000’ on the larger Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and Hawaii).  It is the second most common tree in the Hawaiian Islands.  

Mature trees have stiff, dull green, sickle-shaped, evergreen phyllodes (to 6” long and 1” wide) rather than leaves.  Phyllodes are modified leaf stems that function as leaves.  The true leaves of this tree (each with 12 to 15 paired, twice compound, pea-like leaflets) are only found on juvenile saplings.  Pale yellow flowers with globose heads (each to 3/8” in diameter) bloom in axillary racemes over the outer part of the crown.  Bloom time depends upon a number of factors including elevation, weather conditions and soil moisture.  Flowers may appear year round in some locations or late winter to early summer in others.  Flowers give way to thin, flat, seed pods (about 3-7” long and 1” wide) which mature to brown.  Each pod contains around 12 seeds. 

Koa is the best known timber tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.  Early Hawaiians made long dugout canoes from the wood of tall trees.  Wood is currently used for a variety of other purposes including furniture, cabinets, veneers, wood carvings, musical instruments and picture frames.  Timber from this tree is sometimes called Hawaiian mahogany in honor of its decorative wood (beautifully grained in shades of red, golden brown and brown).  It is one of the most expensive woods in the world today (low supply translates into high cost).  Most commercial harvest of Koa trees is currently limited to the island of Hawaii.  Timber cutting, land clearing and introduced pests have contributed to the decline of this species in the Hawaiian Islands.Genus name come from the Greek name for Acacia arabica.Specific epithet is a native Hawaiian name meaning bold, brave and fearless.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problem. Koa moth can be destructive.  Watch for twig borers, fungi and koa wilt.
","
Garden Uses
Interesting landscape tree for subtropical areas.  Has been successfully grown in a number of California areas.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10 to 11. In its native area, it tolerates a wide range of soil conditions from acidic to slightly alkaline and will grow in sand, loam or clay. It has moderate drought tolerance and poor salt tolerance and will grow in full sun to part shade. In the St. Louis area, it must be grown in containers which can be placed outside on decks and patios during warm weather or it can be grown indoors year-round in an area that receives bright, indirect light. When placed outside, avoid direct afternoon sun. In winter, plants benefit from misting to maintain higher humidity levels, but do not spray flowers. They are relatively trouble free, but watch for mealybugs, red spider mites and scale. Prune severely to 4 to 8 inches in spring to encourage new growth and increased bloom; remove spent flowers. Indoors, keep soil moderately moist, but not soggy. Feed monthly from March to September.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acalypha hispida, commonly called chenille plant, is a beautiful flowering plant that has a long bloom period. The flowers, which droop in cattail-like pendent clusters up to 18 inches in length are bright red to deep pink. In zones 10 to 11 it is a vigorous, upright, coarse-textured shrub that usually attains a height of 5 to 6 feet that is commonly used as an accent, hedge, specimen or container plant. In St. Louis, it is a good container, hanging basket and greenhouse plant, when taken indoors in the fall. Its long period of bloom makes it a showy centerpiece for any tropical or subtropical garden. It features leaves that are 6 to 8 inches long, ovate and medium green.Genus name comes from the Greek name for nettles because of the nettle-like appearance of the leaves.Specific epithet means bristly in probable reference to the bristly nature of the leaves. Another common name for this species is bristly copperleaf.
","
Problems
For best indoor success, very high humidity should be maintained. Also, spider mites, mealybugs and scale may be a problem when grown indoors. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In St. Louis, grow in containers or baskets on decks, patios or rooftop gardens. It is a good plant for color and should be used as an accent for both color and texture in a container. Or, it can be grown year-round in a greenhouse or sun room giving the area a tropical feel.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10. In St. Louis, best grown as annual bedding plants or in containers which can be overwintered indoors. In the ground, grow in moist, average to moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage color in full sun. Soils must be kept consistently moist. If soils dry out, rapid leaf drop usually occurs. Stems may be pinched to control size and shape and to promote bushiness. Take tip cuttings in late summer to overwinter. Container plants may also be overwintered as houseplants as long as they receive intense bright light and soils are kept uniformly moist.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acalypha wilkesiana is native to Fiji and neighboring South Pacific islands. It is an evergreen, often suckering, tropical shrub or subshrub that may grow to 10-15’ tall and as wide in frost free areas. It is typically grown as an annual in St. Louis where it will grow 2-4’ tall in a single growing season. As the common name suggests, this shrub is grown for its attractive foliage which features shiny, coarsely-toothed, oval to elliptic, bronze-green leaves (5-8” long) that are mottled with red and purple or red and bronze. Insignificant green flowers, sometimes tinged with reddish-pink, appear in slender spikes to 8” long. 

Synonymous with A. tricolor.Genus name comes from the Greek name for nettles because of the nettle-like appearance of the leaves.Specific epithet honors Admiral Charles Wilkes who explored the South Pacific in the 1800s.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in average, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants tolerate a wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones. Plants may not flower well in too much shade. Late spring frosts can impair or eliminate flowering for the year. Remove flowering stalks after bloom. In cold winter areas, plant foliage should be left in place over winter but removed in early spring as new foliage appears. Plants can spread aggressively by creeping rootstocks, particularly in loose soils. Unwanted spread can be addressed by root barriers. Plants generally spread less in the northern parts of their growing range. Plants are best propagated from root cuttings taken in early spring, but may be grown from seed. Plants can be slow to establish in the garden (particularly if started from seed), but become somewhat difficult to eradicate once established since small sections of root left behind can sprout new plants. This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area. If attempted in St. Louis, it should be sited in a protected location and mulched.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acanthus mollis, commonly known as bear’s breeches, is a clump-forming perennial that is grown as much for its attractive foliage as for its architecturally bold flower spikes.  It is native to the Mediterranean region.  Creamy white (sometimes pink) snapdragon-like flowers, each hooded and subtended by spiny reddish-purple bracts, bloom in late spring to midsummer in vertical rows on substantial flower spikes that rise well above the foliage mound to 3-5’ tall.  Deeply lobed, soft-spiny, glossy, dark green leaves (to 2’ long) form a mound of basal foliage.  Foliage is mostly evergreen in warm winter climates, but plants lose their leaves when winter temperatures dip below 20 degrees F.  

Acanthus leaves have a classical appearance and were the source of the Corinthian leaf motif developed and used as a decoration in ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture.  It is believed that the leaves of A. mollis or A. spinosis were the model for the sculptured leaves that adorn the capitals of the Corinthian columns that became popular in the 4th century B.C.Genus name comes from the Greek word akantha meaning spine in reference to the toothed edges on leaves in some species.Specific epithet means with soft hairs.There appears to be no scholarly agreement among authorities on the origin and meaning of the term bear’s breeches.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Snails and slugs are occasional visitors that can do substantial damage if left unchecked. Plants can spread aggressively in optimum conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Bold, stately plants that may be grown as specimens but are perhaps best in small groupings. Borders or formal gardens. For the St. Louis area, A. spinosus is a similar plant with better winter hardiness.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. Not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where a winter mulch is advisable. Easily grown from seed or may be propagated by root cuttings best taken in early spring. Can spread aggressively by creeping rootstocks, particularly in loose soils. Can be slow to establish in the garden, but somewhat difficult to eradicate once established since small sections of root left behind can sprout new plants.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acanthus spinosus, commonly called bear's breeches, is a clump-forming perennial which is grown as much for its attractive foliage as for its architecturally bold flower spikes. Features pure white, snapdragon-like flowers enclosed (hooded and subtended) by spiny, reddish-purple bracts and arranged in vertical rows on substantial flower spikes which rise well above the foliage mound to 3-4' tall. Blooms from late spring into mid summer. Deeply-cut, arching, glossy green, spiny, thistle-like leaves (2-3' long) form an ornamental mound of long-stalked, basal foliage which usually remains attractive throughout the growing season. Similar in appearance to Acanthus hungaricus ( A. balcanicus), except the leaves of A. spinosus are more deeply cut and have rigid spines (hence the species name) at the lobe tips. 

Acanthus leaves have a classical appearance and were the source of the Corinthian leaf motif developed and used as a decoration in ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture.Genus name comes from the Greek word akantha meaning spine in reference to the toothed edges on leaves in some species.Specific epithet means spiny in reference to the rigid spines on the leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in average, slightly acidic, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, well-drained soils.  Intolerant of drought.  Propagation is difficult (approximately 95% of seed produced is not viable).  Woody cuttings are difficult to root, but juvenile cuttings are easier to root.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer griseum, commonly called paperbark maple, is a small, deciduous, oval to oval-rounded tree with slender upright branching.  It is particularly noted for its exfoliating copper orange to cinnamon reddish/brown bark and its showy orange to red fall color.  It typically matures to 20-30 (40)’ tall.  It is native to mixed forests in central China.  Bark on the trunk and limbs is extremely ornamental because it peels into large curls which remain on the tree rather that falling to the ground, often in attractive contrast to the tan to rose-brown inner bark.  Each trifoliate leaf (3-5” long) features three coarsely toothed leaflets, with the middle leaflet being short-stalked.  Leaves are green above, but frosty blue-green to gray-green with fine hairs beneath.  Fall color varies, typically ranging from showy shades of orange and red to less spectacular shades of reddish-green to bronze green.  Ornamentally insignificant yellowish flowers bloom in April-early May in clusters (drooping cymes to 1” long) on pendulous downy stalks.  Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1 1/4” long) with unusually large seeds.

E. H. (“Chinese”) Wilson brought this tree from China to England in 1899.  It was introduced in the U. S. shortly thereafter by the Arnold Arboretum.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word griseus meaning gray in reference to color of the leaf undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent small tree for small properties.  Deserves a location where its ornamental features can be appreciated (near a deck or patio).  Appropriate as an understory tree in a woodland garden or as a specimen in many locations around the home.  Popular bonsai subject, particularly in Europe.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer japonicum, commonly called full moon maple, is a deciduous, spreading, small tree or large shrub that grows to 20-30’ tall.  It often grows in a multi-trunked form.  It is native to mountainous areas of Japan, Manchuria and Korea.  It features rounded, palmate, almost fern-like, medium green leaves (to 3-6” across) which are deeply divided (approximately 1/3 of distance to the leaf base) into 7-11 acuminate, toothed and cut, ovate to lance-shaped lobes.  Leaves turn yellow and red in fall.  Each rounded leaf purportedly resembles a full moon, hence the common name.  Small purplish-red flowers in pendulous corymbs appear in early spring (April) before the leaves.  Flowers are followed by winged samaras (to 1” long) which ripen in late summer to early fall.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet indicates native to Japan.Species plants are rarely offered in cultivation, but several popular cultivars are commonly sold, including ‘Aconitifolium’ and 'Vitifolium'.

Easily grown in moist, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, well-drained soils in cool summer temperatures reminiscent of those typically found in its native environment in the Pacific Northwest, but tolerates a variety of soil conditions ranging from moist to somewhat dry.   Does not always perform well in the hot and humid summer conditions found in the southeastern U.S. where it is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer macrophyllum, commonly called bigleaf maple or Oregon maple, is a medium to large, deciduous tree with an oval to broad-rounded crown that typically grows to 40-75’ tall, but occasionally soars to 100’ tall.  Overall, it is considered to be the most massive of the various species of maple found in North America.  Gray to reddish-brown bark on mature trees is deeply furrowed.  It is native to moist to dry sites from British Columbia to southern California, most commonly being found in moist woods and along streams in the lower elevations of the coastal ranges and northern Sierra Nevada mountains.  This tree is rarely found growing more than 200 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.  Trees in moist forested areas in western parts of the Pacific Northwest are often covered with mosses, lichens and ferns.  

Deeply 5-lobed (occasionally 3-lobed) leaves (to 8-12” long and wide) emerge with burgundy tones in spring, mature to glossy medium to deep green, and finally turn yellow to yellow-orange in fall. Leaves found on this tree are the largest found on any species of maple, hence the common name of big leaf maple.  Leaf stalks contain a milky sap.  Fragrant greenish-yellow flowers (each to 1/3” across) bloom in April-May in 4-8” long pendant, cylindrical, chain-like clusters (racemes), with each cluster having up to 175 tiny flowers.  Flowers bloom as the new burgundy-tinted leaves are developing, providing an often attractive color contrast.  Flowers give way to two-winged samaras (each to 1 1/2” long) with wings spreading to 60 degrees.  Samaras mature by autumn.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and phyllon meaning leaf in obvious reference to the huge leaves found on this tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Powdery mildew and verticillium wilt can pose problems in some areas.  Shallow spreading roots can crack sidewalks and driveways.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent shade tree for large landscapes and parks.  Wood is commercially used for lumber and to make furniture, veneer, cabinets, paneling and floors.  Saplings make excellent browse for deer and elk.  Seeds are eaten by chipmunks, squirrels, mice and some birds.   Sap may be used to make maple syrup, however in order to produce a given volume of syrup, a  much larger amount of sap must be taken from this tree than from Acer saccharum (the sugar maple of Eastern North America) which has a much larger concentration of sugar in its sap.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor dry ones. Intolerant of shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer negundo, commonly known as box elder, is a suckering, fast-growing, weak-wooded, medium-sized, deciduous tree that typically grows 30-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with an irregular rounded crown.  It is widely distributed throughout the U.S. except in Alaska and Hawaii.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams, river flood plains and low woods (Steyermark).  Although it is a maple and produces the familiar maple fruits (paired samaras), it differs from most maples by having odd-pinnate compound leaves (each with 3-5 toothed leaflets) and by being dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Leaves with three leaflets are most common, and these resemble poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).  Leaves are light to medium green, turning an undistinguished yellow in fall.  Greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendant clusters in spring on separate male and female trees. Flowers are not showy.  Female flowers give way to fruits (samaras) which mature in fall and often persist on the tree well into winter.  Fruiting can be abundant.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Sanskrit and Bengali word nirgundi, which was used as negundo in the naming of Vitex negundo and later for this maple that has a leaf similar to that of Vitex negundo.The name box elder (sometimes boxelder) is in reference to a use of the wood for making crates and boxes and the supposed similarity of the leaves to those of elder (Sambucus). Leaves also resemble those of some ashes, hence the additional common name of ash-leaved maple.
","
Problems
This tree is a host for boxelder bugs, which do not harm the tree but can be a significant nuisance to homeowners if the tree is located near the home. Also susceptible to borers. Anthracnose, powdery mildew and canker are occasional disease problems. Weak-wooded branches may break in high winds or from the weight of ice/snow, sometimes severely damaging the shape of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Could be used as a shade tree. Generally recommended only for difficult corners of the landscape where other trees of superior ornamental value will not grow or in cold northern climates such as North Dakota where many deciduous shade trees are hard to grow. Male trees are generally considered to be superior landscape plants to female trees because they lack the messy flowers and somewhat unsightly seed clusters of the female trees.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in sandy loams.  May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range.  New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist.  Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Avoid hot and dry sites.  Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge.  Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter.  Spring or summer pruning often  results in significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching.  Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes.  Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April).  The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance.  Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs.  Samaras ripen in September-October.  Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze.  Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.
","
Problems
Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots.  Potential insect pests include  aphids, scale, borers, bagworms, and root weevils.  Mites may be troublesome.  Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late spring frosts.  Chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.
","
Garden Uses

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer pensylvanicum commonly known as snakebark maple is a shrubby understory maple that is native to moist, rocky forests from Wisconsin to Quebec and south in the Appalachians to Georgia. It typically grows as a large shrub or small tree to 15-25’ tall (less frequently to 40’ tall) with a rounded but uneven crown that is sometimes flat-topped. This is the only species of snakebark maple that is native to North America. Key ornamental features are its interesting bark and fall color. Greenish bark on young branches and young trunks is vertically marked with distinctive white stripes (hence the common names of snakebark maple and striped maple). Stripes may vanish over time as older bark turns reddish brown. Obovate, double-serrulate, three-lobed leaves (to 7” long) emerge with pink hues in spring, mature to dark green by summer and turn bright yellow in fall. Leaf purportedly resembles a goose foot, hence the common name of goosefoot maple for this plant. Small yellow flowers (1/3” diameter) bloom in pendant racemes (to 6” long) in spring (May). Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1” long). Moose and white tailed deer often browse the leaves and young twigs hence the common name of moosewood. Whistles can easily be carved from branch sections, hence the common name of whistlewood.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Although misspelled by Linnaeus, the specific epithet is in fact a reference to the State of Pennsylvania where this tree is native.
","
Problems
Leaves may scorch in full sun locations. Potential disease problems include verticillium wilt, leaf spots, tar spot, canker and root rots. Potential insect problems include aphids, scale, borers and caterpillars. Mites may appear.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Tolerant of heat and drought. Generally tolerant of many urban pollutants. Freely reseeds. Trees have escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S. Shallow root system.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer platanoides, commonly called Norway maple, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in urban areas throughout much of the U.S. It is a medium-sized deciduous shade tree typically growing 40-50’ tall with a dense, symmetrical, rounded crown. Leaves (to 7” across) have five sharply pointed lobes and resemble those of sugar maple. Leaf stems exude a milky sap when cut. Fall color is usually an unremarkable yellow. Small yellow flowers in erect clusters (corymbs) appear in spring before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired seeds with horizontally spreading wings (samaras to 2” long).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means resembling platanus (sycamore), which is somewhat curious since the leaves of Norway maple do not really bear that much resemblance to sycamores.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt which is usually fatal. Shallow root system can crack or heave nearby driveways or sidewalks. Shallow surface roots can interfere with turf. Bark is susceptible to sunscald and cracking (frost cracks) in winter, particularly on younger trees. The thick canopy of leaves and shallow roots severely limits what can be grown within the drip line of the tree.

Samaras mature in early autumn.  Bark on mature trunks will flake, exposing inner orange bark.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means false sycamore (pseudo meaning false and platanus being the genus for sycamore).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Canker is the most significant potential disease problem.
","
Garden Uses
This may not be the best selection for the landscape since it is not particularly ornamental and has poor fall color. It may be used as a shade tree. It is often planted along the east coast because of its tolerance for salt spray.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer rubrum, commonly called red maple, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Eastern North America from Quebec to Minnesota south to Florida and eastern Texas.  It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a rounded to oval crown.  It grows faster than Norway and sugar maples, but slower than silver maple.  In northern states, red maple usually occurs in wet bottomland, river flood plains and wet woods, but in Missouri it typically frequents drier, rocky upland areas.  Emerging new growth leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit and fall color are red or tinged with red.  Quality of red fall color on species plants is variable.  Leaves (to 2-5"" long) have 3 principal triangular lobes (sometimes 5 lobes with the two lower lobes being largely suppressed).  Lobes have toothed margins and pointed tips.  Leaves are medium to dark green above and gray green below.  Flowers on a given tree are primarily male or female or monoecious and appear in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves.  Fruit is a two-winged samara.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet of rubrum meaning red is everywhere in evidence: red flowers in dense clusters in late March to early April (before the leaves appear), red fruit (initially reddish, two-winged samara), reddish stems and twigs, red buds, and, in the fall, excellent orange-red foliage color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, leafhoppers, borers, scale and caterpillars.  Verticillium wilt attacks the vascular system and can be fatal.  Canker, fungal leaf spot and root rots may also occur.  Wind and ice may break some branches. Leaf hoppers can cause substantial damage.
","
Garden Uses
Plant as a specimen tree for the lawn, street or park. It is of note that this tree has a shallow, flattened root system that may buckle nearby sidewalks or driveways if planted too close.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist soils, but shows somewhat surprising tolerance for poor dry soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharinum commonly known as silver maple gets its name from the silvery undersides of its leaves. This is one of the largest deciduous trees native to Missouri, typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a rounded open spreading crown. It is native to eastern and central North America where it typically occurs in moist to wet, sometimes mucky, often poorly drained soils on floodplains, along the edges of streams and rivers and in low woods. It is a fast-growing, somewhat graceful tree that formerly was a very popular urban landscape selection for lawns and streets, but has more recently fallen somewhat out of favor because of the proclivity of its weak-wooded limbs to split when stressed by high winds or ice/snow. Polygamous greenish yellow flowers bloom in clusters in early spring (March) before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired samaras (to 2” long) that mature in late spring. Bark is gray to brownish gray. Mature tree trunks and limbs develop a shaggy appearance as the bark develops long thin flaky scales that exfoliate at the ends. Deeply 5-lobed light green leaves (to 6” across) have silvery undersides. Fall color is usually unremarkable. Tree sap is sweet, hence the species name which comes from the Latin word for sugar, but syrups made therefrom are greatly inferior to those made from sugar maple (Acer saccharum).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose and canker. Also susceptible to scale and borers. As with many fast growing trees, silver maple has weak brittle branches that are susceptible to breaking in high winds or when coated with ice/snow in winter. Shallow roots may damage nearby sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful large landscape tree. Weak wood is a concern. Perhaps best sited in areas of poor soil or low wet conditions where other stronger wooded trees will not grow.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharum commonly known as sugar maple is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which will typically grow 40' to 80' tall (sometimes to 100') with a dense, rounded crown. This tree is a main component of the Eastern U.S. hardwood forest and is one of the trees which is most responsible for giving New England its reputation for spectacular fall color. Medium green leaves (3-6"" wide with 3-5 lobes) turn yellow-orange in autumn, sometimes with considerable color variations. Fruit is the familiar two-winged samara. Sugar maples are long-lived trees which grow relatively slowly (somewhat faster in the first 35 years). Native Americans taught the early colonists how to tap these trees to make maple syrup which has now become a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and Canada. Excellent shade tree.  The sugar maple leaf is the national symbol of Canada.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap. Saccharum is the genus name for sugarcane.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose, cankers, leaf spot and tar spot. Also susceptible to aphids, borers and scale. Leaf scorch may be a problem in drought conditions. Has been frequently used as a street tree, but is generally intolerant of road salt, soil compaction and pollution.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent specimen tree for the lawn or parks with beautiful fall color. May be used as a street tree as long as it can be located on a street and in a location where road salt, soil compaction and pollution will not be significant problems.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer tataricum, commonly called Tatarian maple, typically grows as a small, upright spreading tree with a dense, rounded crown or as a large multi-stemmed shrub.  It matures over time to 15-20’ tall.  It is native to forested areas from western Asia to southeastern Europe.  Unlobed, broad-ovate, medium green leaves (to 4” long) with irregular doubly serrate margins are found on mature trees.  Leaves on young trees are often 3 lobed.  Leaves turn yellow and red in fall.  Greenish-white flowers in erect, long-peduncled panicles bloom in spring.  Flowers are followed by winged samaras (to 1” long) that turn a showy red in summer/fall as they mature.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to certain areas of Siberia and Mongolia (Tatary) that were invaded and occupied in the Middle Ages by the Tatars.Acer tataricum subsp. ginnala and its cultivars are more often found in cultivation than A. tataricum.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Verticillium wilt, stem canker, leaf spots, tar spot and anthracnose may appear. Watch for aphids, borers, scale, leafhoppers, caterpillers and mites. Plants have escaped cultivation and naturalized by self-seeding in certain parts of the eastern U.S.

Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens. Cultivars also extend the range of flower colors to include pinks, reds, creams, yellows and bicolor pastels.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.The specific epithet millefolium means ""thousand-leaved"" in reference to the highly dissected foliage.Common yarrow has a large number of additional common names, including milfoil, thousandleaf, soldier’s woundwort, bloodwort, nose bleed, devil’s nettle, sanguinary, old-man’s-pepper and stenchgrass.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Plant stems are weak and lodge easily. If grown ornamentally, plants can develop into a tangled mass of stems and foliage by mid to late summer if not cut back. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can easily flatten exposed plantings. May spread somewhat aggressively.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, wild gardens, meadows, prairies and naturalized areas. Good fresh cut or dried flower.This species is generally considered to be too weedy for borders. Can be used as a flowering ground cover or lawn for sunny out-of-the-way areas (mow as needed with rotary mower on high setting).

Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained sandy loams in full sun.  Plants do well in average to lean garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good.  Avoid heavy clay soils and moist, rich, fertile soils.  Plants tolerate hot, humid summers and drought.  Plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds.  Deadhead spent flower heads to lateral buds to promote additional bloom.  Cut plants back to basal leaves after flowering to tidy the planting and to encourage possible additional fall bloom.  Divide clumps when they become overcrowded (every 3-4 years).  Propagate species by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea sibirica is an upright, tufted, perennial yarrow that is native to Siberia.  It typically grows to 12-30"" tall.  Flowers (to 3/8"" diameter) bloom in summer in dense corymbs (2-4"" across) atop stems rising to 12-30"" tall.  Each small flower features dull white disk flowers which are surrounded by white rays.  Pinnately dissected leaves (to 3"" long) are sessile, deeply toothed and lanceolate.The genus name Achillea refers to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.Specific epithet rerfers to Siberia which is part of its native range.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems.  Strong summer rain storms with high winds can damage exposed plantings.  If stems flop or become matted, they can be cut back.
","
Garden Uses
Yarrow grows well in sunny, hot and dry locations.  Group or mass in beds, borders or cottage gardens.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Soils must not be allowed to dry out, but need sufficient drainage to prevent wet conditions from developing. Best in full sun in cool summer climates. Appreciates some afternoon shade in the St. Louis area. Needs cool nights below 70 degrees F. to grow well, and, like the related delphiniums, will often struggle in hot St. Louis summers. Cut back stems after flowering to encourage an additional late season bloom. Although plants may be propagated by division, they are often slow to establish and are probably best left undisturbed once planted.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aconitum carmichaelii is native to central China and is sometimes commonly called autumn-flowering monkshood because of its late summer to early fall bloom. It blooms later than most other species of Aconitum. It is an erect, tuberous-rooted perennial that features dense panicles (to 8” long) of hooded flowers atop rigid, leafy stems typically growing 2-3’ tall. In optimum growing conditions, plants may grow 4-5’ tall. Species flowers are deep purple inside and paler blue outside. The upper sepal of each flower develops into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower. Leathery, dark green leaves are deeply divided into 3-5 lobes. All parts of the plant (especially the roots and seeds) are extremely poisonous. Arendsii group hybrids (A. carmichaelii x A. carmichaelii var. wilsonii) feature uniformly deep azure blue flowers. Species is sometimes sold as A. fischeri.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoniton used for these poisonous herbs.Specific epithet honors medical doctor and plant collector Dr. J.R. Carmichael (d. 1877).The upper sepal of each flower develops into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Crown rot, powdery mildew and verticillium wilt are occasional problems. Generally does not need staking or other support. WEAR GLOVES WHEN WORKING WITH THIS PLANT. Avoid skin or oral contact with plant juices, and be particularly careful to cover up any open cuts or skin abrasions prior to entering garden areas.
","
Garden Uses
In the St. Louis area, this plant needs consistently moist soils and may be best grown in moist woodland areas, along streams or ponds, or on the periphery of bog or water gardens. Will grow in borders as long as the soil moisture requirements can be met. Because of the poisonous properties of the plant, it probably should not be grown in areas where small children might come in contact with it or in areas contiguous to vegetable gardens where tubers are growing.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aconitum napellus is an erect, tuberous-rooted perennial which features dense, terminal racemes (to 8"" long) of hooded, deep purplish-blue to violet flowers atop rigid, leafy stems typically growing 2-4' tall. Commonly found in moist pastures and moist mountainous areas of Europe and Asia. Dark green leaves are deeply divided into 5-7 toothed lobes. The sepals and petals of the flowers are similarly colored, with the upper sepal developing into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower. Also sometimes commonly called wolfsbane because this plant was once used as an arrow poison and in a poison bait for killing wolves. All parts of the plant (especially the roots and seeds) are extremely poisonous. The drug aconite is made from the leaves and roots of this species and was once prescribed as a cardiac and respiratory sedative.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoniton used for these poisonous herbs.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant having tuberous roots.The upper sepal of each flower develops into a large, helmet-like structure that somewhat resembles the hood worn by medieval monks, hence the common names of monkshood and helmet flower.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Crown rot, powdery mildew and verticillium wilt are occasional problems. Taller stems may need support, particularly if plants are grown in exposed areas. WEAR GLOVES WHEN WORKING WITH THIS PLANT. Avoid skin or oral contact with plant juices, and be particularly careful to cover up any open cuts or skin abrasions prior to entering garden areas.
","
Garden Uses
In the St. Louis area, this plant needs consistently moist soils and may be best grown in moist woodland areas, along streams or ponds, or on the periphery of bog or water gardens. Will grow in borders as long as the soil moisture requirements can be met. Because of the poisonous properties of the plant, it probably should not be grown in areas where small children might come in contact with it or in areas contiguous to vegetable gardens where tubers are growing.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in both boggy conditions (including shallow standing water to 9” deep) and consistently moist garden soils.  In water gardens, plant rhizomes slightly below the soil surface in moist soils at the water’s edge or in containers set in shallow water.  Rhizomes or existing clumps may also be planted in containers sunk into wet boggy areas to help prevent any possible invasive spread.  Scorched leaf tips will occur if soils are allowed to dry out.  Appreciates some relief from hot summer sun (e.g., afternoon shade or filtered sun) when grown in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area.  Slowly naturalizes by creeping rhizomes and can form large colonies in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acorus calamus commonly called sweet flag is a deciduous, spreading, marginal aquatic perennial that features iris-like, sword-shaped leaf blades (to 3/4” wide) typically growing in basal clumps to 30” tall.  It is a sterile triploid.  Although native to Europe, it was introduced into North America by settlers in the 1600s, and has naturalized over time throughout much of the U.S. (particularly in the northeast and central portions) including a number of counties in the State of Missouri.  Mature leaves have one slightly wavy edge and a prominent midrib.  Plants thrive in wet, boggy soils and are commonly grown today as foliage accents in water gardens and pond margins.  Although its foliage resembles that of a large iris, sweet flag is actually a member of the acorus family.  Insignificant tiny greenish flowers appear in elongated inflorescences (spadixes to 2-4"" long without showy spathes), which appear in late spring.  Flowers may give way to tiny fleshy berries.  Foliage and rhizomes are sweetly fragrant when bruised, hence the common name.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoron used for Acorus calamus and Iris pseuodacorus.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's reed-like appearance.Foliage and rhizomes are sweetly fragrant when bruised, hence the common name.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Scorch will occur if soils are not kept consistently moist to wet.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or specimen for water gardens, stream or pond margins, bogs or in moist open woodland gardens.  May also be used in other areas of the landscape, such as low spots, as long as its high soil moisture requirements can be met.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Plants perform well in both boggy conditions (including shallow standing water to 3-4” deep) and consistently moist garden soils. Never allow soils to dry out. Scorched leaf tips and withering leaves are often the first signs of drying soils. In water gardens, plants are typically planted in containers with water covering the crowns or in wet soils at the water’s edge. Plants appreciate some relief from hot summer sun (e.g., afternoon shade or filtered sun) when grown in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Plants will slowly naturalize by spreading rhizomes, but are not considered to be invasive. If grown in containers sunk below the water surface, plants will not spread. Plants are not considered to be reliably winter hardy in the northern parts of USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acorus gramineus is commonly called grassy-leaved sweet flag. It is native to wetland areas of China, Japan, Korea, India, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines. It is a semi-evergreen, marginal aquatic perennial that features a grass-like tuft of narrow, linear leaf blades (1/4“ wide) that fan outward to 6-12” tall. Tiny, insignificant, yellow-green flowers bloom from spring to early summer on lateral, sedge-like flower spikes (spadixes to 2-4"" long). Flowers give way to very tiny, reddish, fleshy berries. Tufts will slowly spread over time by rhizomes to form a dense ground cover. Plants thrive in wet soils and are commonly grown in water gardens and boggy areas for foliage accent or ground cover purposes. Although it looks like a grass and its common name suggests a grassy appearance, grassy-leaved sweet flag is not a member of the grass family. Originally it was assigned to the arum family (which includes calla lily and jack-in-the-pulpit), but recently it has been transferred from arum to its own family called Acoraceae. Transfer from the arum family was in part done because plants in the genus Acorus do not have true spathes as are typically found in arum family members. Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoron used for Acorus calamus and Iris pseuodacorus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning grass.Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Scorch will occur if soils are not kept consistently moist to wet.
","
Garden Uses
Mass as a ground cover in small areas of water gardens, along streams or ponds, bogs or in moist open woodland gardens. Helps control erosion on water banks. Also effective in rock gardens, border fronts, foundations or as small landscape accents as long as the soil moisture requirements can be met. This plant may be used in the landscape in somewhat the same situations as one might use those species of Carex that prefer sun/part shade.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out, but need good drainage to prevent wet conditions from developing. Self-seeding may occur in optimum growing conditions where the berries fall to the ground. If naturalization is desired, berries may be picked and immediately planted into the ground as soon as they ripen in order to promote colonial spread.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actaea pachypoda, commonly known as white baneberry, is a Missouri native perennial that typically grows to 30” tall and is primarily cultivated in woodland and shade gardens for its attractive white berries and astilbe-like foliage. It naturally occurs in deep woods, north-facing wooded slopes, bluff bases and ravines in the eastern part of Missouri (Steyermark). Ternately-compound leaves with toothed leaflets usually remain attractive through most of the growing season. Tiny white flowers appear in spring in short, oblong terminal clusters atop long greenish stems rising above the foliage. Flowering stems thicken after bloom and turn an attractive red as pea-sized white berries develop in summer in elongated clusters. The berries are extremely poisonous if eaten, hence the common name of baneberry. Each berry has a distinctive small dark purplish spot (formed by the flower stigma) which gives rise to another common name of doll’s eyes. Berry toxicity probably is the main reason why wildlife seems to ignore the fruit, with the berry clusters typically persisting on the plants and providing ornamental interest until frost.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet means with a thick foot (stalk).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage decline may occur in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area, particularly if soils are allowed to dry out but also if soils become too wet from periods of heavy rain. Berries are extremely poisonous if ingested, and consideration should be given to avoid planting this species in areas frequented by young children.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers humusy, moisture-retentive soils. Foliage tends to scorch and otherwise depreciate if soils are allowed to dry out. Best sited in a location sheltered from strong winds. This is a slow-to-establish plant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actaea podocarpa is native to moist woods in the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Tennessee and Georgia. It is very similar in appearance to Actaea racemosa, except for very minor differences in the flowers and resulting fruits (A. racemosa flowers have one pistil and A. podocarpa flowers have three pistils). Features ferny, deeply-cut, deep green, 2-3 ternate leaves with 3-lobed, oval to oblong leaflets, on branched stems which form an attractive foliage clump to 3-4’ tall. Flower stems rise well above the foliage clump to a height of 5-6’ bearing terminal, bottlebrush-like, branched racemes (to 20” long) of apetalous, fluffy, creamy white flowers. Flowers have no fragrance. Blooms in late summer to early autumn. Synonymous with and formerly known as Cimicifuga americana. All plants in the genus Cimicifuga have recently been transferred to the genus Actaea.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet is in reference to the fruit being formed on a thick stalk.Many plants in the genus Actaea are commonly called bugbane in reference to the odoriferous insect repellent properties attributed to most plants in the genus.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. When in bloom, the tall flower spires will benefit from staking or other support, particularly if plants are not sited in sheltered locations. Flower spires tend to bend toward bright light, particularly when plants are grown in substantial shade. Leaf margins may brown up (scorch) and growth may slow down if soils are not kept consistently moist.
","
Garden Uses
Flower spires add architectural height to shaded borders, shade gardens, woodland gardens, cottage gardens or naturalized areas. Ferny foliage provides excellent texture and color to the landscape throughout the growing season. Best in groups, although single plants have good specimen value once established.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actaea racemosa, commonly called black cohosh, is an upright, Missouri native perennial which occurs in rocky woods in the Ozark region of the State. It typically grows to a total height (foliage plus flowering spikes) of 4-6’, but under optimum conditions can reach 8’. Small, numerous, creamy white, fragrant flowers appear in late summer to early fall in long, terminal racemes resembling fluffy spires (typically 1-2’ long) rising well above the foliage on wiry stems. Astilbe-like, deeply cut, tripinnate foliage is an attractive deep green. Synonymous with and formerly known as Cimicifuga racemosa. All plants in the genus Cimicifuga have recently been transferred to the genus Actaea.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being produced in racemes.The common name of bugbane is in reference to the odoriferous insect repellant properties of this plant. Cohosh comes from an Algonquin word meaning rough in reference to the appearance of plant rhizomes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rust and leaf spot are occasional problems. Foliage generally does not need staking, but taller flower spires may need some support. Flower spires tend to bend toward bright light, particularly when plants are grown in substantial shade.

","
Garden Uses
Adds architectural height and late summer bloom to a shaded part of the border or shade garden. Also effective in woodland gardens, cottage gardens and naturalized areas. Best in groups, although single plants have good specimen value once established. White flower spires are generally more demonstrative in front of darker backgrounds. Deep green foliage provides excellent texture and color to the landscape throughout the growing season.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Planting in infertile soil may temper somewhat rapid growth habit. Needs frequent pruning, including an annual winter pruning of each stem back to 8-10 buds and an annual summer pruning of excessively long shoots.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actinidia arguta, commonly known as hardy kiwi or tara vine, is a deciduous, fast-growing, twining woody vine that is typically grown for its attractive foliage and edible fruit.  It is native to woodlands, mountain forests, streamsides and moist locations in eastern Asia, China and Japan.  It grows to 25-30' or more, but growth is often so rampant that this vine, in its native habitat, may climb to as much as 100' into large trees.  Broad-ovate to elliptic deep green leaves (3-5"" long) emerge in spring, scented greenish-white flowers (to 3/4"" long) bloom in June and edible grape-sized smooth-skinned fruits (to 1 1/4"" long) mature in September-October.  Species plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants), with at least one male pollinator needed for fruit set on female vines. It tastes similar to, though slightly sweeter than, its larger-fruited relative, the true kiwi, Actinidia deliciosa, which can not be grown north of Zone 8.Genus name comes from the Greek word aktis meaning ray in reference to how the plant growth radiates like the spokes of a wheel.Specific epithet means sharply toothed or notched in reference to the toothed leaves.
","
Problems
No serious disease or insect problems.
","
Garden Uses
This fast growing vine can be grown both for its beautiful foliage and its fruit. Rapid growth habit makes it suitable for a variety of cover-type uses such as on a trellis, arbor, patio overhead, fence, or wall.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 11. North of USDA Zone 11, plants should be grown in containers and overwintered indoors. In containers, desert rose is best grown in a loose, sandy or gravelly, well-drained soil mix in full sun. Plants have excellent heat tolerance. Apply regular moisture during periods of growth, but allow soils to dry between waterings. Regular applications of fertilizer in spring will help promote flowering. Plants can be left outdoors in sunny locations during the summer. As soon as temperatures begin to dip below 55 degrees F. in autumn, bring containers indoors to sunny but cool locations with reduced watering. Plants usually lose their leaves in winter and go into a dormancy-like period. For container plants, the best caudex usually develops from seed-grown plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adenium obesum, commonly called desert rose, is a thick-stemmed sparsely-leaved perennial succulent that is native to semi- arid, sub-Saharan regions of eastern and southwestern Africa plus the Arabian peninsula. In the wild, this plant will eventually rise to 6-9' tall, but will grow much smaller in containers. It forms a broad, swollen, often grotesque caudex (usually partially buried underground) from which rise twisted leafless gray-green to brown branches. Leathery, spirally-arranged, fleshy, ovate, gray-green leaves (to 4"" long) appear at the stem tips. Narrow, bell-shaped, salverform flowers (to 2"" across), each with five spreading lobes and five protruding stamens, are red, pink or rose with white to pale yellow throats. In the wild, flowers bloom in summer with some irregular continued bloom throughout the year. As houseplants, flowers typically bloom only in summer. Milky plant sap is poisonous.Genus name is the Latinized Arabic name aden used for Adenium obesum.Specific epithet means fat or succulent.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Sharp soil drainage is required to prevent possible onset of rots. Additional potential disease problems include fungal leaf spot. Mealybugs, scale and aphids are potential insect pests.

Culture
Grow in consistently moist, neutral to alkaline soils in part shade to full shade. Plants in the wild will sprawl from wet limestone rocks. Native Missouri growing conditions are difficult to duplicate in home gardens. Notwithstanding the U.S. growing range of this plant, it may not be reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum capillus-veneris, commonly called southern maidenhair fern, is a deciduous, clumping fern with a drooping habit that grows to 12-18” tall and slowly spreads by short creeping rhizomes. It features bipinnate to tripinnate fronds with wiry, black stems that are distinctively arching to pendent. Small pinnae (each to 1/2” long) are fan-shaped, having wedge-shaped bases and irregular lobing at the apex. Sori (spores) appear in summer on the reflexed pinnae undermargins. In Missouri, this fern is typically found in moist ledges and crevices of dolomite bluffs and on boulders along streams and rivers in the Ozark Mountains and adjacent areas (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to northern maidenhair fern (Adiantum pedatum), except among other things its fronds are unforked. Soft delicate finely textured foliage is attractive in woodland areas. This fern is native throughout the world in tropical to temperate regions including South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. In the U. S., it is uncommonly found throughout the southern states north to California, South Dakota and Ohio.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning hair (capillus) of Venus (veneris) as reflected by the sometimes used common name of Venus maidenhair fern for this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaves may scorch in direct sun. Fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental fern for shaded areas of woodland or native plant gardens.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Best in bright but sun-dappled or filtered light in sheltered locations with good air circulation.  Part shade is better than full shade.  Container plants grown as houseplants should be placed near sunny windows but not in direct sun.  Foliage may scorch in full sun but growth will lose vigor in too much shade.  Water freely and evenly, but avoid overwatering.  Soils should never be allowed to dry out.  Mist foliage to increase humidity.  Best indoor daytime temperatures are around 70 degrees F., dipping to 60 degrees F. at night.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as rough maidenhair fern, is an evergreen to deciduous fern featuring bipinnate to tripinnate fronds (each to 14” long).  It typically grows in an arching foliage clump to 12-18” tall, spreading over time by wiry, short-creeping rhizomes to form small colonies.  Each frond is divided into narrow pinnae stemming from the center stem of the frond, with each pinna being clad with rough textured, oblong to fan-shaped, medium to dark green pinnules (leaf segments to 1/2” long).  Each pinnule has sori (spores) which appear in summer on the undermargins of the pinnules (6-14 sori per pinnule). This fern is native to shaded rainforest and open rocky sites, often found along rivers and banks, in Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands, tropical Asia and Africa.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the southern U. S. (Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Hawaii).  This fern tends to be deciduous when grown outdoors in temperate conditions of USDA Zones 8-10, but is semi-evergreen to evergreen when grown in semi-tropical to tropical conditions or indoors as a houseplant.  Juvenile foliage emerges showy pink in sharp contrast to the leathery dark green mature foliage, hence the sometimes used additional common name of rosy maidenhair fern.  Pink fronds gradually mature to dark green or bronze green.  Common name of rough maidenhair fern is in reference to its rough-textured foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin hispus meaning hair in reference to the fronds having minutely hairy stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaves may scorch in direct sun.  Rhizome rot may occur in wet soils.  At the other extreme, fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.  Watch for aphids, mealybugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
This is a popular ornamental fern which may be grown outdoors in USDA Zones 8-10 (perhaps Zone 7 if mulched and sheltered in winter) in shaded areas of woodland gardens and/or in containers/hanging baskets in shaded patio areas.  North of Zone 8, it is usually grown indoors as a houseplant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist, humusy, acidic soils in full shade. Spreads slowly by creeping, branching rhizomes to form large colonies over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum pedatum, commonly called northern maidenhair fern, is a deciduous, clump-forming, Missouri native fern which typically grows 1.5 to 2' tall and is most frequently found on rich wooded slopes, ravine bottoms and damp shady woods. Features finely-textured, somewhat frilly fronds which have curved stalks and are palmately-divided (i.e., fronds divide into finger-like projections). Wiry stems are reddish-brown to black. Crosiers (coiled young fiddleheads) emerge pink in spring.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet means cut like a bird's foot in reference to the fronds.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. High summer heat may cause fronds to brown by mid to late summer, particularly if good soil moisture is not maintained and/or plants are grown in too much sun.
","
Garden Uses
Attractive ornamental fern for the shaded border, woodland garden, shaded rock garden or native plant garden. Combine with broad leaves of hostas, caladiums or brunneras. Also effective as an edger along paths in shade gardens.

Culture
This is a perennial fern that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In the St. Louis area, it is typically grown as a houseplant, where it seems to respond best in bright indirect light including diffused sun, but dislikes direct sun. If grown in full shade, foliage will lose its vitality. Use a consistently moist but well-drained potting soil. Roots must never be allowed to dry out. This can be a difficult plant to grow in St. Louis because it needs a very humid atmosphere. Avoid placing plant in drafty areas or in locations near heat registers. Pots may be set in a tray of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Consider siting pots in bathrooms where atmospheric humidity is generally higher. May be grown as a houseplant year around, but sometimes benefits from a winter rest. Remove any browned foliage immediately.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum raddianum, commonly called Delta maidenhair fern, and its cultivars are perhaps the most commonly grown of the non-winter hardy maidenhair ferns. Triangular, 3- or 4-pinnate fronds with dark stalks emerge from a dense rootstock of short, branching rhizomes. Fan-shaped pinnae (leaflets) emerge light green but darken with age. Fronds typically grow to 12” wide and 18” long. Cultivars of this species come in different colors, shapes and forms. Synonymous with and formerly known as Adiantum cuneatum.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet honors Italian botanist Giuseppe Raddi (1770-1829).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale and mealybugs. Leaves may scorch in direct sun. Fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Houseplant that may be considered for bathroom areas and bright areas with some diffused sun. Hanging baskets, pots or containers.

Culture
Best grown in bright but filtered sun to part shade in consistently moist but well-drained soils.  Best with a small pool of water in the central cup formed by the rosette of leaves.  Replace leaf cup water periodically.  Rinse entire plant with water as needed to remove dust build up on leaves.   Best performance occurs with indoor temperatures ranging from low 60s F. at night to 75-80 F. during the day.  Reduce watering in winter.  Remove dead rosettes as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aechmea fasciata, commonly called urn plant or silver vase plant, is an epiphytic bromeliad that is native to southeastern Brazil.  In its native habitat, it will grow in the ground or in trees without taking any nourishment from the tree.  This is a stemless plant that typically grows 1-3' tall in a basal rosette of stiff, arching, broad, strap-shaped, elliptic-oval, silvery-green leaves  which resemble an urn.  Leaf margins have black spines.  An urn plant shoot blooms only once and then dies.  But the bloom is spectacular.  Inflorescence is a dense pyramidal head consisting of small violet flowers  (mature to red) which are surrounded by showy pink bracts.  Bracts remain showy for several months.  Offsets (pups) form at the base of this shoot (mother plant).  Offsets can be transplanted as new plants after the original plant dies (wait until they reach 6"" tall to transplant).   Many cultivars, some featuring variegated leaves, have been developed.Genus name comes from the Greek word aichme meaning a point in reference to the stiff points on the sepals.Specific epithet means bound together.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems.  Watch for scale and mealybugs.    Leaf spot and crown rot may occur, especially during propagation.  Leaf tips will brown up if soils dry out or plants are grown in areas too cold.  Root rot may occur if soils are kept too moist.  If plant will not bloom, place a ripe apple at the base of the plant and cover the plant with a clear plastic bag for about 1-2 weeks (keep plant from sun to avoid overheating).

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in sun or shade. Perhaps best in part shade in the St. Louis area. Foliage will often scorch in hot, dry, full sun conditions. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Flower heads may be removed to prevent self-seeding and to maintain appearance of the ground cover. Any unvariegated shoots which appear should also be removed as they tend to be more vigorous and can quickly take over a planting. If foliage declines in summer, plantings may be sheared by mowing on a high setting to remove the unsightly leaves and to stimulate new foliage growth. Spreads by underground stems (rhizomes) and can be quite aggressive. If not grown in self-contained areas, mechanical barriers may need to be installed to prevent unwanted spread of plants. This plant is considered invasive in certain areas of the United States. Check local laws before adding to your landscape. Commonly sold by nurseries in flats for covering large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called bishop's weed or goutweed is one of the most popular ground covers for quickly covering large areas. Will rapidly form a continuous mound of attractive foliage typically growing to 8"" tall with an indefinite spread. Unfortunately, once it gets going, it acts like the proverbial snowball going downhill and can be difficult to contain. Individual leaflets (to 3"" long) are oval and serrated. Tiny white flowers appear in flat-topped, dill-like inflorescences (umbels) which are typical of the parsley/carrot family. Flowers appear above the foliage in May-June, but are not particularly attractive and are often sheared off by gardeners where practicable.Genus name comes from the Greek words aix meaning ""goat"" and podion meaning ""a little foot"", in reference to the leaf shape.The specific epithet podagraria means ""snare of gout"", in reference to its traditional use as a treatment for gout.Common name is in reference to a former use of the plant in the treatment of gout. Also commonly called Bishop's weed in reference to the purported resemblance of the leaflet shape to that of a bishop's miter.'Variegatum' has basal foliage that is light green with creamy white margins. It is less aggressive than the species but plants may revert back to the species with all green leaves and greater vigor. To retain the variegated form, remove any plants that revert.
","
Problems
Leaf blight is a somewhat common disease which is particularly troublesome in hot and humid summer climates. Foliage often declines by mid-summer to the point where mowing on a high setting is needed to revitalize a planting. This plant is an aggressive spreader and is considered invasive in certain areas of the United States. Check local laws before adding to your landscape.
","
Garden Uses
Avoid use of this plant in any mixed planting with other perennials such as in a rock garden or border. Best in a pure, contained planting (surrounded by natural or installed barriers) where it can be allowed to grow and spread solely as a ground cover. Can be quite effective when grown in the shade of trees or large shrubs.

Culture
Easily grown in sandy, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Tolerates brief periods of minor frost (to 28-30 degrees F).  Plants may be grown in pots that are overwintered indoors in a sunny window.  Propagate by seed or rosette cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aeonium undulatum, commonly known as saucer plant, is a succulent evergreen subshrub in the orpine family that typically grows to 2-3’ tall.   It is native to the Canary Islands.   This plant features large rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped, glossy green leaves (each leaf to 4-8” long).  Leaves are often wavy-edged and sometimes have hair-fringed margins.  Small, star-shaped, dark yellow flowers bloom in large terminal pyramidal panicles atop stems rising above the foliage rosettes to 1-2’ tall.  Most plants do not flower every year (some take up to 5 years to flower).  After flowering occurs, the underlying foliage rosette dies, but this is only a significant problem with plants which have only one rosette.Genus name is the Latin name for a plant of this genus of succulents.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word unda meaning wave in reference to the wavy plant leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids, mealybugs, mites or scale may appear.  Root rot may develop in overly moist soils. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Cactus or succulent garden where they can be effectively mixed with aloes, jade plants and/or agave.  Rockeries.  Sunny borders.  Best grown in pots north of USDA Zone 10.

Culture
Best grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Avoid dry soils.  Responds to high heat or drought stress by dropping leaves.  Leaves will remain on the tree longer, perhaps to early fall, if soils are given even and consistent moisture in summer.  This shrub/tree has an early leaf drop and is deciduous for a good part of the year. Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-8. May tolerate Zone 6b(-5°F) if given adequate protection. It prefers a Mediterranean-type climate with wet winters and dry summers and is infrequently grown in the eastern U.S.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus californica, commonly called California buckeye, is a large, deciduous shrub or small tree that is native to the foothills and valleys of the coastal ranges, Tehachapi, and Sierra Nevada Mountains of California in the western United States at elevations below 4,200’ where it is typically found on dry slopes, canyons and along waterways.  It frequently grows in the wild as a spreading shrub to 15’ tall, but will sometimes grow as a small tree to 30’ tall.  It is particularly noted for its (a) open flat-topped crown, short trunk, and spreading branchlets that are reddish to gray-brown when young, (b) smooth silver-gray bark, (c) opposite, lustrous, palmate, shiny dark green leaves, with each leaf having 4-7 but usually 5 narrow-elliptic leaflets (each to 6” long) with fine marginal teeth,  (d) flower panicles (inflorescences to 4-12” long) which contain numerous, fragrant, creamy white to pink 4 to 5-petaled flowers with spidery anthers borne in May-June, (e) pear-shaped to fig-shaped, spineless, rough-textured, thick-husked fruit capsules (to 3” long) which split open in fall at maturity to reveal 1-2  dark brown nuts (each to 1” diameter) commonly known as buckeyes, and (f) sticky winter buds.  

In California, this shrub/tree typically begins new growth in February but usually enters dormancy during the dry summer months.   In the foothills of the Sierra, leaves dry up and are shed in late spring to early summer, typically turning brown and hanging from the tree throughout much of the summer.  In the coastal ranges, leaves typically remain green much later in summer before dropping to the ground as long as soil moisture remains at acceptable levels.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet is in reference California being the native habitat.
","
Problems
For plants in the genus Aesculus, potential disease problems include powdery mildew, rust and anthracnose and potential insect problems include bagworms, Japanese beetle and borers.  Leaf scorch (edges brown up) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to strong wind.  

California buckeye has no serious pest or disease problems.  Early leaf drop typically occurs in areas with dry soils.  All parts of California buckeye are poisonous to humans if ingested.
","
Garden Uses
Single to multi-trunked small tree or large shrub.  Very limited distribution in the United States in large part because of extremely early leaf drop.  Landscape specimen.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus flava, commonly called yellow buckeye, is a medium to large deciduous tree that grows 50-75’ (less frequently to 90’) tall with an oblong-rounded crown. It is the largest of the buckeyes that are native to the U. S. It is typically found in rich soils on river bottoms, stream banks and mountain slopes from southeastern Pennsylvania to northern Alabama and Georgia and down the Ohio River valley to Illinois. Palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with five spreading, toothed, ovate-oblong leaflets to 4-7” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color often includes attractive shades of yellow-orange. Yellow flowers (each 1/2 to 1” long) in erect panicles (to 6” long) appear in mid-spring. Flowers are followed by the familiar buckeye fruit, which is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 buckeyes encased by a leathery light brown partitioned husk. The husk is smooth on the outside, unlike the spiny Ohio buckeye husk. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each buckeye turns red brown with a light eye (hilum). Since colonial times, buckeyes have been carried by many school children and adults as good luck charms even though they are poisonous. Mature trunks (to 2-3’ in diameter) have gray-brown bark that is fissured and scaly. This tree is also noted for having non-sticky buds and non-ridged bud scales. Other common names include big buckeye and sweet buckeye. Synonymous with Aesculus octandra.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means yellow in reference to flower color.
","
Problems
Leaf blotch can be a significant problem. Powdery mildew, leaf spots and anthracnose may also occur. Buckeye lacebug, Japanese beetles, bagworms and borers are infrequent but potentially troublesome. Leaf scorch (brown edges) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to wind. Disease problems for this tree are generally not as severe as those for Ohio buckeye.
","
Garden Uses
Not recommended as a street tree or for use near homes because of the litter produced (particularly twigs, fruit and falling leaves). May be used as an ornamental shade tree. A good selection for more remote areas of the landscape including native plant and moist woodland areas. Michael Dirr considers this tree to be the most beautiful of the large growing Aesculus.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus glabra, commonly called Ohio buckeye, is native from western Pennsylvania to Iowa south to Alabama and Arkansas. It is found throughout the State of Missouri where it typically occurs in rich or rocky wooded areas of valleys, ravines, bluff bases, slopes and thickets (Steyermark). This is a low-branched, small to medium sized deciduous tree that typically grows 20-40’ (less frequently to 75’) tall with a broad oval-rounded crown. Bright green palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with five spreading ovate-oblong leaflets to 3-6” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color is usually yellow, although foliage may develop interesting and attractive shades of orange and red in some years. Greenish-yellow flowers (to 1” long) appear in clusters in mid-spring (late April-May in St. Louis). Flowers are followed by the familiar fruit, which is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 buckeyes encased by a leathery light brown partitioned husk covered with warty spines. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each buckeye turns a handsome shiny dark mahogany brown with a light tan eye. Since colonial times, buckeyes have been carried by many school children and adults as good luck charms. Ohio is known as the Buckeye State and has adopted the buckeye as its State Tree. All parts of this tree, particularly the flowers, bark and twigs, emit an unpleasant odor when bruised, hence the sometimes common name of fetid buckeye.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means smooth without hairs in probably reference to the smooth leaves.Native Americans reportedly called the fruit of this tree “hetuck” meaning eye-of-the-buck in reference to the supposed resemblance of the shiny dark mahogany brown fruit to the eye of a buck deer. The common name of buckeye evolved therefrom.
","
Problems
Leaf blotch can be a significant problem. Powdery mildew and anthracnose are also frequent problems. Watch for bagworms, Japanese beetles and borers. Leaf scorch (brown edges) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to wind.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus hippocastanum, commonly called horsechestnut, is native to the Balkans. It is a medium to large deciduous tree that typically grows 50-75’ tall with an upright oval-rounded crown. Light green palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with 7 (less frequently 5) spreading ovate-oblong leaflets to 4-10” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color usually consists of undistinguished shades of yellow and brown. Showy white flowers with red or yellow markings appear in upright terminal panicles in mid-spring (May in St. Louis). Fruit is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 horsechestnut(s) encased by a leathery light brown husk covered with sharp spines. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each horsechestnut turns a handsome shiny dark mahogany brown with a round light tan scar. Chestnuts and horsechestnuts are in totally different families. Chestnuts (Castanea) are in the beech family (Fagaceae) and produce edible nuts. Horsechestnuts and buckeyes (Aesculus) are in the soapberry family (Sapindaceae) and produce poisonous nuts. Horsechestnut is closely related to Ohio buckeye, being most easily distinguished from the latter by having spiny sharp fruits and sticky buds.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet is the Latin name for horsechestnuts.

","
Garden Uses
A beautiful landscape tree for parks and large lawns. Depreciation of the foliage during the growing season due to disease, insect and scorching problems somewhat limits its value. It has been widely planted in the midwest as a street and shade tree.

Though native to rich woodland areas in Alabama, Georgia and northern Florida, it is winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus parviflora. commonly called bottlebrush buckeye, is noted for being one of the best summer-flowering shrubs for shade areas. It is a dense, mounded, suckering, deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub which typically grows 6-12' tall. Features palmate green leaves (5-7 leaflets) and erect, showy, cylindrical panicles (to 12"" long) of tubular white flowers with conspicuous red anthers and pinkish filaments. Mid-summer bloom can be spectacular. Flowers give way to glossy inedible, pear-shaped nuts (buckeyes) encased in husks, however these nuts are infrequently produced in cultivation in the northern parts of this shrub's growing range (including St. Louis). Foliage turns yellow in autumn. A very large planting of bottlebrush buckeye can be observed on both sides of the sidewalk leading south from the Climatron at the Missouri Botanical Garden.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet means small flowers.

Foliage appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Can be grown from seed, and may flower as early as the second or third year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus pavia, commonly called red buckeye, is a deciduous clump-forming shrub or small tree with an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows 10-20’ tall. Showy, erect, 4-10” long panicles of red to orange-red, narrow-tubular flowers appear in spring. Palmately compound, shiny, dark green leaves are attractive in spring and early summer, but usually begin to decline by August. Smooth, light brown, globular (1-2” diameter) seed capsules encase 1-3 shiny seeds called buckeyes that ripen in the fall. Seeds are poisonous and are avoided by most wildlife. Fall foliage color is unremarkable. Red buckeye is native to southeastern Missouri where it typically occurs in low rich wooded valleys, at bluff bases, on wooded slopes and along streams (Steyermark). Flowers are attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds and bloom in St. Louis at about the same time that the hummingbirds return to the area in spring migration.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet honors 17th century Dutch botanist Peter Paaw (Petrus Pavius).

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-8 (possibly Zone 6 if sited in a protected location) where it is best grown in rich, moist, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade.  Avoid dry soils.  Will naturalize in the landscape by underground runners.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus sylvatica, commonly called painted buckeye or dwarf buckeye, is a fast-growing,  thicket forming, understory deciduous shrub (6-15’) or small tree (to 30’) that is native to the southeastern U.S. where it is typically found in moist, rich woods or along streams from southern Virginia to Georgia west to Tennessee and Alabama.  It is particularly prevalent in Piedmont plateau bottom lands and along the coastal plain. It may be found in the Blue Ridge Mountains in elevations to 3300’.  Palmate-compound leaves are among the first to emerge in spring and among the first to drop in late summer to early fall.  Each leaf has 5 short-stemmed, oblong-obovate leaflets (each leaflet to 4-6” long).  Leaflets are distinguished by having yellow to orange midveins.  Leaves sometimes emerge burgundy-red in early spring before turning to yellow-green above and green beneath.  Bisexual and male flowers (to 1 1/4” long) appear in the same flower cluster (each cluster to 8” long) with the bisexual flowers located near the base.   Flower color is variable.  Flowers are often yellow, cream-colored or pink, but sometimes wholly red or yellow veined with red.  Flowers bloom in showy upright clusters (to 4-6” long) in April-May.  Fruit is a leathery, globular, 3-parted capsule (to 1.5” thick) containing 1 to 3 large, shiny, dark brown seeds commonly known as buckeyes.  Seed ripens in late summer at which point the capsules split open to release them.  Brown scaly bark.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word parts sylv meaning woods or forests and atic meaning habitat.Common name of painted buckeye is in reference to the purported resemblance of the upright flower clusters to a paint brush.
","
Problems
For plants in the genus Aesculus, potential disease problems include powdery mildew, rust and anthracnose and potential insect problems include bagworms, Japanese beetles and borers.  Leaf scorch (edges brown up) may occur in droughty conditions or on sites exposed to strong wind.  

Foliage decline usually occurs throughout summer resulting in loss of leaves in early September.

Culture
Although this evergreen agapanthus may be planted in the ground in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10, it is best grown in tubs or containers in the St. Louis area (Zones 5b-6a) where it is not winter hardy. This is a tender perennial that grows from a fleshy-rooted rhizome. For container plants, plant rhizome 1/2"" below soil surface, keep soils consistently moist and provide moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer). Plants bloom best when roots are pot-bound. Site containers in locations with afternoon shade. In fall prior to the first frost, remove containers to a bright, frost-free location for overwintering. Provide very limited water in winter (just enough to keep leaves from drying/wilting). Return containers outdoors in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agapanthus africanus, commonly called lily-of-the-Nile, is native to South Africa (not the Nile River as the misleading common name suggests). It is an evergreen species that produces rounded clusters (umbels) of blue, funnel-shaped flowers atop stiff, upright, leafless, fleshy stalks (scapes) typically rising 18-24"" tall above a dense mound of basal narrow, strap-shaped, linear, grass-like leaves. Blooms in summer. Foliage mounds are attractive when plants are not in bloom. White cultivars also available.Genus name comes from the Greek words agape meaning love and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means of Africa.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache cana, commonly called hyssop or hummingbird mint, is an herbaceous woody-based perennial of the mint family that features a late spring bloom of tubular, sweetly fragrant, rose-pink to raspberry-pink tubular flowers which bloom in whorls on erect, salvia-like, terminal flowering spikes (to 12” long) rising to 2-3’ tall with a spread to 1.5’.  Pointed, oval leaves (to 1 1/2” long and 1/2”wide) are aromatic.  Double bubblemint is an additional common name for this plant based upon the flowers purportedly having a fragrance similar to that of chewing gum.  This plant is native to mountainous areas to 6000’ in New Mexico and western Texas where it is sometimes commonly called mosquito plant because rubbing the aromatic foliage on one’s skin reportedly repels mosquitoes.  Leaves may be used fresh or dried to flavor teas.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.Specific epithet from Latin means gray-haired or hoary in reference to the gray-green leaves of this plant.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache foeniculum, commonly known as anise hyssop, is an upright, clump-forming perennial of the mint family that is native to parts of the upper Midwest and Great Plains (Wisconsin to Ontario west to British Columbia and south to Colorado). It is typically found in prairies, dry upland forested areas, plains and fields. It grows to 2-4' tall. It is noted for its mid- to late summer bloom of lavender to purple flowers in terminal spikes and its anise-scented foliage. Square stems are clad with ovate to broad-lanceolate dull green leaves (to 4"" long) with toothed margins. Flowers appear in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) which are densely packed into showy, cylindrical, terminal flower spikes (3-6"" long). Gaps sometimes appear along the flower spike. Individual, tiny, tubular, two-lipped flowers (each to 1/3"" long) have no fragrance. Flowers are attractive to bees (good nectar plant), hummingbirds and butterflies. Aromatic leaves can be used to make herbal teas or jellies. Seeds can be added to cookies or muffins. Dried leaves can be added to potpourris.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.Specific epithet comes from a Latin meaning hay.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave americana is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to Mexico.  It has been introduced and has naturalized in a number of tropical areas around the world.  Each plant typically forms a large, evergreen basal rosette of thick, succulent, lanceolate, gray-green leaves.  Each rosette typically matures over time to as much as 6' tall by 8-10' wide.  Each leaf has a waxy bloom, spiny tip, and sharp marginal spines.  This plant is also well-known for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Plants are monocarpic (bloom only once and then die).  Common name of century plant suggests the plant will live 100 years before flowering.  In reality, outdoor plants typically bloom between the 10th and 25th years.   Indoor plants rarely flower.  When an outdoor plant blooms, it sends up a single, stout, erect flowering stalk from the center of the basal rosette of leaves to 15-30' tall or more.  The flowering stalk resembles a narrow telephone pole with horizontal branching near the top.  Greenish-yellow flowers (each to 3-4"" long) bloom in panicles at the branch ends.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of each rosette over time, often forming a colony of new plants.  Once a plant flowers and dies, the offsets around the base of the plant continue to grow.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet means of America.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this agave serves as an interesting tropical accent or specimen.   It is a large and showy plant for the landscape.  It needs a large space in which to grow.  Plants are often grown in cactus or succulent garden areas.  It will grow well in containers as an indoor plant at a much smaller size.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it grows best in a sandy/gritty, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates poor soils. Also tolerates dry soils and drought, but appreciates regular watering. Plant leaves will shrivel in dry conditions, but will revive when given moisture. Intolerant of frosts particularly when temperatures dip below 28 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave attenuata, commonly called century plant, is a rosette forming perennial succulent that is native to the plateaus/mountains of central Mexico. It is perhaps most noted for its attractive leaves and its huge drooping flower stems. Spineless, fleshy, ovate, light gray to pale yellowish-green evergreen leaves (to 28” long) form a large symmetrical rosette. Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes. With age, a stem/trunk to 3’ long may develop, with the trunk becoming visible as the older leaves of the rosette fall off. Each rosette will flower only once, usually when the plant reaches about 10 years old. The “flower” is a huge recurving raceme to 5-10’ tall with small, drooping, densely-packed, yellow-green to white flowers. Flowers are followed by seed pods. The rosette dies after flowering, but suckers/offsets at the base remain as new plants. Additional common names for this plant include lion’s tail, swan’s neck and foxtail. Plants may be grown outdoors in parts of California, southern Texas and southern Florida.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet refer to the gradual reduction of the leaf as it tapers to a slender point.

Culture
Reliably winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10.  Best growth occurs in a sandy/gritty, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade.  Sharp soil drainage is important.  Poorly-drained soils inevitably lead to root rot.  Tolerates dry soils and drought.   Surprisingly good winter hardiness for this succulent.  Plants have reportedly survived winters with temperatures as low as -20F (USDA Zone 5), but cold temperatures should be ""dry cold"" as opposed to ""wet cold"".
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave parryi, often called Parry's agave or mescal, is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to grasslands, chaparral, desert scrub, pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands in Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico typically at elevations from 4,000 to 8,000 feet.  It is most noted for its attractive blue-gray to gray-green evergreen leaves, but is also noted for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Thick, rigid, smooth, ovate to oblong, blue-gray leaves (to 12” long) form a large, dense, symmetrical, basal rosette.  A rosette will typically mature over time to 2' tall by 3' wide.  Each leaf has spiny margins with a one inch terminal spine.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes.  Each rosette will flower only once, usually at some point between 10-15 years (not the 100 years suggested by the also-used common name of century plant used for some agaves), but sometimes flowering will not occur until 20-30 years.  One huge flowering stalk (to 20' tall) will rise from each rosette, with each stalk producing 20 to 30 side branches and with each side branch containing a large cluster of creamy yellow flowers.  In its native habitat, flowers typically bloom in summer (June - August).  Flowers are followed by seed pods.  The flowering rosette dies after flowering, but new rosettes formed by suckers/offsets from the base of the mother plant will remain.  Native Americans used this agave as a source of food, fiber, soap and medicine. Plant liquids may be fermented to form an alcoholic beverage called pulque which may be further distilled to form mescal or tequila.  

Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable in probable reference to the flower spikes.  

Specific epithet honors Charles C. Parry (1823-1890), physician-botanist-plant collector.
","
Problems
Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this agave serves as an interesting tropical accent or specimen.  Mass plantings can be spectacular. Borders.  Ground cover.  Container plant for areas where it is not winter hardy.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave univittata, known as McKelvey's century plant or thorn-crested agave, is a perennial, rosette-forming succulent native to extreme southern Texas and northern Mexico. It is found at relatively low elevations (less than 300 ft.) in areas around the Gulf Coast and Rio Grande. Rosettes typically reach 1-2' tall and 1.5-3' wide. Dark green, slightly convex leaves (to 15"" long) sport a sharp, terminal spine and sharp, curved, marginal spines.  Once an individual plant reaches maturity, it will send up an unbranching flowering stalk up to 15' tall. The flowers are around 1.5"" in length, with pale green to pale yellow coloration. This agave suckers readily, and can form large colonies over time.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet univittata means ""one stripe"", and refers to the single, light green stripe which can run lengthwise down the center of the leaves on some individuals.The common name McKelvey's agave refers to Susan Delano McKelvey (1883-1964). A botanist at the Arnold Arboretum, she specialized in lilacs and the flora of the southwestern United States.'Splendida' forms smaller rosettes compared to the species plant, growing to a maximum of around 12"" tall and 18"" wide at maturity. The succulent leaves are dark green with a greenish-yellow stripe down the center. The leaves reach 7"" long and 2"" wide, and are armed with sharp marginal and terminal spines. Mature rosettes will send up a 12' tall flower stalk bearing greenish-yellow flowers that attract hummingbirds.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs and snails may damage foliage. Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Due to the sharp spines and suckering nature of this agave, do not plant near sidewalks, walkway, driveways, or other pedestrian areas. Use in a rock garden, desert garden, or as an accent plant in a container.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers part shade in moist, humusy soils. Does reasonably well in dryish soils however. These plants have decidedly better shade tolerance than most other species of Eupatorium. Deadhead spent flower heads to avoid any unwanted self-seeding. Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ageratina altissima commonly called white snakeroot, is native to woodland areas in the Eastern United States. It is common throughout Missouri where it typically occurs in rich or rocky woods, thickets, wood margins and rocky areas (Steyermark). It features small fluffy bright white flowers (composites with rays absent) arranged in loose, flattened clusters (corymbs to 3-4” across) atop smooth stems typically rising 3-5’ tall. Blooms from late summer to frost. This is a somewhat weedy perennial that can spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding. Long-stalked, sharp-toothed, taper-pointed, lance-shaped to elliptic-oval, nettle-like, dark green leaves (3-6” long) are paired along the stems. Native Americans reportedly used a decoction of the roots as a remedy for snakebite, hence the common name. Settlers who drank milk from cows that fed on this plant often developed the disease called milk sickness. This plant is synonymous with Eupatorium rugosum.Specific epithet means tall or highest.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf miners and flea beetles may attack the foliage. Self-seeding and rhizomatous can spread rapidly in optimum growing conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, wild gardens, woodland gardens and naturalized areas. May be effective in shady corners of the border.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers rich soils with good drainage and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Plants tend to wilt quickly if soils are allowed to dry out. Tolerates light shade, and prefers some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. In climates where powdery mildew is a problem, avoid overhead watering and site in areas with good air circulation. Ageratums are easily grown from seed. Seed may be started indoors in late winter and transplanted outdoors after threat of frost has passed. Seed may also be sown directly in the garden after last frost date, however flowering season will be shorter (late summer to frost). Seeds are tiny and difficult to work with, particularly for direct outdoor plantings. For gardeners who do not wish to use seed, live plants are available from many nurseries in cell packs/six packs and flats. Space taller varieties 12” apart and shorter varieties 6” apart. Spent flowers will fall to the ground as they fade to be replaced by new bloom throughout the growing season. Prompt deadheading of the faded flowers is not necessary, but keeps a planting tidy and tends to promote a better uninterrupted bloom. Plants may not bloom to frost in some hot summer climates, but usually do so in cooler ones. First autumn frost will kill most if not all plants, at which point they may be removed from the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ageratum houstonianum, commonly called floss flower, is a frost-tender annual of the aster family that provides continuous bloom for beds, gardens or containers from late spring to frost. Features fluffy flowers (basically asters with ray flowers absent) in flattened to slightly rounded clusters atop compact, mounded plants generally ranging from 4” to 18” tall. Some taller varieties (e.g., the triploid ‘Blue Horizon’) are more erect and grow to as much as 30” tall. Species flowers are medium blue, however many cultivars are available in commerce in various shades of blue, pink, red, white and bicolor. Leaves are typically rounded, cordate-at-the-base, hairy, slightly quilted and soft green. Taller varieties make good cut flowers.Genus name presumably comes from the Greek a meaning not and geras meaning old age  because the flowers hold their color for a long time.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids and whiteflies. Powdery mildew is an occasional problem, particularly in hot and humid climates where soils are kept on the dry side and air circulation is poor. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Taller plants usually benefit from some support.
","
Garden Uses
Shorter varieties are excellent as bedding plants, edgers (along paths, walkways and border fronts) and container plants (hanging baskets, window boxes, urns or other containers). Also effective in rock gardens. Taller varieties are appropriate for mid-borders or cutting gardens.

This indoor plant tolerates atmospheric dryness and somewhat shady locations. Normal room temperature with recommended 60 degrees F. minimum winter temperature.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aglaonema commutatum, commonly called Chinese evergreen, is an evergreen perennial that generally resembles dieffenbachia (dumb cane) in appearance. It typically grows to 20” tall. Thick, elliptic to lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 4-8” long and 2-3” wide) with attractive silver-gray blotches on erect, sometimes branched stems. As a houseplant, it rarely flowers. Each axillary flower (typical arum family) features a small creamy white spadix enclosed by a pale green spathe, usually in late summer to early fall. Clusters of red berries follow the flowers.Genus name comes from the Greek words aglaos meaning bright or clear and nema meaning a thread in reference to the stamens.Specific epithet means changing in form.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids, mealybugs, spider mites or scale. Rots may occur if plants are over-watered. Leaves may brown up if plants are grown in very dry air or placed in a drafty location. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor ones. Tolerates close to full shade. Quite tolerant of urban pollution. This is a suckering plant that can form large colonies or thickets that tend to choke out native plants. Spreads invasively by aggressive root suckering and self-seeding. Most homeowners are more interested in eradicating this plant than in growing it ornamentally.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ailanthus altissima, commonly called tree of heaven, is native to China and was introduced into New York City in 1820 as a street tree and food source for silkworm caterpillars. It has now naturalized throughout much of the United States. In many areas it has become a noxious weed. It is extremely fast-growing and it will grow almost anywhere. It can literally grow up from a crack in the sidewalk, and is strong enough to push up through the blacktop surface of a parking lot. It not only grows in cities, but may also be found in the country along roads, fencerows, clearings and wood margins. It can grow up to 60-80’ tall with a loose, open, sometimes graceful form, but is usually seen growing much shorter in urban areas. Wood is weak and tall trees in exposed areas may easily top out in strong winds. Odd-pinnate compound leaves (most often 11-25 leaflets each) tend to give it a certain tropical appearance. Leaflets have large gland-tipped teeth at the base. These teeth distinguish it from the sumacs, which also have long compound leaves. Mostly dioecious (separate male and female trees), but some perfect flowers exist. Male flowers have an unpleasant odor. Actually all parts of the tree have an unpleasant odor. Blooms early summer (June-July). Flowers are greenish. Female flowers produce seeds (twisted samaras) in clusters ripening to reddish-brown in September. Smooth pale gray bark. This is the tree featured in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith (1942), a coming of age novel about a young girl growing up in a Brooklyn tenement who finds the toughness and persistence of Ailanthus, growing up from the sidewalk cracks, to be an aspirational metaphor for overcoming the adversities of her own life.Genus name is the Latinized version of the native Moluccan name ailanto meaning sky tree for a species of this genus.Specific epithet is a superlative form of the Latin word meaning high, hence the common name of tree of heaven.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Invasive and difficult to eradicate. Weak wooded. Short-lived. Messy.
","
Garden Uses
This is not a good landscape tree, however if it is to be grown, female trees are generally preferable to male trees. It will grow and prosper in areas of poor soils where few other trees will flourish.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils with good drainage, but tolerates moderately dry ones. Will grow in full shade, but best foliage color usually occurs in part-sun locations (at least 3-4 hours of sun per day). Provide good air circulation in hot and humid areas where crown rot is a problem. Divide plants if they become overcrowded. This low-growing bugleweed will spread in the garden by stolons (reptans means creeping) to form an attractive, mat-like ground cover. Plants may be cut back to the ground after flowering, if necessary, to rejuvenate the foliage. Large plantings may be mowed on a high mower setting to remove spent flower spikes and to tidy the appearance of the planting. Space plants 6-9” apart for prompt cover. On variegated forms promptly remove any non-variegated leaves that may appear.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ajuga reptans, commonly called bugleweed, is a dense, rapidly spreading, mat-forming ground cover which features shiny, dark green leaves. Whorls of tiny, blue-violet flowers appear in mid to late spring on spikes rising above the foliage to 10"". Cultivars of this species feature leaves with more interesting and varied foliage color. When in full flower, large clumps of bugleweed can produce a striking display. Dense foliage will choke out weeds. Not particularly tolerant of foot traffic.Genus name origin is unclear.Specific epithet means creeping.
","
Problems
Crown rot can be a problem, particularly in the humid conditions of the deep South and in heavy soils. Avoid planting in wet, heavy soils, provide good air circulation and divide when clumps become overcrowded. Also avoid planting near perennial beds or lawns where its spreading nature could pose removal problems.
","
Garden Uses
Primary use is as a ground cover. Will fill in large, shady areas where lawns are difficult to establish. May also be planted on banks or slopes, under trees or around shrubs. Can be planted over spring bulbs such as snowdrops (Galanthus). Avoid planting adjacent to lawn areas since little islands of ajuga may start appearing in the grass. Good for small spaces, containers and rock gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in most soils. Best in well-drained sandy loams with regular moisture in full sun to part shade. Prefers full sun, but tolerates close to full shade. Also tolerates some drought. Needs a support structure upon which to grow unless grown as a ground cover. For best fruit production, plant more than one vine to facilitate good cross-pollination. Many experts recommend hand-pollination. Prune as needed in late spring after flowers appear. May be cut to the ground to renovate. Foliage is semi-evergreen in warm winter climates. Grows rapidly and can suffocate shrubs or other vegetation if not kept in check.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Akebia quinata, commonly called fiveleaf akebia, is a deciduous, twining, woody vine that rapidly grows to 20-40’. It produces compound palmate leaves, each with 5 elliptic to oblong-obovate leaflets (1-3” long) which are dark green above and glaucous below. Small chocolate-purple flowers bloom in drooping axillary racemes in spring. Flowers are monoecious, with both staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers appearing in the same raceme. Flowers are often hidden by the foliage, but are quite interesting on close inspection and have a pleasant fragrance. Flowers give way to sausage-shaped, violet fruit pods (to 4” long) which split open in fall to reveal small black seeds imbedded in a whitish pulp. The whitish pulp is edible. Native to China, Korea and Japan, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized in parts of the eastern U.S. Sometimes commonly called chocolate vine.Genus name is the Latinized version of the Japanese name akebi for these twining shrubs.Specific epithet means having five parts, in reference to the five-leaflet palmate leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rampant growth can be a problem.
","
Garden Uses
Provides quick cover in sun or shade for trellises, fences, arbors, pergolas and walls. May also be sprawled over the ground as a ground cover to camouflage rock piles or old tree stumps or to provide soil stabilization for banks. An excellent ground cover for shady areas and woodland gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Best flowering occurs in full sun.  Prefers rich, light soils.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, however, including poor ones.  Tolerates alkaline conditions.  Tolerates drought, but best growth occurs with regular watering.  Thrives in high summer heat.  Not reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Albizia julibrissin, commonly called mimosa or silk tree, is a fast-growing, small to medium sized, deciduous tree that typically grows in a vase shape to 20-40’ tall with a spreading, often umbrella-like crown.  It is native to Asia (Iran to Japan).  It has been widely planted in the U. S. as an ornamental and has escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the southeastern U. S. and California.  In the wild, it is typically seen growing in vacant lots, waste areas, clearings, wood margins, fields and along roads.  It can be quite invasive in watersheds where water currents carry and distribute the seeds downstream.  It is noted for its bipinnate compound dark green leaves (to 20” long).  Each leaf has 10-25 pinnae, with each pinnae having 40-60 tiny leaflets (to 1/4” long).  Leaves have a fern-like appearance.  Fluffy, pink, powder puff flowerheads cover the tree with a long summer bloom.  Flowers are fragrant and attractive to bees.  Flowers give way to flat bean-like seed pods (to 7” long) which persist into winter.  Sensitive leaflets close up when touched and at night.  Leaflets fall to the ground after frost, producing no fall color.Genus name honors Filippo degli Albizzia, 18th century Italian naturalist, who introduced the genus to Italy in 1749.Specific epithet comes from the Persian word gul-ebruschin meaning floss silk in reference to the flowers.
","
Problems
Wilt is becoming a serious problem in many areas. Also susceptible to mimosa web worm.  Self-seeding can produce numerous seedlings.  Falling leaves, flowers and seed pods can pose significant clean-up problems if trees are planted near homes.  Weak wooded limbs are susceptible to damage from strong winds and ice/snow.
","
Garden Uses
Generally considered to be an attractive but inferior landscape tree.  May be used as a lawn accent in areas where soils are poor or alkaline.  Avoid planting in areas where wilt is a problem.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and some light shade, but will not tolerate wet winter soils. Considered a biennial or short-lived perennial. If grown from seed, plant seeds in August or September for bloom the following year. Although short-lived, hollyhocks easily self-seed and can establish colonies in the garden that persist for years as if they were perennials.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alcea rosea, commonly called hollyhocks, are old garden favorites. The flowers grow on rigid, towering spikes or spires which typically reach a height of 5-8' tall and usually do not require staking. Foliage features large, heart-shaped (3, 5 or 7 lobes), rough lower leaves which become progressively smaller toward the top of the spire. Long bloom period of June to August. Sometimes listed in nursery catalogs under Althaea.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek word alkaia for a kind of mallow.Specific epithet means pink.
","
Problems
Foliage is susceptible to rust, leaf spot and anthracnose. Spider mites and Japanese beetle can also be problems. Foliage can become rather tattered and unkempt in appearance when attacked by the aforementioned insects and/or diseases, but the flowers generally are not affected. May need staking, particularly if not protected from wind.
","
Garden Uses
Hollyhocks provide excellent architectural height, contrast and a certain amount of old world charm to cottage gardens and border backgrounds. Also effective when grown against walls or fences.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade, but tolerates close to full shade.  Prefers part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Performs well in moist garden areas. Freely self-seeds in the garden to the point of being somewhat invasive in optimum growing conditions.  Prompt removal of spent flower stems will not only prevent self-seeding but may also encourage a sparse, late summer rebloom.  Plants may be grown from seed started indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  Divide plants as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alchemilla mollis, commonly known as lady’s mantle, is a clumping perennial which typically forms a basal foliage mound (6-12” tall ) of long-stalked, circular, scallop-edged, toothed, pleated, soft-hairy, light green leaves (to 6” across) each with 9-11 shallow rounded lobes.  It is primarily native to mountain areas in eastern Europe (Carpathians, Caucusus and Turkey).  Tiny, apetalous, star-shaped, chartreuse flowers appear in loose, spreading clusters (compound cymes) atop stems rising above the foliage to 12-18” in late spring to early summer.  The tendency of plant leaves to retain moisture beads after a rain is considered to be a unique and attractive ornamental feature.Origin uncertain, perhaps the Latinized version of an Arabic name.Specific epithet means soft.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be an aggressive self-seeder. In hot summer climates such as St. Louis, leaves may scorch in full sun exposures or if soils are permitted to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Border fronts.  Cottage gardens.  Edging for paths.  Mass as ground cover.  Flowers may be cut at the peak of bloom and hung up to dry in a dark room for future use in dried flower arrangements.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aleurites moluccanus, commonly known as Kukui or candlenut tree, is a tropical broadleaf evergreen tree in the spurge family that is noted for producing attractive flowers, walnut-sized fruits and maple-like, pale green, evergreen leaves.  It typically grows to 20-50’ tall, but less frequently to as much as 90’ tall.  It is native from Indonesia and Malaysia into the western parts of Polynesia (exact native range is unclear), but very early spread and naturalized throughout Southeast Asia and the islands in the South Pacific.  Polynesian settlers reportedly brought this tree to Hawaii where it has naturalized in open forests, lower alpine slopes, river margins, hillsides and ridges.  Although not native to Hawaii, Kukui was designated the Hawaiian State tree in 1959.  The flower has been designated as the island flower of Molokai.  Historically, Hawaiians once strung candlenuts on a palm leaf tendril and burned them one at a time for light.  They also extracted oil from the nuts for use as a fuel in stone oil lamps called Kukui hele po.  Kukui means light, hence its use as a common name.  

Spreading to downward-arching branches and twigs of this tree are clad with glossy, heart-shaped, triangular to oblong, pale green leaves (to 4-8” long) with toothed margins.  Leaves often have 3-5 shallow lobes.  Young leaves, young branches and inflorescences are stellate hairy.  From a distance, this tree appears to have a white flour-like dusting.  

Small-but-showy, 5-petaled, creamy white flowers bloom in dense panicled cymes (to 4-9” long) at the branch ends.  Flowers are monoecious.  Flowers typically bloom April to October, but may bloom irregularly throughout the year with flowers and fruits often being present on the tree at the same time in various stages of development.  Female flowers are followed by thick-rinded, walnut-sized fruits (to 2” diameter), each containing 1-2 large, nut-like seeds (candlenuts) which have a high oil content.  Nuts are pressed for oil which is not only used in candles/lamps, but is also used in making additional products such as soaps and varnishes.Genus name comes from the Greek word aleuron meaning floury in reference to the white flour-like dusting present on juvenile leaves.Specific epithet means from the Moluccas (aka Spice Islands) located in eastern Indonesia which is part of the native habitat for this tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to dieback and canker.  All parts of this tree are toxic to humans if ingested, and in particular the seeds.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this evergreen tree has excellent ornamental features.  Good landscape specimen or shade tree.

Easily grown in wet soils in full sun. Needs full sun for best flowering. Plant tuber-like corms in boggy soils, on wet pond or stream margins or in shallow water (2-6”). Plant corms in containers for use in water gardens. Freely self-seeds in optimum growing conditions, sometimes to the point of being very aggressive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alisma triviale, commonly called water plantain, is a rhizomatous, Missouri native, marginal aquatic perennial that typically occurs along the muddy margins of or emersed in shallow water near the edges of ponds, streams, sloughs, marshes and ditches. Plants growing in water typically exhibit lax, often narrow, foliage whereas plants growing on muddy margins exhibit erect foliage. Whorls of tiny white flowers (1/4” diameter) appear in summer in large, branched panicles atop flowering stems growing well above the foliage to 2-3’ tall. Flowering stems rise from the centers of basal rosettes of long-stalked, broad ovate to lance-shaped, gray-green leaves (blades typically to 6-8” long). 

Synonymous with Alsima plantago-aquatica var. americanum.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name for this plant.Specific epithet means common or ordinary.Common name is in reference to the similarity of the leaves to those of the unrelated true plantains (genus Plantago).

Culture
Tropical evergreen vine or shrub that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Best flowering in full sun. Best performance occurs in hot and humid climates where nighttime temperatures do not dip below 60 degrees F. In St. Louis, this plant is grown as an annual or in containers or greenhouses. Container plants must be brought inside before first frost and overwintered as houseplants in large sunny rooms with intense bright light and moderate humidity or in a greenhouse. When grown as a vine, it must be trained to grow on a support structure because it does not twine or have tendrils/aerial roots. May also be pruned to grow as a shrub. Thin stems to promote air circulation if fungal diseases attack the foliage. Can be difficult to grow as a houseplant due to large size.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Native to Brazil, golden trumpet or common allamanda is a frost-tender, evergreen, tropical plant that is primarily grown as a climbing vine, but may also be pruned as a shrub. As a vine, it will grow rapidly to 20’. Features clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped, single or double flowers with white throat markings and leathery, wavy-margined, obovate, light green leaves (4-6” long) that appear in whorls of 3-4 or in pairs along the stems. Blooms throughout the summer to first frost. As with most dogbane family members, the stems exude a toxic milky sap.Genus name is in honor of Swiss botanist Frederik Allamand (b. about 1735, d. after 1776).Specific epithet means purgative.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Allamanda schottii, commonly called bush allamanda is an evergreen tropical shrub native to Brazil. It typically grows to 4-5’ tall. Features clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers with orange-red throat stripes and leathery, elliptic to obovate, dull green leaves (2-4” long) that appear in whorls of 3-5 along the stems. If spent flowers are not deadheaded, rounded, prickly, burlike fruits will form providing some additional ornamental interest, albeit at the expense of a more profuse bloom. Freely blooms throughout the summer to first frost. This species is synonymous with and sometimes listed for sale as A. nerifolia or A. cathartica var. schottii. It is generally more shrub-like than A. cathartica. As with most dogbane family members, the stems exude a toxic milky sap.Genus name is in honor of Swiss botanist Frederik Allamand (b. about 1735, d. after 1776).Specific epithet may honor Richard van der Schot (c.1730-1819).

Culture
Easily grown in deep, organically rich, medium moisture, sandy, well-drained loams in full sun.  Plants perform best with consistent moisture during the growing season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium ampeloprasum, commonly known as wild leek, is in a large genus of about 400 species of variable plants in the onion family. This species is native to Southern Europe, northern Africa, western Asia and Egypt, but has been introduced and in many cases naturalized in a large number of additional areas throughout the world.  This species consists of biennial, onion-like plants now divided into three different horticultural/vegetable groups, namely (1) Porrum Group (leeks grown for their tasty stems), (2) Ampeloprasum Group (elephant garlic and levant garlic grown for their mild garlic-like bulbs) and (3) Kurrat Group (kurrat).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word ampelos meaning vine and parson meaning leek for a leek found growing in vineyards.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Slugs attack young plants.  Rust may be the most serious disease affecting leeks (remove and destroy infected plants). Watch for mildew and leaf spot.  Onion maggots and thrips may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Vegetable commonly added to casseroles, salads, stir fry, soups and stew, but may be eaten raw.

Culture
Plant as sets (bulblets) in early spring as soon as ground can be worked, about 6"" apart in rows 8"" apart with ½ to 1"" covering of soil. Give room to grow as each bulblet will become a whole clump. They prefer well-drained, sandy and limey soil. Any organic material should be well composted. Provide regular shallow cultivation to reduce weed competition. Harvest tops or entire plant at anytime. Pull as green onions when 8"" tall. Top harvesting will delay bulb crop maturity. Harvest bulbs when tops die back: pull soil away from clump to expose to full sun, pull up in several days, let dry outside for several days before moving to screens or racks in dark dry environment.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium cepa, commonly called shallots, are considered essential in French cooking, with a flavor somewhere between onions and garlic. Use greens as you would use green onions or chives. Use bulbs for soups, salad dressing, vegetable dishes, and casseroles. The onion is a cultivated vegetable of great antiquity and is not known as a wild plant. Greeks and Romans believed shallots originated in Palestine.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet is Latin for onion.
","
Problems
Onion yellows is a viral disease that attacks all members of the onion family, especially non-seed types vegetatively propagated by bulblets. The virus stunts the plants, deforms foliage, and over winters in bulbs and bulblets. Using infected bulbs and bulblets spreads the virus through insect vectors to other onions in the vicinity. Select planting stock from reputable sources to insure they are virus free. Do not plant bulbs or bulblets that may have a problem.
","
Garden Uses
Fresh like green onions or in cooking.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun to light shade. Best in full sun, but appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Best in sandy loams. Plants will naturalize by self-seeding and bulb offsets in optimum growing conditions. Deadhead flowers before seed sets to help control any unwanted spread. Foliage persists past flowering into late summer before dying back. Plants are easily grown from seed which should be planted in spring or from bulbs/bulb offsets which should be planted in autumn.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium cernuum, commonly called nodding wild onion, is a Missouri native plant which occurs primarily in rocky soils on glades, bluff edges, open woods and slopes in the Ozark region of the State. Plants typically grow 12-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12” tall) and tiny bell-shaped, pink to lilac pink (occasionally white) flowers which appear in loose, nodding clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Wild nodding onion is distinguished from most other native alliums by the fact that its scapes crook sharply downward at the top just below the flower so that the flower umbel nods (hence the common name). Blooms in summer. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, nodding onion is not generally considered to be of culinary value today.

Specific epithet means nodding.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means nodding.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage dies back in late summer.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 6-9 where this plant is easily grown in rich, deep, medium moisture, well-drained, sandy-limey loams in full sun to part shade.  Plants tolerate a variety of soil types.  Best performance occurs with consistent moisture during the growing season.  Perennial plants are easy to propagate by division.  This perennial bunching onion can be harvested year round in mild winter climates.  It infrequently self-seeds, but clumps will spread slowly in the garden.  In cold winter climates north of Zone 6, this plant is typically grown as an annual.  When grown as an annual, sow seeds in early spring for summer use.  Plant 1/4” and 1/2” apart and 1/2” deep.  Provide regular shallow cultivation to reduce weed competition.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium fistulosum, commonly called spring onion, Welsh onion, or Japanese bunching onion, is a clumping, slowly-spreading, evergreen perennial onion that is primarily grown as a vegetable for harvest of its tasty onion-flavored leaves.  Elongated underground bulbs are barely thicker than the plant stem (some characterize this species as being “bulbless”).  Hollow, leafless, blue-green flowering stalks rise to 24-36” tall, each stalk being topped by a globular terminal umbel (to 3” diameter) containing tiny, yellowish-white, 6-tepaled flowers.  Each umbel typically sports 50-100 flowers which bloom from late May to August.  Hollow, basal green leaves are linear with entire margins, parallel venations and glabrous surfaces.  

This bunching onion was developed in Asia from a wild relative native to China.  It was brought to Europe in the 17th century.  The original Chinese plant may be extinct in the wild.  This onion has been extensively cultivated since ancient times.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in Alaska and in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word fistulosus meaning hollow in reference to the stems and leaves.Common name of Welsh onion does not refer to the country of Wales, but is derived from the German word walsch meaning foreign.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Slugs attack young plants.  Mildew, rust and leaf spots may appear.  Watch for onion maggots and thrips.
","
Garden Uses
Widely used as a food additive in salads, garnishes, soups, stews, stir fry and Chinese cooking.  Also serves as a chive/leek substitute.  May be grown in herb gardens and vegetable gardens where the young leaves and bulbils may be harvested for food.  Leaves are tasty when young, but are not ornamentally attractive.  Flowering stalks are ornamentally attractive when flowers are in bloom.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  In the St. Louis area, bulblets (cloves) are best planted in fall but need the protection of a good winter mulch (e.g., straw).  In very cold winters, the bulblets may not survive.  Bulblets may also be planted in early spring.  Fall plantings generally produce larger bulbs for harvest.  Plant bulblets 2” deep and 6"" apart with the pointed end up in rows 1-2' apart.   Harvest in late summer after most of the leaves have turned yellow-brown and begin to fall over.  Dry bulbs for several days before storing in a cool, dry location.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium sativum, commonly called garlic, is a bulbous perennial of the onion family.  It is native to the Mediterranean area.  Foliage consists of aromatic, linear, flattened, grass-like green leaves.  In some varieties, a central scape topped by an umbel of pinkish-white flowers rises from each clump of leaves to 18” tall in summer.  Garlic is typically grown as an annual in herb and vegetable gardens for its segmented bulbs which are commonly used in cooking.  

Garlic comes in two varieties:  hardneck (designated as Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon) and softneck (designated as Allium sativum var. sativum).  Hardneck varieties typically produce a flower stalk, with flowers giving way to a seed cap.  Each bulb typically contains 4-10 cloves (bulb is smaller but cloves are larger than those of softneck).   Hardneck varieties come in three different types:  Rocambole, Poreclain and Purple Stripe.  By contrast, softneck garlic plants typically do not produce a flower stalk.  They produce bulbs with smaller but more numerous cloves than hardneck garlic plants.  Each bulb typically contains 12-20 cloves.  Softneck plants are also braidable (bulbs can be braided together into attractive chains by weaving the soft grass-like tops together).  Softneck garlic varieties are the ones most often commonly sold in supermarkets because they typically have a much longer shelf life than hardnecks.   Softneck varieties come in two different types:  Silverskin and Artichoke.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means cultivated.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Root/bulb rot may occur in wet, poorly-drained soils.   Potential insect pests include nematodes, thrips, bulb mites, onion maggots and wireworms.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium sphaerocephalon, commonly called round-headed leak or drumstick allium, is a bulbous perennial that is ornamentally grown for its early summer bloom of rose-purple to pink flower heads. This plant is native throughout Europe to the Caucusus, Iran and northern Africa. Cylindrical, hollow, grassy, gray-green leaves to 14"" long form a foliage clump in spring. In late spring, sturdy slender flowering stems rise to 24-36"" tall topped with egg-shaped flower heads (umbels to 1"" wide) in an impressive early summer bloom (June-July in St. Louis). Each flower head is a tight, dense, clover-like cluster of tiny florets that emerge deep green but mature (top to bottom) to rose-purple. Each flower head displays an interesting bi-color effect as the florets change from green to purple. This species blooms later than most of the alliums. Flower heads resemble the flower heads of some clovers. Flowers lack fragrance. Bulbils sometimes form after flowering. Leaves and bulbs have an onion-like aroma when cut or bruised. Synonymous with and formerly known as Allium sphaerocephalum.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means with a round head.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils. Mildew, rust, leaf spots and thrips may appear. Plants may colonize over time, but are not considered to be invasive.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental onion for rock gardens, beds and borders, cottage gardens, open woodland areas and meadows. Best grown in large groups or massed. May be naturalized. Grows well in containers. Cut flowers are excellent for both fresh cut and dried flower arrangements.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium stellatum, commonly called prairie onion, is a Missouri native plant that occurs primarily in rocky soils on limestone glades and bluff ledges in the Ozark region of the State (Steyermark). It is also found on rocky prairies in parts of the Midwest and Great Plains where it is also sometimes commonly called prairie onion. It is a bulbous perennial which typically grows 12-18"" tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12"" tall) and tiny, starry, bell-shaped, reddish-pink flowers which appear in rounded clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Blooms in mid to late summer. Leaves often die back by the time of flowering. Leaves and flower scapes rise directly from the bulbs. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, this species of allium is not generally considered to be of culinary value today. Bulbs were also used by early Americans as cough/cold remedies and as insect repellants. Nodding wild onion (Allium cernuum) is similar to this plant in size, culture and general appearance, except, as the common name suggests, the flower umbel nods rather than stands erect.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means star-like in reference to the flower shape.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage dies back in late summer.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Spreads somewhat aggressively by self-seeding and tuberous rootstocks. Deadhead flowers before seed set to control unwanted spread.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium tuberosum, commonly called garlic chives, is a clump-forming onion family member which may be grown for both culinary and ornamental purposes. Features chive-like, gray-green leaves up to 12"" long which may be used in cooking in the same manner as chives (Allium schoenoprasum). Tiny, star-shaped, white flowers with brown striped tepals appear in loose clusters (umbels to 2"" wide) atop leafless 9-18"" stems in late summer into fall. Plants will colonize, and a small planting can expand rather quickly. All parts of the plant have an oniony smell when cut or crushed, however the flower scent is more suggestive of violets. Also commonly called Chinese chives because the plant is grown extensively in China for culinary purposes.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means tuberous.
","
Problems
No serious pest or disease problems. Can become a weed.
","
Garden Uses
Herb gardens, vegetable gardens, cottage gardens or naturalized areas. Attractive flowers have good ornamental value and are pleasant additions to rock gardens or border fronts, however flowers must be deadheaded before setting seed or seedlings will sprout up throughout the garden.

Culture
Easily grown in rich, moist but well-drained loams in full sun to part shade.  This is a woodland plant that is more tolerant of part shade conditions than most members of the genus.  Add sand to clay soils as needed to improve drainage.  This species spreads invasively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and over time can carpet large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium ursinum, commonly called wild garlic or ramsons, is a bulbous perennial that is native to damp shaded woods in Europe and northern Asia.  It produces small rounded bulbs on branched rhizomes.  Each year, leaves appear in late winter, flowers bloom in spring, and seeds mature by mid-summer at which point the plants die back and go dormant until the following late winter.  Each plant bears 2-3 distinctive, elliptic, linear, deep green basal leaves somewhat reminiscent of the leaves of lily-of-the-valley. If bruised or crushed, the foliage emits a strong onion/garlic-like aroma.  Flattened, 2-inch diameter, loose umbels of star-shaped white flowers bloom in spring atop leafless stems rising to 6-12"" (less frequently to 18"") tall.  Each umbel bears 15-20 flowers.  Leaves and flowers may be eaten raw (salads) or cooked (addition to soups, sauces or stews).  Leaf flavor begins to decline as the flowers begin to bloom.  Underground bulbs can also be eaten raw or cooked.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from Latin ursus meaning bear in reference to the proclivity of bears to dig up and eat these bulbs in the wild.An additional common name for this plant is bear's garlic.  Common name of ramsons is from Middle English ramsyn.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Mildew, rust and leaf spots may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Wild garlic is an attractive spring-flowering perennial which may be grown for both ornamental and culinary uses.  This plant should only be located in garden areas where its invasive spread will not interfere with other plantings.  Flowering drifts can be a sight of great beauty on the forest floor, but are not so beautiful when  they begin to form in a perennial border.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus cordata, commonly called Italian alder, is a pyramidal, fast-growing, small to medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Corsica and southern Italy. It typically grows to 30-50’ in cultivation. It is particularly noted for its attractive glossy green leaves. Flowers are monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same tree) appearing in catkins. Male catkins are yellow-green (elongated to 2-3” long). Female catkins are reddish-green but very small (1/4"" long). Catkins appear in March before the leaves emerge. Female catkins are followed by 1-inch long fruiting cones (strobiles) composed of winged seeds. These fruiting cones (largest in the Alnus genus) resemble small pine cones and are attractive to birds. They mature to reddish-brown in fall and persist into winter. Mature bark is a light gray-brown with fissures and ridging. Ovate, finely toothed, glossy green leaves (to 2-4"" long) remain on the tree late into fall (December), with insignificant fall color produced. Trees can fix nitrogen from the air.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet means heart-shaped in reference to the leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Canker can be severe. Watch for aphids, leaf miners, tent caterpillars, lace bugs and flea beetles. Powdery mildew may appear. Chlorosis will occur in high pH soils.
","
Garden Uses
Good selection for difficult sites such as moist low spots or dry sites with poor soils. Effective as a windbreak.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus glutinosa, commonly called black alder (also common alder or European alder), is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that is distinguished by its gummy young twigs and leaves and its obovate to rounded, glossy dark green leaves (to 4” long) with doubly toothed margins and blunt to sometimes notched apices. As a single trunk tree, it typically grows to 40-60’ tall in cultivation (to 100’ or more in its native habitat) with a narrow pyramidal form. As a multi-trunked tree, it grows much smaller and spreads. It has naturalized in many parts of eastern North America, particularly along streams and in low or swampy sites. Flowers are monoecious. Drooping male catkins (to 4” long) form in fall and overwinter on the tree. Small, plump, rounded female catkins form in late winter to early spring. The catkins flower in March before the foliage emerges. After flowering, the female catkins develop into 3/4-inch long woody cones (strobiles), with winged seeds forming therein. The seeds disperse in fall at maturity, but the woody cones typically remain on the tree over winter and persist into the following growing season. Alders are easily identified in winter by the presence of the drooping male catkins and the woody cones, both of which are ornamentally attractive. Winter branches are often added to floral arrangements. Dark brown bark with warty striping gives rise to the black alder common name. No appreciable fall color. Nitrogen fixing microorganisms develop in nodules on the tree roots in somewhat the same manner as with the legumes.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet means sticky or glutinous for its gummy twigs and leaves.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus maritima, commonly called seaside alder, is a deciduous, multi-trunked, upright-rounded, fall-blooming large shrub or small tree that typically grows to 20-30' tall.  It is usually found in wet soils at low elevations along ponds, streams and rivers, including some dense pure stands in swamp-like areas with standing water.  It is an uncommon to rare species that is native to the U. S. where it occurs in three small disjunct populations, with each population now being classified as a separate subspecies:  (1) Alnus maritima subsp. maritima (coastal plain of Delaware and Maryland - Delmarva Peninsula); (2) Alnus maritima subsp. georgiensis (Bartow county in NW Georgia); and (3) Alnus maritima subsp. oklahomensis (Johnson and Pontotoc Counties in south central Oklahoma near the upper Blue River).  Notwithstanding the remote locations of these three subspecies, fossil records seem to suggest that this Alnus maritima once enjoyed a much larger geographic distribution many years ago.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning growing by the sea.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Alnus serrulata, commonly called tag alder, smooth alder or hazel alder, is a multi-stemmed, suckering, thicket-forming, large deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-20’ tall.  It is most often seen in a multi-trunked form with a densely branched crown. It is native to boggy ground along streams/lakes/rivers, wetland margins, springs, spring-fed meadows, ditches and swampy fields from Nova Scotia to Illinois and Missouri south to eastern Texas and northern Florida.  

Trunks feature smooth gray bark with inconspicuous lenticels (pores).  Flowers are monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same tree), appearing in separate catkins in March-early April before the leaves emerge.  Male catkins (brownish-yellow flowers) are slender, cylindrical and droop in clusters of 2-5 from near the branch tips to 2-4"" long.  Female catkins (bright red flowers) are upright cylinders (to 1/4"" long) located at the twig tips in clusters of 2-5.  Female flowers are pollinated by wind.  Female catkins develop into 1-inch long fruiting cones (strobiles) to 3/4” long containing winged nutlets (seeds).  Fruiting cones mature to dark brown in fall, with persistence into winter.  Cones have woody scales and resemble small pine cones.  Birds feed on the seed.   Broad elliptic to obovate dull green leaves (2-4"" long) with serrulate margins are wedge-shaped at the base and pointed at the tip.  Insignificant fall color.  Root nodules fix nitrogen.  

Alnus serrulata is very similar in appearance to Alnus incana subsp. rugosa.Genus name is the Latin name for alder.Specific epithet is in reference to serrulate leaf margins.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Canker can be severe.  Powdery mildew and leaf curl may appear.  Watch for aphids, leaf miners, tent caterpillars, lace bugs and flea beetles.  Chlorosis will occur in high pH soils.
","
Garden Uses
Best for moist areas of the landscape.  Tolerates poor soils.  Streambanks.  Pond margins.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where plants are best grown in part shade or filtered sun in moist to wet, organically rich soils in sheltered locations protected from strong winds which can seriously damage the huge ornamental leaves.  Leaves often scorch when exposed to full sun.  Plants will grow in periodically flooded areas.  Petioles weaken and are unable to support the leaves in too much shade. 

Where not winter hardy, rhizomes may be started indoors in early spring in pots or containers.  After last spring frost date, containers/pots may be sunk to the rim in the garden or set out on a patio.  Plants require regular watering and fertilization.  Before first fall frost, pots and containers should be brought inside where they can be overwintered in sunny, humid but cool (around 60-65 degrees F) locations.  Reduce watering in winter.  Return plants to the garden in spring.  Propagate by reddish seeds which develop on the spadix in a manner reminiscent of corn on the cob.  

Plants grow rapidly and may be grown as annuals in USDA Zones 4-8.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alocasia macrorrhizos, commonly called giant taro or upright elephant ears, is a rhizomatous tropical perennial of the arum family that is treasured both for its giant ornamentally decorative leaves which resemble the ears of an elephant and its edible rhizomes which have been cultivated for many years in the tropics as an edible vegetable  under the common name of taro.  This is a forest understory plant that has widely naturalized over large tropical areas extending from India to Southeast Asia to Malayasia, however it is unclear as to the specific geographic regions where this plant was originally native.  It is closely related to Colocasia, except for the position of the leaves (upright Alocasia leaves point skyward on rigid stems whereas drooping Colocasia leaves point toward the ground).  

Thick, cordate, prominently-veined, wavy-edged green leaves (to 3-6’ long and 3-4’ wide) are borne on rigid stalks (long-sheathed petioles) which emerge from a stout upright trunk (becoming woody with age) which can eventually grow to as much as 6’ tall.  The entire plant can eventually grow to as much as 12-15’ tall in optimum growing conditions with a spread to 6-10’ wide.  

Greenish spathe and spadix (Jack-in-the pulpit type) stand 8-10” tall (flowers are packed into the spadix and surrounded by the spathe).  Flowers are not particularly showy.  .  Flowers bloom intermittently throughout the year.  Flowers are followed by red berry-like fruits which are infrequently formed in cultivation.   

Notwithstanding its ornamental features, this giant taro is also an edible root vegetable.  It has been harvested for many years in the tropics as a potato-like substitute in areas where potatoes will not grow.  Stem pith is also edible.  Rhizomes and stems must first be cooked (usually boiled) prior to eating in order to remove calcium oxalates which render uncooked rhizomes and stems inedible.  Stem pith is typically boiled, and then dried and ground into flour.Genus name comes from the Greek words a meaning without and Colocasia the name of a closely allied genus, from which it was separated.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and rrhiza meaning root in reference to plant rhizomes.Alocasia is similar to but not identical to Colocasia.

Problems
Watch for spider mites, scale, mealy bugs and aphids.

Garden Uses
Bold foliage plant for frost-free areas in part shade.   In areas where not winter hardy, plants may be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors.  Also may be grown as a houseplant (best in sun room or hothouse).  Plants grown indoors need high humidity.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10-12. In St. Louis, it may be grown indoors in containers. As a houseplant, it is easily grown in sandy well-drained commercial potting loams. Best sited in full sun, but this plant seems to adapt to some part shade. It needs bright light for flowering. Tolerant of drought and dry indoor air. Water very moderately in spring, summer and fall, but reduce watering to the minimum in winter. Tolerates 50F to 60F degree nights in summer with a minimum of 40F degrees in winter. Plants taken outside for summer should be protected from rain, and should be brought indoors in early fall before night temperatures begin to dip below 50F degrees. Easily propagated from offsets that appear near the base of mature plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aloe vera, commonly called medicinal aloe, is a stoloniferous, stemless, tropical perennial that grows upright with stiff rosettes of succulent leaves. Common name is in reference to the folk medicine history of this plant which goes back to the pre-Christian era. Lance-shaped green leaves (to 18” long) are spotted white and armed with whitish marginal teeth. Leaves mature to gray-green. Plants may grow to as much as 3’ tall. Flowering occurs only on mature plants, typically in summer. On container plants, flowering will only occur on plants grown in optimum conditions (e.g., sunny windows or sunny outdoor locations). Yellow flowers in racemes bloom atop erect stalks rising to as much as 3’ tall. Medicinal aloe is noted for the healing and cosmetic properties attributed to its sap. The sap is added to a large number of commercial cosmetics, particularly lotions and creams. Sap is noted for its ability to moisten dry skin. Sap from a broken leaf may be applied directly to burns on the skin for relief. Sap should not be eaten, but has been used in the past for treating peptic ulcers. The sap also reportedly has strong laxative properties. Medicinal aloe is also commonly called burn plant or burn aloe. Synonymous with and formerly known as Aloe barbadensis.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia galanga, commonly known as Siamese ginger, Thai ginger or galangal, is a tropical evergreen perennial with a thick aromatic rhizome.  It is native to Southeast Asia.  For culinary use, the rhizome is typically cut up into small pieces, thin-sliced, pounded into a paste, or dried and powdered for inclusion as a flavoring in a variety of food dishes such as soups and curries.  It is reportedly one of the most frequently used spices in Thai cooking, and is also quite popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.  Indonesian rendang is usually flavored with this rhizome.  Each plant typically grows to 6' tall in a clump of stalks clad with long green leaves (12-15"" long by 2-3"" wide).  Showy yellowish-white flowers with red centers bloom throughout the year on upright inflorescences.  Flowers are followed by red fruits (1/2"" diameter) which emerge green and then turn yellow before finally maturing to red.  Leaves, stalks, rhizomes and seeds all have a mild aromatic aroma.  Foliage is attractive and plants may be grown ornamentally without harvesting the rhizome.  Plants are evergreen when grown in frost-free locations.  In Southern Asia, fresh rhizomes are commonly sold in markets.  Rhizomes also have certain folk medicinal uses in Asia.  In the U.S., rhizomes are generally available for purchase in most Asian groceries.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Languas galanga.Genus name honors Italian botanist Prospero Alpino (1553-1616).

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Some nurseries currently claim that shell ginger can be grown outdoors year-round in USDA Zone 7 with winter protection. Plants appreciate some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. In St. Louis, this plant is often grown as a houseplant or in the greenhouse. As a houseplant, it must have bright light and humid conditions. Prune as needed to control plant size. It may also be grown outdoors in the garden, but rhizomes should be dug and stored indoors for winter in a dry medium (as vermiculite) in a cool room. Plants will not flower until the second year (flower on old growth), so if grown outdoors, either as annuals or for overwintering indoors, they generally will not flower and must be enjoyed only for their attractive foliage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia zerumbet, commonly called shell ginger is native to eastern Asia. It is a rhizomatous, evergreen perennial that grows in upright clumps to 8-10’ tall. It more typically reaches 4-8’ tall in the greenhouse and 3-4’ tall as a houseplant. It is commonly called shell ginger because its individual shell pink flowers, particularly when in bud, resemble sea shells and its rhizomes have a ginger-like aroma. It is distinguished from other members of the ginger family by the fact that its flowers droop from the ends of leafy stems rather than rise directly from plant rhizomes. Waxy, light pink flower buds open to tubular flowers with yellow inside lips and red throats. Flowers are fragrant. Flowers appear in drooping racemes (to 1’ long) in summer. Lance-shaped green leaves to 2’ long and 5” wide.Genus name honors Italian botanist Prospero Alpino (1553-1616).

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in sunny locations. Appreciates some afternoon shade or sun-dappled shade in hot summer climates. Finger-like roots should be spread over a mound of soil in somewhat the same manner as used for planting bare root roses. Winter hardy to USDA Zone 7 (with winter protection), but will not survive most St. Louis winters (Zone 5b to 6a). In St. Louis, plants are best grown in containers which must be brought indoors in winter with very minimal watering. If planted in the ground, alstroemeria clumps may be dug and overwintered indoors a moist medium in a cool location, however it should be noted that the roots are very brittle and difficult to dig. Where they can be planted permanently in the ground, plants will naturalize by creeping roots to form colonies in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alstroemeria aurea, commonly called Peruvian lily, is a tuberous perennial native to South America. Terminal clusters of small, lily-like flowers top slender, upright stems growing in bushy clumps to 2-3' tall. Flowers in yellow or orange, often with spotting and streaking. Blooms in summer. Narrow, twisted, lance-shaped leaves to 4"" long. Synonymous with A. aurantiaca. Hybrid strains of alstroemeria have become extremely popular commercial cut flowers and are available in a wide range colors, including orange, yellow, red, pink, purple, lavender, salmon and white.Genus name honors Swedish botanist Klaus von Alstroemer (1736-1794) who was a student and friend of Carolus Linnaeus.Specific epithet means golden.

Culture
Tropical perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zone 10 and is grown exclusively for its colorful foliage. Grow in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage colors are usually developed in full sun, however some bleaching of colors may occur in full sun in hot summer climates. In the St. Louis area, it is typically grown outdoors as an annual (e.g., ground cover, edger or in containers), but may also be grown indoors as a houseplant as long as it is sited in a bright, sunny location and soils are kept moist. Plants may be grown from seed by starting them indoors in late winter and transplanting them outdoors after last frost date. Quality of leaf color may vary considerably and only the best seedlings should be selected for inclusion in the planting. Plant 4-9” apart for ground cover effect. Pinching stems or shearing will keep plants compact and bushy. For those who do not wish to plant seed, some of the more popular varieties are available from nurseries in cell packs or flats. Smaller plants may be potted up and brought inside in winter. In the alternative, tip cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering indoors.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alternanthera ficoidea is a low-growing plant that typically grows on erect to procumbent stems to 6-12” tall. It is native from Mexico to Argentina.; Species plants have elliptic to broad ovate green leaves (to 1” long). However it is the brightly colored cultivars that have become the popular garden plants, featuring green leaves blotched with yellow, orange, red, brown, copper or purple, sometimes with red veining. Foliage of the brighter colored cultivars is suggestive of coleus. White apetalous flowers appear stalkless or on short stalks in small axillary clusters in late fall to winter, but are insignificant. Flowers are usually observed in St. Louis only on houseplants or on container plants brought inside for overwintering. Plants in the genus Alternanthera have a rather large number of descriptive common names, including but not limited to Joseph’s coat, copperleaf, calico plant, bloodleaf, joyweed and parrot leaf, all in reference to the brilliantly colored leaves which provide foliage contrast to gardens and container plantings.Genus name comes from the Latin words alternans meaning alternating and anthera meaning anther. Alternate anthers in the genus are barren.Specific epithet means resembling fig (Ficus).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Bedding plant, edger or containers. Foliage is particularly attractive when plants are massed as a ground cover or edger. Plants of this species have been used since Victorian times in clipped formal plantings. Also can be an attractive houseplant.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in moist, average, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best flowering in full sun, but appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date or purchase starter plants. When grown from seed, flowers usually don’t appear until approximately 3 months after sowing. Set out plants after last frost date. Space smaller varieties 8-12” apart and larger varieties to 18” apart. Seed may be harvested from garden plants for planting the following year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Amaranthus caudatus commonly called love-lies-bleeding or tassel flower, gets its unusual common name from its tiny blood red petalless flowers that bloom in narrow, drooping, tassel-like, terminal and axillary panicles throughout the growing season. Panicles typically hang straight down to 12” (infrequently to 24”) long. Native to India, Africa and Peru, this is an annual that usually grows 2-4’ tall in the St. Louis area. Cultivars with yellow-green flowers are also available. Oval, light green leaves (to 6” long). The seeds of this species are edible, and species plants are grown as a grain crop in some parts of South America. This plant is an everlasting whose flowers retain good color when dried for arrangements.Genus name comes from the Greek word amarantos meaning unfading in reference to the long-lasting flowers of some species.Specific epithet means having a tail in reference to appearance of the flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Susceptible viruses, aster yellows and fungal leaf spot diseases. Plants grown in the ground may need staking or other support. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Best in hanging baskets where drooping flowers are best seen. May be used in beds or borders. Interesting edging along walks or paths.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in moist, average, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date or purchase starter plants. Set out plants after last frost date. Space smaller varieties 8-12” apart and larger varieties to 18” apart. Seed may be harvested from garden plants for planting the following year or cuttings may be taken from favorite plants in late summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Amaranthus tricolor, commonly called Joseph’s coat, is grown not for its flowers but for its beautifully colored foliage. It is an upright, bushy annual that typically grows to 2-4’ tall in the St. Louis area. Species plants feature ovate to elliptic, green to purple leaves (to 10” long). However a number of cultivars are available in commerce featuring leaves brilliantly blotched with various shades of yellow, red, pink and/or copper, with the upper plant leaves often contrasting in color from the lower ones. Green-leaved species plants are sometimes grown as a vegetable crop (spinach substitute). Species plants are also sometimes commonly called tampala, particularly when grown for culinary use. Tiny green to red flowers in 1” axillary spikes are insignificant.Genus name comes from the Greek word amarantos meaning unfading in reference to the long-lasting flowers of some species.Specific epithet means three-colored.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Susceptible viruses, aster yellows and fungal leaf spot diseases. Plants grown in the ground may need staking or other support.
","
Garden Uses
Beds or borders. Interesting edging along walks or paths. Containers.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a somewhat wide range of soils. Root suckers are common, and if not removed, will result in a shrubby growth habit for the plant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Amelanchier alnifolia is a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree which may grow to 18' tall. Features showy, 5-petaled, white flowers (to 3/4"" diameter) in compact clusters which appear in early spring (April) before the leaves. Flowers give way to small, round, edible berries which ripen to dark purplish-black in June and resemble blueberries in size, color and taste. Berries may be eaten fresh off the plant or used in jams, jellies and pies. Finely-toothed, oval-rounded leaves are pale to dark green. Foliage turns variable shades of yellow in autumn. The species is commonly called Saskatoon serviceberry or western serviceberry, and some species cultivars have been grown commercially for fruit production.Genus name comes from a French provincial name for Amelanchier ovalis a European plant in this genus.Specific epithet means leaves like the genus Alnus in reference to the similarity of the leaves of this species to common alder (Alnus glutinosa).'Regent' is a compact, deciduous, stoloniferous, early-flowering cultivar which typically grows only 4-6' tall. Edible berries resemble blueberries in size and color and are often used in jams, jellies and pies.
","
Problems
No serious problems. Rust, leaf spot, fire blight and powdery mildew are occasional disease problems, and sawfly, leaf miner, borers, and scale are occasional insect pests.
","
Garden Uses
Best in shrub borders, woodland gardens or naturalized areas, especially with dark or shaded backdrops which tend to highlight the form, flowers and fall color of the plant. Also effective along stream banks and ponds.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Amelanchier laevis, commomly called Allegheny serviceberry, is a small, deciduous, usually multi-trunked understory tree or tall shrub which is native to thickets, open woods, sheltered slopes and wood margins in Eastern North America where it typically grows 15-25' (less frequently to 40') tall. Features showy, 5-petaled, slightly fragrant, white flowers in drooping clusters which appear in early spring (April) before the leaves. Flowers give way to small, round, edible berries which ripen to dark purplish-black in June (hence the sometimes common name of Juneberry) and resemble blueberries in size, color and taste. Berries are often used in jams, jellies and pies. Finely-toothed, obovate leaves emerge with a bronzish-purple tinge in spring, mature to lustrous dark green in summer and turn red-orange in fall. This tree is primarily distinguished from the very similar Missouri native downy serviceberry (A. arborea) by its hairless foliage, purplish-tinged new growth and tastier (sweeter and juicier) berries.Genus name comes from a French provincial name for Amelanchier ovalis a European plant in this genus.Specific epithet means hairless or smooth for the foliage.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rust, leaf spot, fire blight, powdery mildew and canker are occasional disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Attractive understory tree for lawns, shrub borders, woodland margins or native plant areas. Shrub forms can be grown as tall informal hedges or screens. Good plant for bird gardens (birds love the berries).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Amelanchier lamarckii is of unknown origin. Although generally considered to be a distinct North American species, some experts believe it to be a naturally occurring hybrid that comes true from seed and designate it as A. x lamarckii. Of the hybrid theorists, some claim the parentage to be A. canadensis x A. laevis, whereas others assert the parentage to be A. arborea x A. laevis and find synonymity with A. x grandiflora. In light of this confusion over designation, it is not clear that all samples sold in commerce as A. lamarckii will in fact be A lamarckii. Nevertheless, this serviceberry is a deciduous, understory tree or tall shrub that typically grows 15-25’ tall. It is very similar in appearance to A. laevis, with the exception that its young stems and leaves are sericeous (silky haired) whereas those of A. laevis are smooth. Otherwise both plants feature showy, 5-petaled, slightly fragrant, white flowers in drooping clusters that appear in early spring (April) before the leaves. Flowers give way to small, round, edible berries which ripen to dark purplish-black in June (hence the common name of Juneberry) and resemble blueberries in size, color and taste. Berries are often used in jams, jellies and pies. Finely-toothed, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3” long) emerge bronze-purple in spring, mature to dark green in summer and turn red-orange in fall.Genus name comes from a French provincial name for Amelanchier ovalis a European plant in this genus.Species name honors Jean Baptiste Antoine Monet de Lamarck, 18th century French naturalist.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Amelanchier nantucketensis, commonly called Nantucket juneberry or Nantucket shadbush, is a compact, slender, low-growing, deciduous shrub in the rose family.  It typically grows to 4-5’ tall, spreading over time by stolons to form dense colonies.  It is a globally rare shrub that is primarily native to sunny, dry, sandy habitats including old fields, grasslands, sandplains, pine barrens, ridges/ledges, roadsides and disturbed sites in a very limited number of locations scattered mostly along the Atlantic coastal plain from Nova Scotia and Maine to Massachusetts (Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard), New York (Long Island), New Jersey, Maryland and the northeastern tip of Virginia.  It is also sometimes found along rivers and lakes.  This shrub is noted for its  (1) small 5-petaled white flowers which bloom in short racemes in April-May, (2) edible fleshy dark blue to black berries (pomes to 3/8” diameter) which ripen in June-July, (3) finely-toothed, glabrous, shiny green leaves (to 1 1/2” long) from spring to fall, (4) orange-red fall foliage color, and (5) presence of pollen directly on flower petal margins (andropetalous).  Amelanchier stolonifera forma micropetala is now considered by some authorities to be synonymous with A. nantucketensis, which has slightly expanded the limited geographic range of the within species.  

This species is similar to Amelanchier obovalis (coastal juneberry which is native to coastal plain woods from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia south to Georgia and Alabama) except for its small hairless shiny leaves (to 1 1/2” long) with hairy leafstalks.

This species is a fully sponsored plant on the CPC (Center for Plant Conservation) National Collection of Endangered Plants list, with The Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University as primary custodian.Genus name comes from a French provincial name for Amelanchier ovalis a European plant in this genus.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to Nantucket Island where this plant is somewhat common.Common names of juneberry (fruits mature in June) and shadbush (shad begin to run in local rivers at the time of flowering) are descriptive of shrub characteristics.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Amelanchier stolonifera, commonly called running serviceberry, is a deciduous, early-flowering, stoloniferous shrub which typically suckers and spreads to form thickets. It usually grows to only 3-5' tall and features 5-petaled, showy, white flowers in drooping clusters which appear before the leaves emerge in early spring. Finely toothed, oval to almost circular, medium to dark green leaves (1-3"" long) lack teeth on lower edges and change to variable shades of yellow, orange and red in autumn. Flowers give way to small, round, green berries which mature to a dark purplish-black in summer. Edible berries resemble blueberries in size and color and are often used in pies. Amelanchiers are also commonly called Juneberries.Genus name comes from a French provincial name for Amelanchier ovalis a European plant in this genus.Specific epithet means having stolons for rooting runners.
","
Problems
Rust, leaf spot, fire blight and powdery mildew are occasional disease problems and sawfly, leaf miner, borers, and scale are occasional insect pests.
","
Garden Uses
Best in shrub borders, or in woodland, naturalized or native plant gardens. Also effective along stream banks and ponds. The plant's small size lends itself well to growing in rock gardens.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Amorpha canescens, commonly called called lead plant, is a Missouri native that typically occurs in open woodlands, glades and prairies. This pea/bean family member is a somewhat ungainly, deciduous shrub growing 1-3' tall and featuring slender, dense, 4-8"" spike-like clusters of tiny, bluish-purple flowers with gold anthers which bloom in May-June. It also features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with grayish green leaflets and densely hairy twigs.Genus name comes from the Greek word amorphos meaning shapeless or deformed in reference to the corolla of this pea family genus lacking wings and a keel.Specific epithet means with off-white or ashy-grey hairs in reference to the leaves and twigs.The genus Amorpha is often called false indigo because of its resemblance to plants of the genus Indigofera. Common name of lead plant refers to the once held belief that the plant was an indicator of the presence of lead in the ground.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
False indigo is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to 4-12' (less frequently to 20') tall with a spread often in excess of its height.  It is native to moist open woodland areas, floodplains, stream banks and swamp margins from central to eastern Canada south throughout much of the U. S. into northern Mexico.  It features compound, odd-pinnate leaves (each to 12"" long).  Each leaf contains 11 to 35 spiny-tipped, oval to elliptic, dull gray-green leaflets (to 2"" long) with glandular dots and toothless margins.  Tubular scented flowers (each to 3/8"" long) bloom in May-June in dense, spike-shaped clusters (racemes) to 8"" long.  Each flower has a single-petaled purple corolla and 10 protruding stamens with showy orange-yellow anthers.  Flowers are followed by fruits in small, resinous-dotted, 1-2 seeded pods (to 1/2"" long) which mature in July and August.  This shrub grows much larger than Amorpha canescens (lead plant).Genus name comes from the Greek word amorphos meaning shapeless or deformed in reference to the corolla of this pea family genus lacking wings and a keel.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word frutex meaning shrub in reference to its shrubby form.Plants contain indigo pigment, but in quantities too small for commercial use (hence the common name of false indigo).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to leaf spot, powdery mildew, twig canker and rust.
","
Garden Uses
False indigo has attractive flowers.  It is often used for erosion control, windbreaks and screens. Good shrub for moist naturalized areas or areas with poor soils.

This plant is a candidate for inclusion on the Federal Endangered Species list.Genus name comes from the Greek word amorphos meaning shapeless or deformed in reference to the corolla of this pea family genus lacking wings and a keel.Specific epithet refers to the Ouachita Mountains its native range.The genus Amorpha is often called false indigo because of its resemblance to plants of the genus Indigofera.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spots, rust, powdery mildew and canker.
","
Garden Uses
This endangered plant probably can not be found in commerce. If it could be obtained, its rare status would seem to dictate utilizing it as a specimen or accent plant, even though it is a rather ordinary looking, small shrub with an attractive bloom but otherwise no particularly outstanding landscape features.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Ampelopsis aconitifolia, commonly called monkshood vine, is a vigorous, woody, deciduous, tendril-climbing vine which typically grows 15-25'. The species features palmate, mostly 5-parted, glossy deep green leaves somewhat reminiscent of perennial monkshood (Aconitum). Clusters (cymes) of non-showy, greenish flowers appear in the leaf axils in late summer. Flowers give way to clusters of rounded-to-oval, bluish fruits (1/4"" diameter) which mature to orange-yellow in autumn.

Var. glabra is almost identical to the species except it features 3-parted leaves. Glabra means smooth.Genus name comes from the Greek words ampelos meaning a vine and opsis meaning likeness. It is closely related to grape vines.Specific epithet means with leaves like the genus Aconitum.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to light shade. Prefers sandy soils with regular moisture and sharp drainage. Best fall foliage color usually occurs in full sun, but flowers generally last longer if given some light afternoon shade in hot sun areas. Stems tend to open up and flop in too much shade. Consider cutting back the stems to 8-10” after flowering to promote bushy growth and, if desired, to further reduce the outside stem height so as to create a more rounded foliage mound.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Amsonia ciliata is a clump-forming perennial that is native from North Carolina to Florida west to Missouri, Arkansas and Texas. It is generally found in sandy soils. It typically grows to 2-3’ tall. Terminal clusters of star-like, light blue flowers bloom in mid spring (May) atop generally erect stems clad with narrow, almost needle-like, green leaves. Foliage turns attractive shades of yellow in fall. This plant is commonly called bluestar or fringed bluestar or downy amsonia.Genus name honors 18th-century Virginian physician Dr. Charles Amson.Specific epithet means hairy-margined in reference to the fringe of hairs found on new leaves and plant stems (hence the sometimes use of fringed or downy in the common name).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Amsonia hubrichtii, commonly called bluestar, Arkansas amsonia or Hubricht's amsonia, is an uncommon perennial that is native to the Ouachita Mountains in central Arkansas. It is very similar in appearance to the Missouri native Amsonia ciliata, except the leaves of A. hubrichtii are more narrow and thread-like and the emerging foliage lacks conspicuous hairiness. An erect, clump-forming plant that is primarily grown in cultivation for its blue spring flowers, feathery green summer foliage and golden fall color. Powdery blue, 1/2"" star-like flowers appear in terminal clusters in late spring atop stems rising to 3' tall. Feathery, soft-textured, needle-like, alternate leaves are bright green in spring and summer, but turn bright gold in autumn. From a distance plants have an almost lily-like appearance. 

Specific epithet honors Leslie Hubricht who first discovered it growing in the wild in the early 1940s.Genus name honors 18th-century Virginian physician Dr. Charles Amson.Specific epithet honors Leslie Hubricht who first discovered it growing in the wild in the early 1940s.

Culture
Pineapple is a shallow rooted tropical fruit that is grown outdoors in frost free areas where temperatures typically range from 65 to 95 degrees F. It is best grown in acidic, loose, sandy, organically rich, well-drained soils. Pineapple plants are primarily propagated by crowns (leafy clumps atop mature fruits), slips (on peduncles below the fruit), suckers (along the stem) or to a lesser degree by old stems. In temperate regions, pineapples are grown indoors in warm greenhouses or in containers as houseplants. Indoor plants require a consistently moist soil, bright sun, high humidity and an air temperature that does not dip below 65 degrees F. Fruits may not appear on indoor plants during the first few years. Indoor fruits are usually quite small and not particularly tasty, but are ornamentally attractive. For home gardening, (a) remove the leafy crown (by twisting or cutting) from a commercial pineapple, (b) remove any remaining yellow fruit attached to the crown, (c) dry the crown for one or two days, (d) place the crown in a moist potting soil mix or in water until roots appear and (e) plant the crown in a container of well-draining bromeliad-type potting soil. Containers may be taken outside in summer and placed in full sun locations, but should be brought back indoors when night temperatures begin to dip below 60 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ananas comosus, commonly called pineapple, is a terrestrial bromeliad that was originally discovered growing in tropical areas of South America (principally Brazil). Carib Indians reportedly brought this plant to the Caribbean. Columbus saw his first pineapple on Guadeloupe in 1493. During the 1500s and 1600s, this fruit was distributed around the world with the help of sailing ships. Today, pineapples are one of the most popular fruits in the world. In tropical areas, they are grown both commercially for their excellent fruit and ornamentally as landscape plants. In temperate regions such as St. Louis, they may be grown in warm greenhouses or indoors as houseplants. In warm areas such as southern Florida, southern Texas or southern California, plants may be grown outdoors in protected locations, but such plants are intolerant of frost and will weaken and show damage from winter temperatures significantly below 60 degrees F. Outdoors, pineapple plants typically grow 3-4’ tall (leaves to 3’ or more and fruit to 1’ taller) and as wide. Stiff, tough, narrow, sword-shaped, evergreen, gray-green leaves usually with sawtoothed edges appear in basal rosettes. Prior to flowering, the stem in the rosette center lengthens and enlarges. Purple or red flowers (50-200) then bloom in a large inflorescence. Topped by a compact crown of leaves, the pineapple fruit (a syncarp) forms and matures to 12” long or more with a weight up to 14 pounds.Genus name comes from the South American (Tupi) Indian name.Specific epithet means with a tuft in probable reference to the flowers and fruit produced in a tuft above the foliage.
","
Problems
Wilt and root rot can be significant. Watch for nematodes, scale, thrips and mealybugs.
","
Garden Uses
Fruit production or ornamental plant for tropical and other frost free areas. Warm greenhouses or houseplant for temperate regions.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Some light afternoon shade is appreciated in hot and humid St. Louis summers. Needs excellent drainage, but avoid dry soils.  Loves deep, rich, fertile soils, but is more invasive therein and tends to grow taller and flop more.  Taller plants do best with some form of staking or support.  Plants benefit from a winter mulch on the root zone, but not on the crowns.  Can be short-lived in the garden.  Prompt deadheading of spent flowers may prolong the bloom period and will help prevent any unwanted self-seeding.   If foliage turns unsightly in summer after bloom, plants may be cut back hard.   Plants may also be cut back hard in early autumn to aid in overwintering.  Plants may be propagated by seed, division in spring or root cuttings.  May readily self-seed (sometimes aggressively) and naturalize in the garden in optimum growing conditions, but cultivars of this plant generally do not come true from seed and should be propagated by root cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anchusa azurea, commonly known as alkanet or Italian bugloss, is a coarse, hairy, spring-blooming, clump-forming, short-lived perennial of the borage family that typically grows to 3-5’ tall.  It is native to the Mediterranean but has been introduced in North America where it has escaped gardens and naturalized in British Columbia plus a number of States in the U.S.   Alternate, entire, hispid, linear-elliptic to lanceolate leaves (to 6” long) are sessile or clasping at the base.  Deep blue to violet flowers (to 3/4” diameter) are reminiscent of forget-me-nots (Myosotis).  Flowers bloom in loose terminal spikes (scorpioid cymes) rising above the foliage in late spring to early summer.Genus name comes from the Greek word ankousa in reference to a root pigment which was once used as a cosmetic paint for staining the skin.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word azureus meaning sky blue in reference to flower color.Alkanet is a red dye made from the roots of some plants in the genus Anchusa.
","
Problems
Crown rot can be a significant problem, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils.  Taller plants usually need some kind of unobtrusive staking or support.  Plant stems tend to open up and flop and foliage tends to depreciate in summer after bloom, particularly in hot and humid summer climates such as the St. Louis area.

Culture
Easily grown in average, moist, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Intolerant of dry soils.  This grass is not reliably winter hardy to the northern parts of USDA Zone 6 where it should be grown in a protected location.  It freely self seeds in optimum growing conditions.  Cut clumps to the ground in late winter to early spring just before new shoots appear.  It should be noted that the moist soil preference for this species distinguishes it from most other species of Andropogon including the Missouri native Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Andropogon capillipes, commonly known as bushy bluestem, bushy beardgrass or bushy broom grass, is a warm season, clump-forming, ornamental bunchgrass which is typically grown for its attractive foliage and feathery, club shaped flower/seed panicles.  It is native to the southeastern U.S. (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) where it typically occurs in moist soils in swamp peripheries, marshes, pastures, low spots and coastal areas.  This grass features an erect clump of flattened blue-green leaf blades (to 1/ 2” wide) which typically grow to 2-4’ tall with a spread to 3” wide.  Flower stalks are topped by dense, fluffy, narrow, silvery white flower panicles (plumes) which rise above the foliage in late summer to early fall to as much as 6’ tall.  The bushy and broom-like inflorescences (hence the common names of this species) are quite attractive.  After frost, the foliage and bushy panicles turn coppery-orange with the panicles softening into billowy plumes.  Fall foliage color persists well into winter providing good ornamental interest.  Seed plumes are attractive in dried flower arrangements.Genus name comes from the Greek words aner or andros meaning man and pogon meaning beard in reference to the hairs on the spikelets of some species in the genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word capilliformis meaning hairlike.‘Valdosta Blue’ was selected from an area near Valdosta, Georgia.  This cultivar is sometimes commonly called chalky bluestem in reference to its attractive powder blue foliage.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Winter hardiness may be a problem in the St. Louis area.

Puts out lots of growth in moist, fertile soils, but is less apt to topple in dryish, infertile soils. Freely self-seeds in optimum growing conditions. This grass develops an extensive root system and is somewhat slow to establish, but, once established, has excellent drought tolerance and is easy to maintain. Cut stems to the ground in late winter before new shoots appear.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Andropogon gerardii, commonly called big bluestem grass, is a tall, Missouri native, perennial, warm season grass that was the dominant grass of the tallgrass prairie which once covered large parts of the Midwest. It may be grown as an ornamental grass because of its attractive foliage which changes color seasonally, its good architectural height and its interesting flower/seed heads. It features an upright clump of stems with flattened leaves (to 2' long and 3/8"" wide) which emerge gray to blue green in spring, mature to green with red tinges in summer and turn reddish bronze with lavender tones in autumn after frost. Flowering stems rise in late summer above the foliage clump bearing purplish 3-parted, finger-like flower clusters (to 4"" long) purportedly resembling turkey feet (hence the additional common name of turkeyfoot grass for this species). Flowering stems bring total height of this grass to 4-8' tall (typically at the taller end in moist soils and the shorter end in dry soils).Genus name comes from the Greek words aner or andros meaning man and pogon meaning beard in reference to the hairs on the spikelets of some species in the genus.Specific epithet honors Louis Gerard (1733-1819), French physician and botanist.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best massed in wildflower meadows, prairie or naturalized areas. Also effective in border rears or native plant gardens as a screen or accent. Extensive root system makes this a good grass for erosion control.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Plants grow well in full sun in northern climates, but appreciate some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Soak tubers in water overnight before planting. Plant tubers 2-3” deep and 3-5” apart in fall. Plant tubers closer together for use as a ground cover. Although called windflowers, these plants will do best if sheltered from the wind. Keep soils consistently moist throughout the growing season. Plants will naturalize by both tuberous rhizomes and by self-seeding (new seedlings bloom the second year). Plants will naturalize over time. May be planted in containers, but should be moved into a permanent spot in the garden in the fall of the year. Plants go dormant after flowering. Foliage may be cut back after it yellows.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anemone blanda, commonly called Grecian windflower, is a spreading, tuberous-rooted perennial that is native from southeastern Europe (including of course Greece) to the Caucausus and Turkey. It blooms in early spring. Plants typically grow to only 4-8” tall and feature attractive daisy-like, dark blue flowers, each of which contains 9-14 showy petal-like sepals, but no petals (apetalous). Tubers are knobby in appearance. Foliage is deeply cut and fern-like. Plants spread out to form a carpet of flowers in spring.Genus name is often said to be derived from the Greek word anemos meaning wind.Specific epithet means mild, pleasing or charming. The plants and flowers are very charming.
","
Problems
Leaf spot and rhizome rot are infrequently reported problems.
","
Garden Uses
Mix and mass for an excellent, early-blooming variety of colors for the rock garden, perennial border, wild garden or naturalized open woodland area. Excellent in large drifts under spring flowering trees. Good container plant. Form a mat like ground cover in spring, but does go dormant after flowering.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anemone canadensis, commonly known as Canada anemone, meadow anemone or roundleaf anemone, is an herbaceous perennial of the buttercup family that produces an often spectacular bloom of apetalous, upward-facing, white flowers (to 2” diameter) which bloom in spring (April-June) atop erect hairy flowering stems (to  2’ tall) clad with broad, stalkless, deeply cut and sharply-toothed orbiculate leaves.  Each flower features five showy petal-like white sepals and numerous contrasting yellow center stamens.  Flower stems rise from a basal clump of deeply-dissected, long-stalked, 3-5 lobed basal leaves.  

Canada anemone is native to river margins, river flood plains, low moist meadows, ditches and moist thickets throughout southern Canada from Newfoundland to British Columbia and in the U.S from Maine to Montana south to West Virginia, Missouri, Kansas and scattered through the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico.  It naturalizes easily (somewhat invasively in optimum growing conditions), and is often found growing in large colonies. In Missouri, concentrations are primarily found along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries.Genus name is often said to be derived from the Greek word anemos meaning wind.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to the plant in part being native to Canada.Windflower is an often used common name for plants in the genus Anemone because the upright flower stems of most genus plants typically sway in the breeze.  However, Canada anemone is a species that actually prefers a site protected from wind since strong winds can bend or break the thin flowerstalks.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Taller plants may need some support.  Foliar nematodes may feed within the leaves.  Leaf spot, downy mildew, powdery mildew and rust may appear.  Watch for caterpillars, flea beetles, and slugs.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where the tuberous rhizomes may be planted in the garden in fall about 2-3” deep and 4-6” apart in rich, sandy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Cover the bed with mulch which should be removed in late winter. Several planting options exist for the St. Louis area. First, plant tubers in pots in fall for overwintering in frost free but cool areas (e.g., greenhouse, sunporch or cold frame), with pots being set out in early spring. Second, plant tubers in pots in early spring for a later May-June bloom. Finally, tuberous rhizomes can be dug up in fall for storage over winter, but this process does not always work well. Notwithstanding the foregoing, plants are short-lived and may be best grown in the nature of annuals by simply digging up and destroying the rhizomes each spring after flowering and purchasing new rhizomes each autumn.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anemone coronaria is native to the Mediterranean region. This windflower is an upright perennial that grows from rhizomatous tubers. Leaves are medium green, with basal leaves being biternate and involucral leaves being deeply divided. Solitary, showy, poppy-like, single flowers (to 2.5” diameter), each with 6-8 sepals, bloom in spring on stems rising to 10-12” tall. Flowers are blue, red or white with black centers. Plants go dormant after flowering. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce now in large part because of the availability of more colorful cultivars in both single and double flowered forms. Popular cultivar groups include De Caen (single) and St. Brigid (double). Additional common names for this plant include poppy anemone and lilies of the field.Genus name is often said to be derived from the Greek word anemos meaning wind.Specific epithet means used for or pertaining to garlands.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Anemone cylindrica is an upright herbaceous perennial that features an attractive late spring (June-July) bloom of cup-shaped, greenish-white anemone flowers (to 3/4 across), each having five petal-like sepals and a thimble-like center containing numerous stamens with yellow anthers.  Thimbleweed typically grows to 1-2' tall.  Each plant contains two types of palmate compound deeply lobed leaves:  large basal leaves (to 4"" wide)  and a whorl of smaller stalked stem leaves located 1/2 way up the stem.  Naked flower stalks rise upward from the leaf whorl, each stalk containing a single flower.  After bloom, the center cone of each flower elongates into a cylindrical cone (to 1 1/2"" long) as the seed begins to develop.  Mature cones contain tiny dark brown seeds attached to cottony tufts which facilitate distribution of the seed by the wind (anemone from Greek means wind).  Species plants are easily distinguished by these long cylindrical seed cones which have given rise to a large number of common names including thimbleweed (thimble-shaped cone), long-fruited anemone (long cylindrical cone) and candle flower (candle-shaped cone).  This wildflower is native to prairies, dry open woods, slopes, limestone glades, pastures and roadsides throughout southern Canada south to New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri and Arizona.  It is uncommon in Missouri where it is found in dry open loess hills, loess prairies and dry open wooded hills in four counties in the far northwestern part of the State (Steyermark).Genus name is often said to be derived from the Greek word anemos meaning wind.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers fertile, consistently moist, humus-rich, neutral to slightly alkaline soils with good drainage.  Best in part shade.  Flowering stems tend to flop in too much shade.  Prefers sheltered locations with protection from wind.  Foliage tends to burn in hot, dry, sunny summer conditions.  Soils must not be allowed to dry out.  Avoid wet, poorly-drained soils, however, particularly in winter.  Plants may not survive wet overwintering conditions.  Mulch in cold winter climates.  Plants are typically slow to establish.  Propagate by division or root cuttings.  Will naturalize in the landscape by fibrous suckering roots to form colonies over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anemone hupehensis, commonly called Japanese anemone, is a fibrous-rooted,  woody-based late summer to fall flowering herbaceous perennial of the buttercup family that typically grows to 2-2 ½’ tall.  Although native to scrubs, grassy slopes and streamsides in central and southwestern China, this anemone was cultivated in Japan for many years over which time it escaped gardens and naturalized to the point where it became mistakenly considered to be a Japanese native.  Common name of Chinese anemone is sometimes used for this plant in reference to its true native habitat.  This plant typically forms a basal foliage clump to 12” tall of 3-parted, dark green leaves on long petioles.  Each leaf has large-toothed margins and is softly pubescent beneath.  Long, upright, wiry-but-graceful, branching flower stems rise well above the foliage clump in late summer to 30” tall bearing single, cup-shaped, apetalous flowers (2-3” diameter).  Each flower contains 5-7 showy, rounded, pinkish-white to pale rose-mauve tepals (modified petals) with a contrasting green button-like center surrounded by a ring of yellow stamens.  Flowers bloom late summer into fall often extending to first frost (late July/August to October).Genus name is often said to be derived from the Greek word anemos meaning wind.Specific epithet comes from Hupeh (Hubei) Province in Central China where this plant is native.Windflower is a common name for plants in the genus Anemone because upright flower stems typically sway in the breeze.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Anemone parviflora, commonly called Arctic wind-flower, northern anemone or small-flowered anemone, is an herbaceous perennial of the buttercup family that typically grows to only 6-8” tall.  Each plant features a solitary, upward-facing, white or blue-tinged flower (to 2” diameter) which blooms between June and August (depending on such factors as geographic location and elevation) atop a stiff stem rising from a small clump of three-parted basal leaves.  It is primarily native to mountain streams, mountain meadows and rocky slopes at subalpine to alpine altitudes in Alaska and Canada, but is less frequently found further south into Idaho and Utah plus in the Rocky Mountains to Colorado.  This anemone is, however, circumboreal in distribution and may also be found in northern Asia.  

Each apetalous flower has five white showy petal-like sepals surrounding a center clump of contrasting yellow stamens.  Deeply 3-parted basal leaves are wedge or fan-shaped and lobed.  Flowers are followed by fruits which develop woolly spherical heads (to 3/8” wide).Genus name is often said to be derived from the Greek word anemos meaning wind.Specific epithet means small-flowered.Windflower is an often used common name for plants in the genus Anemone because the upright flower stems of taller plants in the genus typically sway in the breeze.

Culture
Dill is an annual that is best grown in rich, light, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants are more apt to fall over in part shade. Shelter plants from strong winds. Close-planting, stakes or cages may be used to provide support. Best growth occurs in cool summer climates. Plants appreciate consistent soil moisture. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Plants tend to bolt when conditions remain dry. Sow seed directly in the ground just before the last spring frost date. Seedlings can be difficult to transplant, so seeds are usually not started indoors. Additional seeds may be planted every two weeks until early summer for purposes of extending the time when fresh leaves may be harvested. Dill seed may be harvested by placing the seed heads in paper bags to dry about 2-3 weeks after flowering (this method will also help prevent self-seeding in the garden). In St. Louis, a patch of dill will usually self-seed and produce new plants each spring. Dill may also be grown in large containers (deep roots of dill need deep containers).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anethum graveolens, commonly called dill, is an annual that is frequently grown in herb, vegetable and flower gardens not only for harvest of its aromatic leaves and seeds, but also for ornamental display of its attractive foliage and flowers. Although native to Asia Minor and the Mediterranean, dill has now been widely planted around the globe, with naturalization having occurred in parts of Europe and North America. Dill typically grows to 3-5' tall on stiff hollow stems clad with aromatic, lacy, delicate, blue-green leaves that are pinnately divided into fine, thread-like segments. Taller plants may flop and need protection from strong winds. Scented, yellow flowers bloom in mid-summer in large, flattened, compound umbels (each to 10"" diameter). Flowers are followed by aromatic seed. Leaves usually have the best flavor around the time when the flowers first open. Although leaves may be dried or frozen for later use, the leaves have by far the best flavor when harvested fresh from the garden. Dill attracts a number of beneficial insects to the garden (e.g., bees, wasps, butterflies, lacewings, tachinid flies, hover flies and lady beetles). Dill is a larval plant for the black swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek name for dill.Common name of dill reportedly comes from the norse word dilla meaning to lull or soothe. In colonial America, dill seeds were sometimes called meetinghouse seeds because they were on occasion given to children to chew during long church services.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Blight and aster yellows can cause significant damage. Watch for aphids and tomato hornworms.
","
Garden Uses
Commonly grown in herb gardens, vegetable gardens or flower borders. Also may be grown in containers. Dill leaves add subtle but distinctive flavor to a variety of dishes including fish, vegetables, soups, salads, sauces, breads, and herb butters. Dill seed is more pungent than the leaves and is the primary flavoring in dill pickles. Dill seed is also used in vinegars, sauerkraut and for flavoring root vegetables. Dill seed can be used to make an excellent tea. Flower heads are excellent in dried arrangements.

Culture
Easily grown in rich, slightly acidic, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Full sun in northern areas. Perhaps best in sun dappled shade in St. Louis. Best with consistent moisture. Do not allow soils to dry out. This plant is a biennial (plants die after producing seed in the second year) that produces foliage in the first year and flowers in the second year. If flower stalks are removed prior to buds opening, the plants may last an additional year or two, but at the cost of loss of ornamental flowering. Plants may be grown from seed and may self-seed in optimum growing conditions if spent flower umbels are not removed. May also be propagated by root cuttings taken in the second year. Space new plants 4-6' apart in the landscape.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Angelica archangelica, commonly called garden angelica, is a bold, somewhat coarse, biennial that may be grown in the garden for both ornamental and culinary purposes. In the first year, it produces a clump of compound leaves. In the second year, a hollow-but-stout stem rises to 6' tall bearing large, ornamentally-attractive, globular flower umbels (each to 6"" diameter). The flowers bloom in early summer, followed by seed that ripens in late summer. Plants die after the seed ripens. The compound, biternate, yellow-green leaves have distinctive inflated stem bases. Lower leaves typically grow to 2-3' long with toothed individual leaflets (to 3"" long). Numerous tiny greenish-white flowers combine to form large, globular, compound umbels (to 6"" diameter). Leaves, stems, roots and seeds (all with a taste of licorice) have been cultivated for many years for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Culinary uses include: (1) leaves may be added to mixed salads; (2) stalks and young shoots may be used like celery or crystallized in sugar for cake decorations or snacks; (3) leaves, seeds and roots may be used for making tea; (4) seed is commercially used for flavoring liqueurs (as Chartreuse). Plants also have a long folk history in Europe and Asia for medicinal uses.Genus name was formerly Herba angelica and so named because an angel pointed out the medicinal qualities of the plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for spider mites, leaf miners and aphids.
","
Garden Uses
This is a large biennial that needs lots of space, some shade, and moist to wet soils. Water gardens, stream/pond banks or wet meadows. Peripheries of borders or herb gardens as long as soil moisture requirements can be met.

Best grown in medium to dry, well-draining soils in full sun, but is adaptable to many soil types including poor, rocky soils and heavy, clay soils. Tolerant of drought, and takes well to pot culture. Occasional but regular summer irrigation may be required in desert landscapes. Hardy from Zones 7 to 10. In the colder parts of its range, this plant will die back to the roots and reemerge in the spring with new top growth. Pruning is not required, but can be pruned for shape in the fall and cut back more severely every few years.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anisacanthus quadrifidus var. wrightii, commonly called Texas firecracker, is an upright, deciduous shrub reaching up to 5' tall and 4' wide with an informal, spreading appearance. It is native to extreme south-central Texas and adjacent northern Mexico, where it is found growing on rocky, calcareous slopes and floodplains. The slender, brittle stems have attractive, peeling bark. The leaves are small, nearly clasping, and lanceolate in shape. Bright red-orange tubular flowers (1-1.5"" long) appear in abundance during bloom periods, which most often fall from spring to late summer after rain. Extremely attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators. Deer tend to avoid this plant.The specific epithet quadrifidus means ""divided into four"", possibly in reference to the four symmetrical petals of the flowers. The infraspecific epithet wrightii honors Charles Wright (1811-1885), an American botanist who chiefly collected  in Texas, Hong Kong, and Cuba.
","
Problems
No known pest or disease issues.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11.  This tree should only be planted outdoors in frost free areas protected from cold winds.  It is best grown in rich, evenly moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates average soils.  It is totally intolerant of frost.  In St. Louis, it may be grown indoors in greenhouses, but is difficult to grow as a houseplant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Annona muricata, commonly called soursop (also known as graviola or guanabana), is a small evergreen tropical tree that is native to Central and tropical South America.  In the wild, it is a slender tree that will grow to 15-20' tall often with down-curved branching.  It grows much smaller in containers.  The name soursop is in reference to its large edible fruits which have a slightly acidic or sour taste.  This tropical plant is not reliably winter hardy to most of southern Florida, but may be grown in the Florida keys and Puerto Rico.  In greenhouses, it typically flowers in summer producing fruits in fall.  Each flower (to 2"" long) appears singly on a woody stalk almost anywhere on the tree (twigs, branches or trunk).  Each flower has three yellowish-green outer petals and three dull yellow inner petals.  Flowers give way to rough-skinned, prickly-textured, oblong fruit (each fruit from 6-12"" long to 4-6"" wide with weight to 8-15 pounds).  Fruit pulp is used in ice cream, sherbets or juices.  Leathery, egg-shaped, malodorous (when bruised), oblong to oval leaves (to 6"" long) are glossy green above.  Plants have been used for various medicinal purposes.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the American Indian (Taino) vernacular name for the cherimoya, soursop or custard-apple.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11.  This tree should only be planted outdoors in frost-free areas protected from cold winds.  It is best grown in rich, evenly moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates average soils.  At best it will survive temperatures that briefly dip to 26-28 degrees F.  This tropical plant is not reliably winter hardy to most of southern Florida, but may be grown in the Florida keys and Puerto Rico.  In St. Louis, it may be grown indoors in greenhouses, but is difficult to grow as a houseplant.  In greenhouses, it typically flowers in summer followed by fruits in fall.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Annona reticulata, commonly called sugar apple, custard apple or bullock's heart, is a small, evergreen to deciduous, tropical tree that is native to the West Indies.  Early on, it was brought to the mainland where it is now cultivated from southern Mexico through Central America to Peru and Brazil.  It typically grows in an upright but sometimes irregular form to 20-35' tall, featuring slender, long-pointed, oblong-lanceolate to lanceolate green leaves (to 4-8"" long).  Leaves are malodorous when bruised.  Leaves may drop in winter near the far northern edge of its growing range (e.g., southern Florida).  Fragrant, yellowish-green flowers (to 1"" long) bloom in spring in small pendant clusters.  Flowers give way to reddish-yellow to brown fruits (to 5""  long) which feature an edible creamy custard-like white flesh.  Each fruit typically weighs 1-2 pounds.  Each fruit is covered in polygonal plates.  Thin fruit skin may be distinctly reticulated (net-veined), hence the specific epithet.  Fruits vary in both size (heart-shaped to globular to irregular) and taste quality (juicy and sweet to hard and mediocre).   This species is generally not cultivated for its fruits. Other genus members that are regularly cultivated for fruit include Annona cherimola (cherimoya), Annona squamosa (sweetsop) and Annona muricata (soursop).Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the American Indian (Taino) vernacular name for the cherimoya, soursop or custard-apple.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this vine is easily grown in humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  This is a subtropical vine that only tolerates brief instances of light frost.  It is evergreen, aggressive and difficult to control in warm frost-free climates (Zones 9-11), but deciduous and less aggressive in climates where winter frost occurs.  Stems will be killed to the ground by hard frosts, but plants will resprout in spring as long as the roots do not freeze over winter.  This vine may be root hardy to as far north as Zone 7, but needs a good winter root mulch.  North of Zone 7, tubers can be dug in fall and brought indoors for overwintering after the above ground vine succumbs to frost but before the tubers freeze.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Plants spread primarily by axillary tubers which drop to the ground to generate new plants.  Tubers in waterways can easily be transported to new locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anredera cordifolia, commonly known as Madeira vine or mignonette vine, is an aggressive succulent climbing perennial vine that can rapidly invade areas in mild, frost-free, subtropical to tropical regions in a manner which smothers, collapses, breaks the branches of, and sometimes kills native  trees and understory plants with the heft and vigor of its vine stems, fleshy leaves, aerial tubers, and lamb’s tail-like sprays of tiny white flowers.  Madeira vine grows from fleshy rhizomes.  It climbs by counterclockwise twining reddish-green stems (no tendrils) to as much as 120’ (10-20’ per year).  Its weight alone is enough to break tree branches, sometimes reducing a tree to a limb-less pole.  When unsupported, it can form thick mats of groundcover that overwhelm low-lying vegetation and inhibit natural regeneration.  It is native to relatively dry sub-tropical areas of South America in Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina, but has over time been cultivated around the world as an ornamental plant.  It was introduced into the U.S. in the early 1800s where it has now naturalized in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and California.  It was introduced into Europe in the early to mid 1800s, with subsequent naturalization occurring in southern Europe from Portugal to Serbia.  In South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii it is considered to be an invasive weed.   It has yet to rise to the level of being seriously invasive in the southern U.S. 

Cordate bright green leaves (to 5” long) are ovate to lanceolate.  Wart-like tubers on aerial stems are often produced in abundance.  Tubers are also produced underground.  Small fragrant creamy white flowers in drooping flower spikes (racemes to 12” long) bloom from the upper leaf axils in late summer to fall (depending on location).  Species plants have both male and female flowers, but they rarely produce seed.  Reddish young stems mature to gray brown.  

This vine is a source of food (edible leaves and tubers).  Leaves may be added to salads or cooked like spinach.  Rhizomatous roots may be cooked like potatoes (not overly tasty however).Genus name derives from the Spanish word enredadera which refers to a twining or climbing plant.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words cordata meaning heart-shaped and folia meaning leaved in reference to the heart-shaped leaves of this plant.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Greenhouse plants are susceptible to spider mites and aphids.

Culture
Best grown in lean, gritty to rocky, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants perform well in dryish soils. They require sharp soil drainage. They will thrive in bright cool summers, but generally dislike the hot and humid summers of the deep South. In optimum growing conditions, plants can spread by stolons to form an attractive ground cover.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Antennaria dioica, commonly called pussytoes, is a stoloniferous, ground-hugging perennial that produces a foliage mat of spatulate, gray-tomentose basal leaves (to 1"" long) rising to only 2-3"" tall but spreading to 18"" wide. Corymbs of tiny white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer on stems rising to 10"" tall. Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with male flowers typically appearing on shorter flower stalks.Genus name comes from the Latin word antenna which means yard of a sailing ship in apparent reference to the bristle-like hairs on the flower heads purportedly resembling the antennae of some insects.Specific epithet means having male and female plants.Each tight flower cluster purportedly resembles the pads or toes of a cat's paw, hence the common name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Difficult plant to grow unless lean, dry, well-drained soil conditions can be met. Poorly-drained soils inevitably lead to root rot.

Culture
Best grown in lean, gritty to rocky, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  This is one of the few native Missouri plants which grows well in dry, shady locations.  It does not do well in fertile, humusy soils, particularly if drainage is poor.  This plant can be somewhat difficult to cultivate well in St. Louis gardens if soil requirements are not met.  In optimum growing conditions, however, it can spread by stolons to form an attractive ground cover.  Plants will typically spread over time to form dense colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Antennaria neglecta, commonly known as field pussytoes, is a small stoloniferous, mat-forming, herbaceous perennial of the composite family.  It is native to dry fields, plains, slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands from Maine to Montana south to Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina.  It is found in all Canadian provinces plus the Northwest Territories, but is absent from the Yukon and Nunavut Territories.  

Stems, leaves and clustered flower heads are woolly.  Leaves are of two kinds: (1) basal leaves (each leaf to 2” long and 1/2” wide) in rosettes, with each leaf having a pointed tip, curved edges, a narrow tapered base and a single vein underneath, and (2) much smaller linear leaves arranged alternately along each flower stalk.  In spring, a flower stalk rises from the center of each basal rosette to 8-12” tall bearing crowded terminal clusters of fuzzy, 1/4-inch wide, white disk flowers (petal-like rays absent) in flower heads which purportedly resemble pussy toes.  Each flower cluster has over 20 small unscented flower heads.  Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants).  Fruits on female plants are seed-like achenes, with the fruiting heads resembling the fruiting heads of miniature dandelions.    

This plant is very similar in appearance to Antennaria plantaginifolia except for being somewhat smaller and sporting narrower single-ribbed basal leaves.  

Field pussytoes is a host for the American painted lady butterfly caterpillar.Genus name comes from the Latin word antenna which means yard of a sailing ship in apparent reference to the bristle-like hairs on the flower heads purportedly resembling the antennae of some insects.Specific epithet from Latin means overlooked or slighted in probable reference to the manner which these plants blend into the landscape.Common name of field pussytoes refers to the common native plant habitat of fields and the purported resemblance of flower clusters to the soft pads of a cat’s paw.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Antennaria parlinii, commonly known as pussytoes, is a native to eastern and central North America.  It is very similar in appearance to Antennaria plantaginifolia, with the main difference being larger flower heads.  It is a stoloniferous, mat-forming plant, with the leaves and flower stalks being woolly and grayish.  Somewhat non-showy, fuzzy, whitish flower heads bloom in spring.  Flowers are crowded into terminal clusters (corymbs) atop downy, small-leaved flowering stems rising to 10” high from a basal rosette of paddle-shaped leaves (to 3” long).  Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with male flowers (yellow stamens) typically appearing on shorter flower stalks than the female flowers (pink stamens).Genus name comes from the Latin word antenna which means yard of a sailing ship in apparent reference to the bristle-like hairs on the flower heads purportedly resembling the antennae of some insects.Commonly called pussytoes because of the supposed resemblance of each tight flower cluster to the soft pads of a cat’s paw.

Culture
Grow in St. Louis as a houseplant. Use a well-drained, peaty potting mixture with a layer of pot shards at the bottom. Plants need bright light (part or diffused sun in summer), but avoid full sun. In too much shade, plants may not bloom. Bright indirect light in winter is best. Consistent moisture year around. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. Does not require winter dormancy. Prefers high humidity. Regular temperatures in summer and minimum 60F in winter. Frequent repotting (every 2 years) helps rid soils of unabsorbed minerals. Sphagnum moss on soil surface helps cover and keep moist any roots that appear. Insecticides may harm flowers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anthurium andraeanum, commonly called flamingo lily or painter’s palette, is native to Columbia and Ecuador. It is an epiphytic evergreen tropical perennial of the Arum family that is most noted for its attractive waxy, palette-shaped, bright red spathes and contrasting dark green foliage. It typically grows to 16” tall. Drooping, heart-shaped, dark green leaves (to 8” long) arise in a clump on long stems from the plant crown and are attractive year around. Each axillary flower (typical arum family) features a creamy yellow spadix enclosed by a large, flat, waxy red spathe (to 6”). Flowers are long-lasting. Flowers may appear throughout the year in optimum growing conditions. Fruits rarely appear on indoor plants.Genus name comes from the Greek words  anthos meaning a flower and oura meaning a tail referring to the tail-like spadix.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for mealybugs, spider mites, white fly or scale. Foliage may scorch in dry or drafty locations. Rots, blight and leaf spot may occur.
","
Garden Uses
Houseplant for bright, humid areas. Popular cut flower.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Antigonon leptopus, commonly called coral vine, native to Mexico. It is a tuberous-rooted, tendril-climbing tropical vine that rapidly grows to 40’ in its native habitat. As an annual in the St. Louis area, it more typically grows to 8-10’ in a single season. Flowers in axillary racemes feature pink to white sepals. Blooms late summer to fall. Coarse, wavy-edged, arrowhead-shaped green leaves (to 4” long). Numerous additional descriptive common names, including confederate vine, Mexican creeper, chain of love, love vine, pink vine, corallita and Queen’s wreath.Genus name comes from the Greek words anti meaning in place of and polygonon a knotweed. It is in the knotweed family.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Caterpillars may chew on the foliage. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Annual vine for trellises, arbors or fences. Containers. Greenhouses.

Culture
Short-lived tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10. In St. Louis, it is usually grown as an annual. It is easily grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid overhead watering. Start seeds indoors 6-10 weeks before last frost date or purchase starter plants. Set out plants/seedlings after last frost date. Pinch stem tips of young plants to promote bushiness and prevent leggy growth. Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom. If flowering slows drastically after the first flush of bloom, consider cutting plants back hard and fertilizing. Although well-mulched plants in protected locations may overwinter in St. Louis and although cuttings may be taken in fall for overwintering, snapdragons are inexpensive plants that are perhaps best repurchased each spring. Nurseries commonly sell plants in cell/six packs. Always purchase fungal resistant plants/seeds. Snapdragons, like pansies, are often planted in fall south of USDA Zone 7 where they will not only survive the winter, but will bloom as long as temperatures stay above freezing.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Antirrhinum majus, commonly called snapdragon, is an old garden favorites that, in optimum cool summer growing conditions, will flower well from spring to fall. In climates with protracted hot summer weather, plants often tend to languish and may not last the entire growing season. The common name is in reference to the dragon-shaped, tubular, two-lipped, closed flowers that appear in terminal racemes. Many cultivars and hybrids in which A. majus is a prominent parent are available in commerce. Flowers come in a variety of both pastel shades and bright colors, including some bicolors, in shades of white, yellow, red, pink, orange, peach and purple. Lance shaped, glossy dark green leaves (to 3” long). Cultivars and hybrids generally are classified into three groups based upon height: dwarf plants (8-12” tall), intermediate plants (12-24” tall) and tall plants (24-36” tall).Genus name comes from the Greek words anti meaning like and  rhis meaning a nose or snout in allusion to the appearance of the flower which looks like a dragon's snout.
","
Problems
Rust can be a significant problem. If rust does appear in a planting, it is best to grow snapdragons in another part of the garden the following year. Also susceptible to mold, fungal leaf spots, downy mildew, wilt and root rots. Watch for aphids. Tall plants may need support when young until such time as they bush out.
","
Garden Uses
Dwarf varieties are best for beds, border fronts, edgings, window boxes and other containers. Intermediate varieties are best for bedding and mixed borders. Tall plants are best for borders and cutting gardens.

Culture
Celery is a cool-weather vegetable that dislikes the heat and humidity of a typical St. Louis summer.  Best growing season temperatures fall within the range of 60-75 degrees F.  It tends to bolt if exposed to temperatures of 55 degrees F. or less for continuous periods of 1-2 weeks (cover plants at night if this problem occurs).  This plant is difficult to grow well.  It requires a moist, rich, well-drained soil in full sun with regular fertilization and consistent watering.  Mulch helps soils retain moisture while discouraging weed growth.  Start seed indoors about 10 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  Starter plants should be set out in the garden about 12-15"" apart after last spring frost date.  Celery generally requires a rich, well-drained soil in full sun.  Stalks are ready to harvest after 3-4 months.  If blanching is to be done, the celery bed should be sited in a location where covering to eliminate light can be easily done.  For blanching, build a frame over the bed in fall and cover with paper that totally blocks light.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Apium graveolens is a biennial to perennial herb that is reportedly native to temperate Mediterranean climates in Europe, Asia and Africa.  Wild plants typically grow to 24-36"" tall and to 12-18"" wide with aromatic pinnately divided leaves.  In biennial form, the plant forms a basal rosette of leaves in the first year followed in the second year by a summer bloom of off-white flowers in umbels.  Plants may naturalize in the landscape through self-seeding.  Apium graveolens is the progenitor of two different vegetable crops:  (1) Celery (Apium graveolens var. dulce) which is grown for its edible crisp leaf stalks and leaves and (2) Celery root or Celeriac (Apium graveolens var. rapaceum) which is grown for its edible, enlarged, turnip-like roots.  

Var. dulce (celery) is grown as an annual in the garden for production of its crisp edible leaf stalks.  It typically rises to 30"" tall.  Harvest may begin when the outer stalks reach 6-8"" tall (heart of plant continues to grow).  All stalks should be harvested prior to the first significant fall frost.  Plants may escape gardens and naturalize (revert from var. dulce) in various parts of the U. S., particularly in the southwestern States.  Celery is considered to be an invasive spreader in some areas.Genus name from Latin means bee (bees are reportedly attracted to the white flowers of the plant).
","
Problems
Aphids, earwigs, nematodes, celery worms and slugs.  Root rot may develop in overly wet soils.  Early blight and late blight can cause significant problem in some areas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Apocynum cannabinum is a bushy member of the dogbane and milkweed family that features opposite, lance-shaped leaves on upright, stiff stems with terminal clusters of very tiny, whitish flowers that bloom in summer. All parts of this dogbane exude a milky juice when bruised. Although this plant is considered toxic to humans (and the bane of dogs), the roots were commonly harvested in the 19th and early 20th centuries for a variety of folk medicine and medical purposes. A Missouri native that typically grows in the wild in dry rocky or open woods, glades and prairies. Stems are fibrous (cannabinum meaning hemp) and were once used to make rope. Very attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name for this or a related plant. Believed to be poisonous to dogs.Specific epithet means like Cannabis or hemp.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Because of its aggressive spreading growth habit it should be grown in areas where it will not crowd out other garden perennials.
","
Garden Uses
A good plant to naturalize in a butterfly garden, native plant garden or wild garden.

Culture
In the St. Louis area, this aquatic perennial is best grown in relatively shallow areas of small ponds or water gardens where the water level is from 6-24” deep or in greenhouses. It may be grown in either the bottom mud or in containers placed on the bottom. This plant thrives in cool waters of 70F or less. When grown in warm winter climates (e.g., USDA Zone 9-10), plants will flower from fall to spring but go dormant in the heat of the summer. In colder winter climates, plants typically flower in summer and early fall, but die back in winter or must be brought indoors. Plants are perhaps best propagated from seed because the tubers can be difficult to divide. The seed must be kept in a wet medium (e.g., moss) from harvesting to planting. Seed is best planted as soon as it is matures in containers submerged in 3” of water. Use fertile loams with 1/ 2” sand sprinkled on top. Seed can also germinate directly on the water surface. In St. Louis (USDA Zone 6), plants may survive outdoors in winter if grown in protected water bodies where the water does not freeze over the crown. Plant containers may be brought inside for overwintering in a greenhouse or sunporch. In warm winter climates, plants can spread through self-seeding unless spent flowers are promptly removed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aponogeton distachyos, commonly called cape pondweed, is a water lily-like plant that produces floating leaves and fragrant flowers from tubers growing at the bottom of water bodies. It is native to frost free areas of South Africa where it typically blooms in small ponds from fall to spring and then goes dormant in summer as the temperatures rise and the ponds dry up. In St. Louis, it will grow in full sun to part shade and appreciates a good loamy soil. Oblong leaves (to 3-6” long) lie flat on the water surface. Sweetly scented white flowers rise above the surface usually in the cooler months. Flowers reportedly have a hawthorn-like fragrance, hence the additional common name of water hawthorn. In South Africa, this plant is commercially grown for its edible tubers that may be added to stews.Genus comes from the Latin name of the healing springs at Aquae Aponi (now Bagni d'Abano) in Italy plus geiton meaning a neighbor. Later transferred to the tropical genus.Specific epithet means with two spikes.

Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Wide range of soil tolerance as long as drainage is good. Prefers rich, moist soils in light to moderate shade. Freely self-seeds and will naturalize to form large colonies in optimum growing conditions. Remove flowering stems after bloom to encourage additional bloom. Keep soils uniformly moist after bloom to prolong attractive foliage appearance. When foliage depreciates, plants may be cut to the ground.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aquilegia canadensis is a Missouri native spring wildflower which occurs in rocky woods, slopes, ledges and open areas throughout the State. Features drooping, bell-like, 1-2"", red and yellow flowers (red sepals, yellow-limbed petals, 5 distinctive red spurs and a mass of bushy yellow stamens). Delicate, biternate foliage is somewhat suggestive of meadow rue (Thalictrum) and remains attractive throughout the summer as long as soils are kept moist. Flowers are quite attractive to hummingbirds.Genus name comes from the Latin word for eagle in reference to the flower’s five spurs which purportedly resemble an eagle’s talon.Specific epithet means of Canada or also of north-eastern North America.
","
Problems
This species has very good resistance to leaf miner which often causes severe damage to the foliage of many other columbine species and hybrids.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, moist, sandy loams in light to moderate shade.  Generally tolerates a wide range of soils as long as they are well-drained.  Add sand to clay soils to improve drainage.  This species tolerates heat and sun better than most other species in the genus, however.  Remove flowering stems after bloom to encourage additional bloom. Keep soils uniformly moist after bloom to prolong attractive foliage appearance. When foliage depreciates, plants may be cut to the ground.  Reseeds well in optimum growing conditions as long as flowers are not deadheaded.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aquilegia chrysantha, commonly known as golden columbine, canary columbine or southwestern yellow columbine, is a bushy, clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall.  It is native to canyons in damp places from western Texas, southern New Mexico, southern Utah, and Arizona south into northern Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon), with a disjunct population in southern Colorado (Colorado plants have shorter spurs and are sometimes called Aquilegia chrysantha var. rydbergii).  

Large bright yellow flowers (each to 3” long) bloom in early spring (March-early May).  Each flower (to 3” long) has (a) five petals, with each petal having a short tube in front and a very distinctive, slender, tapered, downward-pointing, backward-projecting, straight to outward-curving spur, and (b) five pointed petaloid sepals which are longer than the blades of the petals but are lighter yellow in color.  Flowers have a slight fragrance.  Because of its unusually long spurs (to 3”), this species is frequently used as a parent in the hybridization of long-spurred hybrid columbines.  Compound palmate basal leaves are mostly 3-ternate.  

Golden columbine is a loose grower, but usually does not need support if given regular moisture during the growing season.

Var. hinckleyana is endemic only to Capote Falls, Sierra Vieja Mountains, Presidio County, Texas.  It differs from the species by being a more compact plant (to 18-30” tall) whose flowers have much shorter spurs (to only 1 1/4” long).  Basal green foliage with a bluish tinge is somewhat suggestive of meadow rue (Thalictrum).  Unlike the species, this variety typically has 2-ternate leaves.  It is synonymous with and sometimes sold by nurseries as Aquiligia hinckleyana.Genus name comes from the Latin word for eagle in reference to the flower’s five spurs which purportedly resemble an eagle’s talon.Specific epithet means with golden flowers.
","
Problems
Crown rot in poorly drained soils.  Less susceptible to leaf miner than many of the other species of columbine.  Spider mites and aphids may appear in hot and dry conditions.   Plants may show stress and lose leaves when planted in too much sun in hot summer conditions.  Foliage usually declines by mid-summer at which point it should be cut to the ground.
","
Garden Uses
Borders, cottage gardens, open shade gardens or naturalized areas.   Also a good selection for a hummingbird garden.  Rock gardens.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aquilegia flabellate, commonly known as fan columbine, is a compact perennial that typically grows in a mound to only 8-18” tall with a spread to 12”.  It is native to eastern Asia (Japan and Korea).  Flowers (each to 2” wide) feature nodding lilac blue to purple-blue sepals and creamy white petals with short incurved spurs (to 1” long).  Flowers bloom in spring (April-May).  Compound leaves with overlapping, rounded, fan-shaped, blue green leaf segments are 2 to 3 ternate.  Leaf segments are thicker and have more blue coloration than is found on the leaf segments of most other species in the genus.Genus name comes from the Latin word for eagle in reference to the flower’s five spurs which purportedly resemble an eagle’s talon.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word flabellatus mean fanlike in reference to leaflet shape.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to leaf miner.  Watch for columbine borer.  Foliage usually declines by mid-summer at which point it should be cut to the ground.
","
Garden Uses
Compact shape makes this one of the better columbines for rock gardens.  Also good in borders, cottage gardens, open shade gardens or naturalized areas.  Can be effective in the sun-dappled areas of woodland gardens.  Continue to water plants after bloom to enjoy the ground cover effect of the attractive foliage.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aquilegia vulgaris knows as columbine (also commonly called European crowfoot and granny's bonnet) is native to Europe. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of eastern North America. It is a bushy, clump-forming perennial that typically grows in a mound of thin, branching, leafy stems to 1.5-3' tall. It is noted for its spring bloom (April-May in St. Louis) of blue to violet flowers with spreading sepals and short-hooked spurs. Biternate, medium green, basal leaves are glabrous above and glaucous beneath. Upper leaves are divided into lobed leaflets that are usually three-lobed at the tips. Many different cultivars are available in commerce, featuring flowers that are single or double and short-spurred or spurless, in a variety of colors ranging from blue to violet to white to pink to red.Genus name comes from the Latin word for eagle in reference to the flower’s five spurs which purportedly resemble an eagle’s talon.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning common.Columbine comes from the Latin word columba meaning dove-like. Common name of granny's bonnet is in reference to the spreading bonnet-like appearance of the flower petals.

Culture
Best grown in areas with long warm summers.  Generally will not produce a good crop of peanuts north of Virginia.  Plant seeds in spring after ground has warmed.  Best grown in well-composted, fertile, light-textured, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Add calcium as needed to the top 3-4” of soil.  Do not allow soils to dry out.  Plant seeds (peanuts) about 2” deep in rows about 3 feet apart with 6-9” between each plant in the row.  After first fall frost, plants are dug up, freed of soil and spread on a dry surface not touching the ground (sometimes plants are simply dug up and inverted on the ground) to cure before stripping the pods from the plants.  Pods typically ripen 120-150 days after seed is planted.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arachis hypogaea, commonly known as peanut, is an herbaceous perennial that is raised as an annual.  It typically grows in a single season to 10-20” tall and as wide.  It somewhat resembles in appearance a small sweet pea bush.  It is primarily grown as an agricultural crop for harvest of peanuts which have become a favorite food consumed world-wide by humans (raw nuts, peanut butter, oils and confections).  Plants are native to South America.  

Opposite pinnate leaves have an even number of leaflets (each leaf usually has two opposite pairs with no terminal leaflet).  Each leaflet is ovate-rounded to 2 1/2” long and 1” across.  Pea-like orange-veined yellow flowers (to 1 5/8”) appear solitary or in small axillary clusters.  Flowers bloom from July to September.  After pollination of a flower, the flower stem elongates and dips until the ovary reaches the ground, at which point continued growth pushes the ovary into the ground where the fruit (peanut) develops into a legume seed pod, each pod to 3” long and containing 1-4 seeds.  Unlike other legumes such as peas or beans, peanut pods do not split open when ripe to release seeds.  From a botanical standpoint, peanuts are legumes not nuts.  However, in most cases peanuts are served for human consumption as if they were nuts.  

Plants are commercially grown in the southeastern U.S. from Virginia to Florida and Texas, but have been introduced further north to Missouri, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.   

Peanut was primarily used as animal feed stock until the 1930s.  George Washington Carver helped develop the peanut while employed at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.    USDA encouraged cotton farmers in the southeastern U.S. to grow peanuts as an alternative to or in addition to growing cotton, in part because cotton depletes nitrogen from the soil but peanuts add nitrogen to the soils (nitrogen fixing).

Commercially, China produces about 42% of the overall world production followed by India at 12% and the USA at 8%.Genus name comes from Arachidna for a clover with recurving, subterranean, fruiting heads.Specific epithet means under the earth in reference to the subterranean development of peanut pods.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Peanuts are particularly susceptible to contamination during growth and storage.  Poor storage can lead to infection by mold fungus Aspergillus flavus.
","
Garden Uses
Peanuts are typically not grown in gardens as ornamental plants.   Peanuts serve not only as a favorite food product for humans, but also are commercially used in the production of a number of non-food items such as textile materials, cosmetics, plastics, dyes and paints.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in moist, acidic, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Best with constant and even soil moisture.  This fern may survive winters in Zone 6, but often with a somewhat bedraggled appearance combined with considerable loss of evergreen color.  Grow in protected locations in the northern parts of the growing range in order to help protect the evergreen foliage.  Morning sun often works well, but afternoon sun is usually too much in hot summer climates. This fern spreads by creeping rhizomes to form a clump.  It is easily propagated from rootball divisions.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Arachniodes simplicior, commonly known as East Indian holly fern or shield fern, is a rhizomatous evergreen fern with bipinnate, ovate-triangular fronds.  It typically grows to 1-2’ tall and to 1-3’ wide.  It is native to woodland streambanks, crevices in cliffs, wet rocks, thickets, and open forested areas in China and Japan.  It was introduced into South Carolina where it subsequently naturalized to form a stable population.

Arachniodes aristata and Aspidium aristatum var. simplicius are synonyms.Genus name comes from the Greek word arachne meaning a spider in reference to the spidery aspect of the clusters of spore capsules.Specific epithet from Latin mean simple or unbranched.Common name of holly fern is in reference to this fern’s stiff, waxy, evergreen fronds which some contend resemble holly.‘Variegata’ is a variegated form which features glossy, lime green fronds with deeply divided subdivisions, showcased by a showy soft yellow stripe down the midrib of each pinnule (lance-shaped leaflet).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aralia chinensis, commonly known as Chinese angelica tree, is a deciduous, suckering, spiny-stemmed small tree or large shrub that typically grows to 12-20’ (less frequently to 30’) tall.  In home gardens, it is more often seen as a large shrub growing to 15’ tall.  It is native to woodland stream banks and slopes in China.  

Huge showy bi-pinnate compound leaves (each leaf to 3’ long and 2’ wide) form a shrub-covering canopy of foliage.  Each leaf contains ovate to broad-ovate pale gray-green leaflets (5-13 leaflets per pinna) which turn yellow in fall.  Small off-white flowers bloom in large inflorescences in late summer to autumn.  Each inflorescence is a terminal panicle of umbels, with each umbel having 20-50 tiny flowers (to 1/8” across).  Flowers are attractive to bees.  Flowers are followed by clusters of fleshy, spherical, dark purple-black drupes which ripen in fall.  Drupes are attractive to birds.  

Some botanists classify this shrub/tree as a form of Aralia elata from which it is primarily distinguished by the elongated main axis in its inflorescence and its shorter stalked leaflets.Genus name comes from the Latinization of the old French-Canadian name of aralie.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning elevated.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to leaf spots.  Aphids and mealy bugs may appear.  Handling bark and roots may cause allergic skin reactions.
","
Garden Uses
Best utilized in infrequently traveled areas where contact with the spiny plant stems will be less likely to occur.  Plants can appear coarse in winter, but the compound foliage, late-summer flowers, black fruit and general plant habit lend diversity and ornamental interest during the growing season.  This is a good plant for shrub borders, woodland margins and remote areas of the landscape where it can be allowed to spread.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aralia cordata, commonly known as Japanese spikenard, mountain asparagus or udo, is a thornless, rhizomatous, herbaceous perennial that typically grows somewhat rapidly to 3-6’ tall and as wide in a single season.  It is native to shady parts of forested areas and grassy slopes in Japan, Korea and east-central to southern China.  

Compound leaves (to 3’ long) are 2-3 pinnate with 3-7 coarse, finely toothed, cordate-based, ovate leaflets (each to 6” long) per pinna.  Inflorescence consists of white flowers in umbels arranged in large terminal and axillary spike-like panicles (to 1 1/2’ long).  Flowers bloom from late summer to early fall (late July –September).

Young shoots of this plant are considered a culinary delicacy in Japan (taste resembling that of asparagus) where they are cultivated in underground tunnels.  White fleshy roots (elongate cylindric rhizomes) are eaten as one would consume a parsnip.  Udo leaves may be eaten as a vegetable when young.Genus name comes from the Latinization of the old French-Canadian name of aralie.Specific epithet from Latin means heart-shaped in reference to the plant leaflets.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aralia elata commonly called angelica tree, is sometimes seen in the wild as a small upright tree growing to 20-40' tall. In home gardens, it is more often seen as a large shrub growing to 12-18' tall. It is noted for producing spiny, pithy, usually unbranched stems which are crowned at the top with a spreading umbrella-like canopy of huge, showy, bi-pinnate leaves (each to 2-4' long). Regardless of form, this is a rapid growing tree or shrub that contributes unique ornamental interest to the landscape. One leaf may contain as many 80+ ovate to elliptic leaflets (each to 3-4"" long). Leaflets are medium to dark green with irregularly toothed margins. Foliage turns pale yellow to reddish purple in fall. Small, 5-petaled, white flowers (to 1/8” across) bloom in large, terminal, umbellose panicles (to 18” long) in late summer (August). Flowers are quite showy and very attractive to bees. Flowers are followed by clusters of fleshy, spherical, black drupes that ripen from late summer into fall. Drupes are quite attractive to birds. Angelica tree is native to Japan, eastern Siberia, Korea and northeastern China. It is very similar in appearance to U.S. native Aralia spinosa, except this Asian species may grow taller, has more pubescence on leaf undersides and has better winter hardiness (Michael Dirr).Genus name comes from the Latinization of the old French-Canadian name of aralie.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning elevated.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aralia racemosa, commonly called American spikenard, is a rhizomatous, shrubby-looking, soft-stemmed, herbaceous perennial of the Ginseng family that is native to moist rich woods from Quebec to Manitoba south to Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Georgia.  In Missouri, it is typically found on wooded slopes and ravines, shaded moist ledges, and bluffs in the northern and eastern parts of the State and in the Ozark Mountains, but is absent from the unglaciated prairie regions in west central and southwestern Missouri south of the Missouri River (Steyermark). 

Glabrous, freely branching, dark maroon to near black stems rise from large aromatic roots to 3-5' tall (infrequently to 10') bearing few but very large 2-3 pinnate compound leaves (to 2 1/2' long) each of which is divided and subdivided into 9-21 coarse oval-rounded leaflets (each to 2-6"" long) with toothed margins, cordate bases and pointed tips.  Small but numerous umbels of tiny greenish-white flowers (to 1/8"" across) bloom in long upright terminal but sometimes axillary panicles (each to 12-18"" long) in early to mid-summer (June to August).  Flowers are followed by dense hanging clusters of basically inedible berries (drupes to 1/4"" diameter) which mature to dark purple.  Berries are attractive to birds.  Thick roots have been used to flavor teas and as an ingredient in root beer.  A poultice made from the roots was formerly used for a variety of medicinal purposes including treatment of infections, burns, skin irritations, ulcers, and swellings.Genus name comes from the Latinization of the old French-Canadian name of aralie.Specific epithet from the Latin word racemosus meaning flowers in racemes.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aralia spinosa, commonly called devil’s walking stick or Hercules club, gets its common name from the stout, sharp spines found on its leaf stalks, stems and branches. This is a large, upright, suckering, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 10-15’ tall, but infrequently grows as a small flat topped tree to as much as 35’ tall. It is native to Missouri where it typically occurs in low upland woods, thickets, wooded slopes, bluffs and ravines in several counties in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark). In other parts of its native range in the eastern U.S., it is commonly found in wood margins, fields and pastures. Interesting compound foliage, late summer flowers, juicy black fruit and spiny stems give this shrub distinctive and unique ornamental interest. Sparse, upright, mostly unbranched, club-like branches, ringed with conspicuous leaf scars and spines, are typically naked at the bottom but crowned at the top by umbrella-like canopies of huge compound leaves. Alternate, bipinnate to tripinnate, medium to dark green leaves grow 2-5 feet long and 2-4 feet wide, with individual leaflets (2-4” long) having toothed margins. Foliage turns pale yellow to dull purple brown in fall. Small, 5-petaled, white flowers (to 1/8” across) bloom in huge, terminal, umbellose panicles (to 24” long) in July–August. Flowers are quite showy and very attractive to bees. Flowers are followed by clusters of fleshy, spherical, black drupes that ripen in late August-October. Drupes are quite attractive to birds.Genus name comes from the Latinization of the old French-Canadian name of aralie.Specific epithet means spiny.Additional common names for this plant include angelica tree and prickly ash.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Araucaria araucana, commonly called monkey puzzle tree or Chilian pine, is an evergreen conifer that is native to woodland volcanic slopes up to 6,000 feet in elevation in the Andes Mountains in Chile and Argentina. It is the national tree of Chile. It reportedly has the best winter hardiness of any tree native to areas in the world south of the equator. It typically grows to 20-30' tall in cultivation, but may reach 90-130' tall in its native habitat. It is noted for its unique shape. Trees are loose-pyramidal and open when young, but develop an umbrella-like crown with loss of lower branches as they age. Horizontal, upward-arching branches appear in whorls around the trunk with rope-like branchlets. Bark is gray-brown and ridged. Dense, leathery, triangular, radially-arranged leaves (to 2"" long) have sharp points. Individual leaves persist for 10 to 15 years. Trees are dioecious (separate male and female trees). Female cones (to 6"" long) take 2-3 years to mature, disintegrating at maturity to release the nut-like seeds (each to 1 1/2"" long). Seeds (pinones) are edible and reminiscent of pine nuts. The tree is endangered in Chile today and is now protected under Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).Genus name comes from the Araucanian Indians of central Chile to whose territory Araucaria is native.Specific epithet is in reference to the Araucanian people who are native to Chile. Arauco is a Province of southern Chile.Common name reportedly comes from a comment made in England in the mid-1800s where an observer of a specimen tree growing in Cornwall remarked that it would puzzle a monkey to climb that tree.

Noteworthy Characteristics
New Caledonian pine is native to New Caledonia where it was discovered by Captain Cook on his second voyage.  It is also commonly called Cook pine.  This tree has a narrow columnar form (hence the specific epithet) and will mature over time to 100-200' tall.   Tree trunks are often distinctively curved near the base before correcting to an upright form.  Brown scaly bark is rough and peels in strips.  Branches are numerous, short, mostly horizontal and located in whorls around the trunk.  Juvenile leaves are awl-shaped (to 1/2"" long).  Adult leaves are lanceolate-ovate to triangular (to 1/4"" long) and overlapping.  Female seed cones (to 4-5"" long) are upright, scaly, egg-shaped and  located in the upper branches.  Male cones (to 2-3"" long) are drooping, scaly, cylindrical and hang from the lower branches.  Mature tree is basically very narrow with a spire-like crown.  Young trees (those with juvenile foliage - typically under 25' tall) are almost indistinguishable from Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) which is native to Norfolk Island off the coast of Australia.   With age, New Caledonian pine develops a much thinner and more columnar appearance than Norfolk Island pine which is pyramidal.   New Caledonian pine is commonly planted throughout the Hawaiian Islands.Genus name comes from the Araucanian Indians of central Chile to whose territory Araucaria is native.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. When grown outdoors, this tree prefers deep, porous, moderately fertile, reasonably moist soils in full sun.  Tolerant of some dry soil conditions however.   Also tolerant of windy conditions.   May be grown from seed sown in moist, sandy, peaty soils, but seed-grown trees typically have widely-spaced tiers of leaves that are less ornamentally attractive than the leaves found on trees raised from terminal cuttings.  Best growth generally occurs in sub-tropical regions.  

For indoor use, this tree may be grown in containers or tubs in fertile, porous, sandy, peaty, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in fairly cool conditions (55-65 degrees F).  Full sun is normally best for developing compact symmetrical growth, but some light afternoon shade may be needed to avoid possible foliage bleach (yellow tints).  As a houseplant, it will generally adapt to the warm, dry atmosphere found in most offices and homes.  Consider weekly or biweekly applications of dilute liquid fertilizer from spring through fall.  Avoid soils that are too wet or too dry.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Norfolk Island pine is a pyramidal to columnar, coniferous, evergreen tree with a symmetrical form that features whorled, horizontal branches (typically 5 branches per whorl) in tiers radiating outward from a strong, single, upright trunk.  Secondary branches in two rows spread horizontally or droop slightly.  It is native to Norfolk Island off the coast of Australia where it typically grows on basalt sea cliffs and interior rain forests, sometimes reaching majestic heights of 200’ or more with trunk diameters to 6’ or more.  It was discovered on Captain Cook’s second voyage (1772-1775), and was subsequently introduced into cultivation in 1793.  It is now widely planted throughout the world in subtropical regions, often in coastal areas.  It is common in Hawaii, parts of southern Florida and parts of southern California up the coast to the San Francisco Bay area. 

Needle-like, awl-shaped juvenile leaves (each to 1/2” long) have incurved sharp-pointed ends.  Scale-like adult leaves (each to 1/4” long) are lanceolate to ovate-triangular, overlap each other and are closely arranged along the shoots pointing toward the shoot ends.  Cylindrical male pollen cones grow to 2” long.  Nearly globular, spiny-scaled, female seed cones grow to 3-6” in diameter. 

Norfolk Island Pine is now the most popular species in the genus in North America where it is commonly grown in pots and tubs as a decorative indoor plant. 

In St. Louis, it is grown as a container/tub plant, typically in the 3-6’ tall range.  It grows slowly, and in proper growing conditions has a long life.  It looks like a pine with horizontal needle-like branches, but it is not part of the pine genus.Genus name comes from the Araucanian Indians of central Chile to whose territory Araucaria is native.Specific epithet comes from Greek meaning variously leaved.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Arbutus unedo, commonly called strawberry tree, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that is native from the Mediterranean to Ireland.  It typically grows in a multi-stemmed form, but can be trained as a single trunk tree.  It matures to 10-15' tall but infrequently grows to as much as 30' tall.  Mature trunks and branches are covered with grayish-brown bark which peels and flakes to reveal an attractive reddish-brown inner bark.   Urn-shaped, aromatic, pinkish-white flowers in drooping panicles (to 2"" long) bloom in October, with bloom often continuing until January.  Long-stemmed, spherical, green fruits (to 1""diameter) appear in winter after the flowers, but take almost a full year to ripen.  As new white flowers begin to bloom in October, the fruits from the preceding winter ripen to strawberry red, leaving the plant with the unusual situation of having both attractive flowers and ripe fruit at the same time.  Although the ripe fruits (each to 3/4"" in diameter) have the same color as strawberries, they unfortunately do not have the same flavor as strawberries (exceedingly bland).  Glossy, leathery, obovate, dark green leaves (to 4"" long) have red stems and serrate margins.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this plant.The specific epithet undedo is a combination of the Latin words unum meaning one and edo meaning eat resulting in ""I eat one"" in reference to the edible (but unpalatable) fruit.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Flowers and fruit may be damaged in cold winter conditions.   Aphids may appear.  Watch for fungal leaf spot.

Culture
Grow in acidic, dry to medium, well-drained, sandy or gritty soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Usually grows well in poor infertile soils.  Plants should not be fertilized. Drought tolerant once established.  Likes exposed open sites.  Best grown in USDA Zones 2-6 (7).  Grows poorly in hot and humid summer climates, and is not recommended for planting in most areas south of USDA Zone 7.  Difficult to transplant from the wild.  Propagate by cuttings from the current season’s growth, by layering, by division (with care because roots dislike disturbance) or species plants by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, known by a large number of common names including common bearberry and kinninnick, is an extremely winter hardy, creeping, slow-growing, prostrate, woody evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-12” tall but spreads over time by flexible branching (roots at the nodes) to 3-6’ wide or more. This is a circumpolar ground-hugger which is native throughout the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia.  In North America, it is typically found in a variety of locations from Alaska to Newfoundland south through Canada to Virginia, Illinois, South Dakota, New Mexico and central California in a variety of habitats typically including gravelly and/or sandy exposed sites, dry/rocky slopes/outcrops, forest margins and forest clearings.  It is primarily confined to cool alpine regions in the more southern parts of its growing range (Appalachians in Virginia, Rockies in New Mexico and Sierras in California).  

Branchlets mature to reddish brown, with papery peeling bark on older twigs.  Branchlets are clad with alternate, entire, short-stalked, leathery, rounded-at-the-tip, obovate to spatulate, evergreen dark green leaves (each to 1 1/4” long) which are shiny above but paler beneath.  Leaves turn bronze in winter before becoming green again in spring.  Miniature, drooping, urn-shaped, white-to-pink flowers (to 1/4” long) in small terminal clusters bloom in April to May.  Rounded, berry-like fruits (drupes) ripen in August-September.   Each drupe (1/2” long) contains 5 nutlets (seeds).  Drupes are green in summer ripening to red in fall, sometimes remaining on the plants throughout winter.  Drupes are bittersweet raw off the plant, but sweeter when first boiled.  Fruits are technically edible for humans, but are generally considered to be mealy and lacking flavor.  Meriwether Lewis described these fruits in 1806 to be “tasteless and insipid.”  On the plus side, bears, birds and small mammals love the fruits.Genus name comes from the Greek words arctos meaning bear and staphyle meaning bunch of grapes in reference to the fruits (often in grape-like clusters) which are commonly eaten by bears.The specific epithet comes from the Latin words uva meaning grape and ursus meaning bear thus bear’s grape, also in reference to the fruits serving in the wild as bear food.  Bearberry nickname means the same thing, namely, that bears eat the fruits of this plant.One of the popular common names for this plant is kinnikinnick which is an Algonquin word meaning smoking mixture.  Native Americans and later early pioneers sometimes smoked the dried leaves of bearberry (alone or mixed with other leaves, tobacco and/or the dry inner bark of red osier dogwood) in pipes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  If grown in poorly-drained sites or in climates hotter than preferred, this bearberry becomes more susceptible to certain diseases such as root rot, black mildew, leaf gall, leaf spot and rust.
","
Garden Uses
Moderate to large scale ground cover with year round interest.  Helps control soil erosion on slopes and hillsides.  Effective when grown around shrubs, along sunny border margins, in naturalized areas and in native plant gardens.  Herb gardens.  Drape over a wall.  Rock gardens.  

Teas have been made from certain plant parts (leaves, stems and roots) for a variety of medicinal purposes (antiseptic, astringent and diuretic).  Leaves are rich in tannins and have been used in the process of tanning hides/leather.  Sprigs of green leaves with red berries may be used as Christmas decorations.

Freely self-seeds to the point where it has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and the Hawaiian Islands.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ardisia crenata, commonly known as coralberry, is a compact evergreen shrub that is native to forest understories from Japan to Southeast Asia and northern India.  It typically grows to 4-5' tall and as wide.  Alternate, glossy, thick, elliptic-lanceolate, dark green leaves (to 4-8"" long) with crenate to undulate  margins and reddish petioles are evergreen.   Small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers (to 1/4"" long) bloom in late spring to early summer.  Flowers are followed by shiny, coral (hence the common name) to scarlet red fruits (fleshy one-seeded drupes) which often remain on the plant year round.  Fruits eventually fall to the ground around the parent plant, usually resulting in growth of a number of seedlings around the parent.   Fruit-consuming birds help distribute the seeds to additional locations.  High seed germination rate often translates into a weedy (sometimes invasive) spread of this plant, particularly into mesic forest areas where an undesired reduction in native species begins to occur.Genus name comes from the Greek aradis meaning a point in reference to the pointed anthers of these flowering trees and shrubs.Specific epithet means crenate (with rounded teeth) in reference to leaf margins.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Group in shrub borders, shade gardens or woodland areas.  Also effective in naturalized areas where possible colonial spread is not a concern.  May be grown as a houseplant in containers that are overwintered indoors.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is easily grown in moist, acidic, organically rich soils in part shade to full shade.  It thrives in moderately wet soil conditions.  Foliage may burn in full sun locations.  Often spreads aggressively in the landscape by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ardisia elliptica, commonly known as shoebutton ardisia or duck’s-eyes, is a tropical to semi-tropical broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows in understory thickets to 10-16’ tall and as wide.  It is native to the western coast of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Philippines, but has been widely introduced and cultivated as an ornamental in warm locations throughout the world, with naturalization occurring in such places as Puerto Rico, some Caribbean islands, tropical Australia, several islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans including the State of Hawaii, and in southern Florida.  

Shoebutton ardisia features (a) alternate, flat-margined, smooth and leathery, oblanceolate to obovate, evergreen leaves (to 6” long) with pointed tips and wedge-shaped bases, (b) star-shaped, axillary, light pink to pale violet flowers (to 1/2” long) which bloom in conspicuous umbellate inflorescences, often sporadically throughout the year, and (c) rounded, berry-like drupes which emerge white, develop to red, but finally ripen to a deep purple-black.  Flowers have chambered anthers (not present in any other species of Aridisia), but a microscope is needed to confirm this.  

Unfortunately, shoebutton ardisia tends to be invasive in some habitats, including southern Florida where it is now listed as a noxious weed.  Seeds are typically disbursed by birds and small mammals.  Southern Florida growing sites include mangrove and cypress stands, hammocks, marshes, fallow fields and altered wet lands where plants frequently form monotypic thickets which crowd out native plants.Genus name comes from the Greek aradis meaning a point in reference to the pointed anthers of these flowering trees and shrubs.Specific epithet means elliptic in reference to leaf shape.Common name of shoebutton ardisia is in reference to the purported resemblance of the fruit to old fashioned black shoe buttons.  Common name of duck’s-eyes is in reference to the purported resemblance of the black fruits to the eyes of a flock of ducks hiding in the plant foliage.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Invasive plant that cannot legally be grown in areas where growth is prohibited by law.  In areas where it may be legally grown, growth is often discouraged where aggressive spread is likely to occur.  This plant generally performs best in shady areas with moist to wet soils.  Often thrives in moist woodland areas and shade gardens.

Freely self-seeds to the point where it has escaped gardens and has the potential to naturalize in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ardisia japonica, commonly known as Japanese ardisia or marlberry, is a low-growing, coarsely-textured, stoloniferous, woody evergreen shrub which spreads by underground runners to produce a succession of upright stems rising to 8-12” tall.  Stems are clad with thick, glossy, leathery, serrulate-margined, opposite or subwhorled, elliptic to lanceolate leaves (each to 3” long) which are densely concentrated near the branch ends.  It is native to mixed forests or bamboo woods, hillsides, and dark damp places in southeastern China, Japan and Korea.  Japanese ardisia will rapidly spread by suckers to form a dense ground cover shrub for shady areas of the landscape.  It can produce large colonies over time.  Small, five-petaled, white to pale pink flowers (each to 3/8” diameter) bloom in July-August in 3-5 flowered panicles.  Flowers are followed by showy red drupes which ripen to black in fall.  

This plant is one of the 50 Fundamental herbs in Chinese medicine.  It is used for a large number of different medical applications including treatment of bronchitis.Genus name comes from the Greek aradis meaning a point in reference to the pointed anthers of these flowering trees and shrubs.Specific epithet means from Japan in reference to native habitat.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Performs well in sandy or gravelly soils of somewhat poor quality. Plant new seeds in the ground each year slightly before last spring frost date. Plants dislike transplanting and can be difficult to start indoors in pots. Plants may self-seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Argemone polyanthemos, commonly called prickly poppy, is a deep-taprooted annual or biennial that is native to sandy and grassy soils on plains, slopes, foothills and roadsides from Texas and New Mexico north to Wyoming and South Dakota. It has been introduced or has spread to some areas adjacent to the original range, including west of the Rocky Mountains. This species has fewer prickles than most other poppies in the genus, and is particularly distinguished by the absence of prickles on upper leaf surfaces. Plants typically grow to 3’ (less frequently 4’) tall clad with leaves (to 8” long) that are lobed. Leaves and stems are pale blue green. Flowers (3-4” wide) bloom from late spring into summer. Each flower has 4-6 crumpled white petals and a dense center cluster of yellow stamens. Flowers give way to sparsely prickly seed capsules in late summer. Broken stems ooze an orange-yellow sap. All parts of the plant are poisonous. Plants were once used as a cataract treatment.Genus name comes from the Greek word argemon for a poppy-like plant.Specific epithet means many flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Downy mildew, anthracnose and root rot may occur.
","
Garden Uses
Garden annual for beds and borders.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. Grow as an annual in the St. Louis area. Cultivars do not come true from seed, but cuttings may be taken from prized plants in late summer for overwintering. Deadhead spent flowers to encourage additional bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Argyranthemum frutescens, commonly called marguerite daisy, is a somewhat short-lived, tender perennial or subshrub that produces daisy-like white flowers (2.5” diameter) with yellow center disks on bushy plants growing 2-3’ tall and as wide. Blooms throughout the summer, but may slow down considerably in the heat of a St. Louis summer. Deeply cut, dark green leaves are aromatic when bruised. Pink, yellow and white cultivars, some with double flowers and/or blue green foliage, are available. Synonymous with and formerly known as Chrysanthemum frutescens. Also sometimes commonly called Paris daisy.Genus name comes from Greek meaning silvery flower.Specific epithet means shrubby or bushy.

Culture
Best grown in humusy, medium to wet, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Needs constantly moist soil rich in organic matter. Does poorly in heavy clay soils. This native wildflower is somewhat uncommon and should be left alone in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arisaema dracontium, commonly called green dragon, is very similar to Jack-in-the pulpit, except green dragon usually has only one large, long-petioled, compound leaf that is divided into 7-15 lance-shaped leaflets and has a greenish spadix which is narrower and tapers up and beyond the less prominent, greenish hood (lacks the distinctive purple striping of Jack) of the spathe. Also like Jack-in-the-Pulpit, this plant goes dormant in the summer, with the mature plants producing red berries which become visible in mid to late summer as the spadix withers. Roots contain calcium oxalate (same chemical as in Diffenbachia or dumb cane) and are poisonous in an uncooked state.Genus name comes from Greek words aris meaning arum and aima meaning red in reference to the red-blotched leaves found on some species.Specific epithet means small dragon.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
An interesting native spring wildflower for the shady woodland garden, wild garden or native plant garden. Grows well in moist conditions along streams or ponds. Combine with hostas which will continue to fill the space in summer when these plants go dormant.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arisaema triphyllum, commonly called Jack-in-the-pulpit, is a spring woodland wildflower usually growing 1- 2' tall. Flower structure consists of the spadix (Jack) which is an erect spike containing numerous, tiny, green to purple flowers and the sheath-like spathe (pulpit) which encases the lower part of the spadix and then opens to form a hood extending over the top of the spadix. The outside of the spathe is usually green or purple and the inside is usually striped purple and greenish white, though considerable color variations exist. Two large green, compound, long-petioled leaves (1-1.5' long), divided into three leaflets each, emanate upward from a single stalk and provide umbrella-like shade to the flower. The fleshy stalk and leaves lend an almost tropical aura to the plant. Flowering plants initially produce only male flowers, but become hermaphroditic as they further age (male flowers on upper part of spadix and female on lower part). Most plants in a colony will vanish by mid-summer (become dormant), but the mature, hermaphroditic flowering plant will produce a cluster of red berries in mid to late summer which becomes visible as the spathe withers. Roots contain calcium oxalate (same chemical as in Diffenbachia or dumb cane) and are poisonous.Genus name comes from Greek words aris meaning arum and aima meaning red in reference to the red-blotched leaves found on some species.Specific epithet means three-leaved.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Garden Uses
Best left undisturbed in the shady woodland garden, wild garden or native plant garden.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is easily grown in moderately fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Avoid dry soils. This vine appreciates some part shade in hot inland areas.  Prune if needed in late winter to early spring. Will not survive outdoor temperatures that dip below 30 degrees F.   Needs some support if upright growth is desired.  Propagate by cuttings.  Vine stems may root where they touch the soil thus creating new plants which may be dug up and moved.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aristolochia californica, commonly called California Dutchman’s pipe, is a rhizomatous, deciduous, fast growing, twining vine of the birthwort family that typically grows to 12-15’ long on dull brown, rope-like stems clad with fuzzy, pale-green, heart-shaped leaves (to 3-6” long).  It is most noted for producing unusual pipe-shaped flowers (each to 1.5” long) which bloom in late winter to early spring.  Each flower is pale green with long burgundy veins.  Flowers are apetalous (no petals), but the calyx of each flower assumes the shape of a curved Dutchman’s smoking pipe, hence the common name.  Each flower is formed by fused sepals and dangles on its own naked stem.  Flowers are pollinated by certain tiny insects (fungus gnats may prove to be the effective pollinators) that are lured into the calyx by the potent but foul smell of the flower where they become temporarily trapped, covered with pollen and then released to pollinate other flowers.  Each pollinated flower is followed by a 6-winged dehiscent seed capsule which opens basipetally when ripe to release its seed for distribution by wind.

This vine is native to northern and central California where it is most often found in woodlands, mountain foothills and streambanks usually below 1500’ in elevation.  

Aristolochia is the sole host for the pipevine swallowtail butterfly.  Eggs laid on plant leaves hatch, and the plant leaves become the sole food for the emerging larvae (showy black caterpillars with red spotting).  Leaves contain poisons which make not only the caterpillars but also the subsequent butterflies poisonous to predators.Genus name comes from the Greek words aristos meaning best and locheia meaning childbirth or delivery in reference to the fact that plants of some species within this genus (1) have a flower structure which more closely resembles a human fetus in the womb than a pipe, and (2) served in the past as the source of ancient plant preparations used for treatment of pain and infections incident to childbirth.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to this species being native to the State of California.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Root rot, leaf spot and southern blight may occur.  Can be an aggressive spreader in optimum growing conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in areas where the unique flowers can be easily observed (along a path, near a patio).  Where winter hardy, it needs a trellis, arbor or other structure on which to grow unless it is being used as a scrambling ground cover.  Allow it to weave through shrubs or small trees.  Good screening vine for a porch.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 6 (perhaps Zone 5) to 9 where it is easily grown in medium moisture, moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Avoid dry soils.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aristolochia clematitis, commonly called birthwort, is a rhizomatous, deciduous, non-climbing perennial of the birthwort family that typically grows to 2-3’ (infrequently to 4’) tall on stems clad with heart-shaped leaves (to 4 1/2” long).  Apetalous (no petals) greenish-yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early summer (June-July) in clusters from the leaf axils.  Each flower (to 1” diameter) has a straight funnel-shaped tube with pointed, curved upper lips (considerably different in appearance from the curved Dutchman’s smoking pipe-type blooms found on some other species in the genus).  Flowers are pollinated by certain tiny insects.  Each pollinated flower is followed by a 6-valved seed capsule.

This birthwort is native to Europe, but has been introduced into and naturalized in a few parts of North America including Quebec, Ontario and New York to Ohio and Maryland where it is most commonly found in the wild along roadsides and in waste places.  

This European species was used by medieval midwives following the medieval Doctrine of Signatures under the belief that God had marked plants in such a way that doctors could recognize from plant appearance what diseases the plants were able to treat.  The womb-like appearance of some birthwort flowers led to the belief that this plant would help treat problems of childbirth.  Accordingly, juice from plant stems, which contains aristolochic acid, became commonly used as a medicine during labor, hence the common name of birthwort.  Today, it is known that aristolochic acid is very poisonous to humans (regular ingestion of very small amounts can cause both urinary tract cancers and kidney failure).   In 2001, the FDA warned that no herbal medicines containing aristolochic acid should be used.   

Aristolochia plants are the host for the pipevine swallowtail butterfly.  Eggs are laid on plant leaves.  Eggs hatch and the plant leaves become the sole food for the emerging larvae (caterpillars).  Leaves contain poisons which make not only the larvae but also the subsequent butterflies poisonous to predators.Genus name comes from the Greek words aristos meaning best and locheia meaning childbirth or delivery in reference to the fact that plants of some species within this genus (1) have a flower structure which more closely resembles a human fetus in the womb than a pipe, and (2) served in the past as the source of ancient plant preparations used for treatment of pain and infections incident to childbirth.Specific epithet means resembling Clematis.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Root rot, leaf spot and southern blight may occur.  Can be an aggressive spreader in optimum growing conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Interesting plants, but flowers lack the conversation-piece quality of the Dutchman pipe type blooms.  Best ornamental feature of this plant is the attractive foliage.  Best planted in small groups.  Borders.  Naturalized areas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aristolochia macrophylla is a deciduous, woody, climbing vine that is an eastern American native which typically occurs in the wild in rich, moist woods and along streams. Can rapidly grow to 20-30'. An old-fashioned favorite that is grown for its large, heart-shaped, densely overlapping leaves (6-12"" long) which can quickly cover an arbor or trellis with attractive, glossy, deep green foliage. Although the flowers make interesting conversation pieces, they are usually hidden by the dense foliage and are somewhat inconspicuous.Genus name comes from the Greek words aristos meaning best and locheia meaning childbirth or delivery in reference to the fact that plants of some species within this genus (1) have a flower structure which more closely resembles a human fetus in the womb than a pipe, and (2) served in the past as the source of ancient plant preparations used for treatment of pain and infections incident to childbirth.Specific epithet means large-leaved.Commonly called Dutchman's pipe because the unusual, 2"" long, yellowish-green flowers (each flaring at the calyx mouth to form 3 brownish-purple lobes) superficially resemble Dutch smoking pipes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Will quickly provide dense cover for sun porches, verandas, pillars, posts, trellises, arbors, fences or walls. Has been used for many years to screen front porches, and is capable of creating a deep shade.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aristolochia tomentosa, commonly called Dutchman's pipe, is a woody, deciduous, twining vine which is native to Missouri where it typically occurs along streams and in moist woods primarily in counties south of the Missouri River. It is typically seen in the wild climbing trees or shrubs and can rapidly grow to 20-30' tall. Features large, heart-shaped, densely-overlapping leaves (4-8"" long) which can quickly cover an arbor or trellis with deep green foliage. Blooms in mid to late spring in the St. Louis area. Although the flowers make interesting conversation pieces, they are usually hidden by the dense foliage and are somewhat inconspicuous. Flowers give way to ribbed, tubular seed capsules (to 3"" long) which mature to a grayish-brown in September. The leaves, young stems and flowers of this species are hairy (tomentose as the species name suggests). Very similar to A. macrophylla which is native to eastern North America, except A. macrophylla is basically glabrous (smooth). Aristolochia is a larval plant for the pipe vine swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek words aristos meaning best and locheia meaning childbirth or delivery in reference to the fact that plants of some species within this genus (1) have a flower structure which more closely resembles a human fetus in the womb than a pipe, and (2) served in the past as the source of ancient plant preparations used for treatment of pain and infections incident to childbirth.Specific epithet means hairy.Commonly called Dutchman's pipe because the unusual, 2"" long, yellowish-green, curved-trumpet flowers (each flaring at the calyx mouth to form three brownish-purple lobes) superficially resemble Dutch smoking pipes.

Culture
Best grown in infertile, dry, well-drained soils in full sun. Foliage mounds tend to rot in the center if grown in moist, fertile soils or in heavy clay. Good drainage is essential. Deadhead spend flower stems to encourage additional bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Armeria maritima, commonly called thrift or sea pink, is a compact, low-growing plant which forms a dense, mounded tuft of stiff, linear, grass-like, dark green leaves (to 4"" tall). Tufts will spread slowly to 8-12"" wide. Tiny, pink to white flowers bloom in mid spring in globular clusters (3/4-1"" wide) atop slender, naked stalks rising well above the foliage to 6-10"" tall. Sporadic additional flowering may occur throughout the summer. Flower clusters are subtended by purplish, papery bracts.Genus name is Latinized from the old French name armoires for a cluster-headed dianthus.Specific epithet means pertaining to the sea or coastal.In the wild, thrift or sea pink commonly grows in saline environments along coastal areas where few other plants can grow well, hence the common name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
A compact plant for edging, border fronts, rock gardens or wall pockets. May be massed as a ground cover for small areas. Impractical large scale ground cover due to slow spread. Also effective in containers.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun. Soil rich in organic matter will produce the largest, most pungent roots. Plants rarely produce viable seed. Usually grown as an annual (i.e., plant root cuttings in spring and harvest roots in late fall), however roots may be harvested at any time (they can remain in the soil year-round, but should be harvested no later than the following spring).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Armoracia rusticana, commonly called horseradish, is a somewhat coarse vegetable that is grown for its pungent, fleshy roots which are harvested and grated to make sauces or relishes. Plant features large, variably sized (up to 2' long), dock-like, toothed, shiny, dark green leaves and insignificant, whitish flowers which appear in summer in terminal panicles. An extremely vigorous plant that crowds out most weeds and is itself weed-like, with a very spreading growth habit (particularly if the roots are not harvested every year).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name of a related plant.Specific epithet means pertaining to the country.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be difficult to eliminate from an area since tiny pieces of root left behind after harvest can generate new plants.
","
Garden Uses
Grow in a quiet, sunny corner of the vegetable garden where its spreading habit will not crowd out other plants.

If grown from seed, large basal leaves will appear the first year, but flowering stems may not appear until the second or third years. Flowering stems may be cut back to the basal foliage after bloom to encourage a lower, secondary bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arnoglossum atriplicifolium, commonly called pale Indian plantain, is a tall Missouri native herbaceous perennial which grows 3-6' (less frequently to 8') tall and typically occurs in open and rocky woodlands, thickets, slopes, wet meadows and along streams throughout the State. Features flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of tiny, white tubular flowers atop thick, rigid, leafy flowering stalks rising from the basal foliage. Blooms in summer. Fan-shaped basal leaves (to 12"" wide) are thick, leathery, and coarsely toothed and lobed, somewhat resembling very large sycamore leaves. Stems and lower leaf surfaces are covered with a grayish-white bloom hence the ""pale"" part of the common name. Synonymous with Cacalia atriplicifolia.Specific epithet means with leaves like salt-bush.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Naturalizes well in woodland, wild, cottage or native plant gardens. Height and substance make this an interesting selection for grouping in border backgrounds, though the plant is somewhat coarse and is often considered to lack sufficient ornamental qualities for inclusion in borders. Uncommonly sold by nurseries.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aronia arbutifolia, commonly called red chokeberry, is a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub that is native to both wet and dry thickets in Eastern North America (Nova Scotia and Ontario to Ohio south to Texas and Florida). It typically grows in a vase-shaped form to 6-10’ tall and to 3-6' wide, but tends to sucker and form colonies. Clusters (corymbs) of white to light pink, 5-petaled flowers (1/3”diameter) appear in spring. Flowers are followed by abundant glossy red fruits (1/4” diameter) which appear in dense clusters along the branches. Fruits ripen in late summer and persist on the shrub throughout fall and well into winter. Elliptic to oblong to obovate leaves (to 3 1/2” long) are glossy dark green above and pubescent grayish-green beneath. Foliage turns bright red in autumn and compares favorably with burning bush (Euonymus alatus) for excellence of fall color. Fruits are sometimes used to make tasty jams and jellies. Aronia arbutifolia is synonymous with Pyrus arbutifolis and Photinia pyrifolia.Genus name comes from the Greek word aria  the name for a species of Sorbus of which the fruits resemble chokeberry.Specific epithet means having leaves like Arbutus.Common name is in reference to the tart and bitter berries which are technically edible but are so astringent as to cause choking in those who try.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spots and twig/fruit blight.
","
Garden Uses
Group or mass in shrub borders or woodland areas. Ability to withstand wet conditions makes it suitable for growing on the margins of ponds or streams. Also effective in naturalized areas where its suckering, colonial growth habit does not need to be restrained. Good native plant with multi-season ornamental interest.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aronia melanocarpa, commonly called black chokeberry, is an open, upright, spreading, somewhat rounded but leggy, suckering, deciduous shrub that typically grows 3-6’ tall.  It is native to low woods, swamps, bogs and moist thickets but occasionally to dry upland areas, from Newfoundland to southern Ontario and Minnesota south to Missouri, Tennessee and Georgia.  Although common in many parts of its native range, it is somewhat rare in Missouri where it is only found in sandy wet or boggy ground along spring branches at the base of Crowley Ridge in southeastern Stoddard County (Steyermark).  It is noted for its 5-6 flowered clusters of white 5-petaled spring (May) flowers, glossy elliptic to obovate dark green leaves (to 2-3” long) with finely toothed margins, black autumn berries (blueberry size) and purple/red fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek word aria  the name for a species of Sorbus of which the fruits resemble chokeberry.Specific epithet comes from the words melano meaning black and carpa meaning fruit in reference to the ripe fruits of this shrub.The common name of chokeberry is in reference to the tart and bitter taste of the fruits which are technically edible but so astringent as to cause choking in most of those who try.  Fruits are sometimes used to make tasty jams and jellies.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Prefers a neutral soil.  Avoid wet soils.  Appreciates a sheltered location and year-round mulch in the St. Louis area.  Established plants have drought tolerance.  Cut plants to the ground in early spring.  Dividing the clumps every 3-4 years will help keep plants robust.   Plants will thrive in dry heat, but generally dislike the hot and humid conditions of the deep South.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia abrotanum, commonly called southernwood, is a perennial sub-shrub that typically grows on woody, upright-branching stems to form a 3-4’ tall bushy mound of ferny, strongly aromatic, medium to light green leaves, each of which is 1-3 times pinnately dissected into threadlike segments.  Southernwood is native to southern Europe, most likely in countries along the Mediterranean from Spain to Italy.  It was introduced into the eastern U.S. in the early 1600s, and has naturalized over time into parts of the northeast primarily in disturbed sites (fields, roadsides, and waste areas).  It is semi-evergreen in frost-free winter climates, but deciduous in cold winter locations.  Although once planted as both a culinary herb and a medicinal herb, it is primarily grown in gardens today for its attractive ornamental foliage augmented by its pleasant citrus to camphor-like foliage fragrance.  Leaves retain good fragrance after drying, hence their use in sachets, as air fresheners and for discouraging clothing moths.  This plant flowers infrequently in eastern North America.  When flowering does occur, nodding yellowish-white flowers (each to 3/16” across) bloom in loose panicles from late August into October.  Flowers are not particularly showy.  In the northern parts of its growing range, seeds often do not reach maturity for this late-bloomer prior to the onset of cold weather.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet from Greek means wormwood or southernwood.This plant has acquired a large number of additional common names over time including lad’s love, maid’s love or old man.  French name for this plant is garderobe meaning guard the wardrobe in recognition of the practice of placing plant sprigs in closets or clothing drawers to deter moths.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.
","
Garden Uses
Southernwood is an aromatic herb that is grown in herb gardens.  It also may be effectively grown in borders or along walks or paths.  Low hedge.  Herb containers.

Culture
Best grown in poor to moderately fertile, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Excellent soil drainage is essential for growing this plant well. Does poorly in moist to wet soils where plants are susceptible to root rot. Plant stems tend to lodge in summer, especially if grown in fertile soils and/or part shade. General foliage decline commonly occurs in climates with high summer rainfall and in climates with high summer humidity such as the St. Louis area. Consider pinching back stems in late spring to reduce mature plant height and to prevent legginess. If foliage declines or stems flop in summer, plants may be sheared to revitalize. Promptly deadhead flowers to prevent any unwanted self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia absinthium, commonly called absinthe or wormwood, is a woody-based perennial that is grown for its attractive silver-gray foliage that adds interesting texture and contrast to gardens. It typically forms a clump of generally erect, non-woody, hairy, gray-green stems to 2-3’ tall. Stems are clad with deeply-incised, pinnately-divided, silvery-green leaves (to 2-5” long) covered with silky-white hairs. Foliage is highly aromatic when bruised. The tiny, somewhat inconspicuous, yellowish-gray, discoid flower heads (rays absent), which appear in dense, leafy, drooping panicles at the stem ends in summer, have little ornamental value. This species is native to the Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia, but has naturalized in parts of the United States, most notably in New England. Foliage is similar to that of A. vulgaris, except much more aromatic. Absinthium means without sweetness in reference to the extremely bitter taste of the plant juices. After many years, a 1912 ban on using absinthe in the U.S. was finally overtuned on March 5, 2007. Jade Liquors, LLC a distiller of premier absinthe located in Saumur, France states, ""Since 2007, genuine absinthe has again been legal in the USA, and genuine products are distilled from whole plants, and never from artificial flavorings.""Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is the Latin and pre-Linnaean name for wormwood.
","
Problems
Foliage may decline and plant stems may flop in summer. Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.
","
Garden Uses
Silver foliage provides excellent contrast to flowering plants and green foliage in beds, borders and herb gardens. Also can be effective in rock gardens. Good selection for areas with poor dry soils.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia dracunculus, commonly called wild tarragon, is a polymorphic species that is native to temperate Europe and Asia.  It is also found in western North America, though many of these populations may have resulted from introduction and naturalization.  It produces viable seed and will often self-seed.  Its leaves produce variable flavor and aroma, sometimes lacking both flavor and aroma.  It has a long history of medicinal uses, but the species is not often used for culinary purposes.  It is a rhizomatous perennial or sub-shrub that typically grows to 24” (less frequently to 36”) tall on generally erect stems clad with narrow, linear to lance-shaped, light to medium green leaves (to 3-4” long). Greenish white flowers in narrow elongated panicles bloom in summer.  

Tarragon sold under the species name without reference to cultivar or variety may be the less pungent Russian tarragon, which is considered by most cooks to be significantly inferior for culinary use. See A. d. 'Sativa' for information on French tarragon.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is a Latin word meaning a small dragon.
","
Problems
Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.  French tarragon does not always survive St. Louis winters, and wet soils in winter is a common cause of plant demise.
","
Garden Uses
Wild  tarragon is an aromatic herb that is primarily grown in herb gardens.  It also may be effectively grown in containers or window boxes.  It is generally not considered suitable for borders or other ornamental plantings.

Culture
Best grown in poor to moderately fertile, dry, well-drained soils in full sun. Excellent soil drainage is essential for growing this plant well. Does poorly in moist to wet soils where plants are susceptible to root rot. Plants typically develop deep taproots in dry soils, but often develop much shallower root systems if grown in moist soils. Plant stems may lodge in the summer, especially if grown in fertile soils and/or part shade. General foliage decline often occurs in high humidity summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Prune plants in spring to control growth, but be careful to leave sufficient numbers of live buds on each stem to facilitate bushy growth. Never prune stems to the ground. Foliage may also be lightly sheared in summer to shape, but avoid pruning in fall. Foliage is evergreen in warm winter climates, but not in the St. Louis area.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia frigida is a tufted, low-spreading, woody-based perennial that is primarily cultivated for its aromatic (camphor-scented), silver-white foliage. Erect, clustered, herbaceous stems with deeply-cut, silky-haired, silvery-white foliage rise up from tough, woody crowns. Stems typically grow to 9-16” tall in gardens. Tiny yellow flowers in nodding clusters bloom in summer, but are not particularly showy. Foliage is finely divided and feathery in appearance, hence the also used common names of fringed sagebrush, fringed sage-wort and fringed wormwood. This species is native to western North America, where it is most commonly found on dry open sites and waste areas in the Great Plains, foothills and mountains. Although it has spread or escaped gardens in at least two different western Missouri counties (Steyermark), it is not considered to be a Missouri native plant. Additional common names for this species include praire sagewort, pasture sagebrush and mouintain sage.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet means growing in cold regions.
","
Problems
Plants tend to open up in summer in hot and humid climates. Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.
","
Garden Uses
Silver-white foliage provides excellent contrast to flowering plants and green foliage in rock gardens, wildflower gardens, border fronts and herb gardens. Good selection for areas with poor dry soils.

Culture
Best grown in poor to moderately fertile, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Excellent soil drainage is essential for growing this plant well. Plants perform poorly in moist to wet soils where they are susceptible to root rot. Plant stems tend to lodge in summer, especially if grown in fertile soils and/or part shade. General foliage decline commonly occurs in high humidity summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Consider pinching back stems in late spring to reduce mature plant height. If foliage declines or stems flop in summer, plants may be sheared to revitalize. Plants may spread somewhat aggressively in the garden by rhizomes and by self-seeding. Prompt removal of flower heads as they appear prevents self-seeding. Soil barriers may be considered to help contain rhizomatous spread. Propagate by division in late summer to early autumn.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia ludoviciana is native throughout North America from Canada to Mexico. In Missouri, it is typically found growing on rocky prairies, glades, bluff escarpments, open wooded slopes, waste ground, along roads and railroads primarily in the northern and western parts of the State (Steyermark). It is commonly called white sage because of the appearance of its foliage. This is an erect, rhizomatous, somewhat weedy, herbaceous perennial that grows in spreading clumps to 2-3' (less frequently to 4') tall on greenish white stems clad with aromatic, sage-like, lance-shaped leaves (to 2-4” long) that are white woolly beneath and nearly glabrous above. Foliage adds texture and contrast to gardens. Tiny, somewhat inconspicuous, yellowish-gray, discoid flower heads (rays absent) appear in dense panicles at the stem ends in summer. Flowers have little ornamental value. Flowers give way to dry achenes. Foliage is aromatic when bruised.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is in reference to the Louisiana Territory.Popular cultivars of this species include A. ludoviciana 'Silver King' and A. ludoviciana 'Valerie Finnis'.
","
Problems
Foliage may decline and plant stems may flop in summer. Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly-drained ones. Watch for unwanted spread by rhizomes and/or self-seeding.
","
Garden Uses
Silver-green foliage provides excellent contrast to flowering plants and green foliage. Invasive habit discourages use of this plant in borders or herb gardens. Good selection for areas with poor dry soils. Good selection for isolated areas where it can naturalize without risk to other plants.

Culture
Best grown in poor to moderately fertile, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Does poorly in moist to wet soils where plants are susceptible to root rot.  Plant stems tend to lodge in the summer, especially if grown in fertile soils and/or significant shade.  General foliage decline often occurs in high humidity summer climates such as the St. Louis area.  If foliage declines or stems flop in summer, plants may be sheared to revitalize.  Plants can spread aggressively in the landscape.  Easily propagated by division. Notwithstanding historical uses, species’ plants are considered by many gardeners today as being not much more than roadside weeds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia vulgaris, commonly known by a large number of common names including mugwort, wild wormwood, and felon herb, is an upright rhizomatous herbaceous perennial which grows 2-4’ (less frequently to 6') tall but spreads in the landscape by rhizomes, often aggressively, to 6’ wide or more.  

It is native to and widespread in Europe and throughout northern Asia from Russia to Japan and Korea.  It can be weedy and invasive, particularly in disturbed sites.  It was introduced as an herbal plant into a number of sites in North America, starting with the first European visits in the early 1600's.  Plants have naturalized over time throughout southern Canada, the eastern and Midwestern United States (Maine to Minnesota south to Florida and Louisiana) and in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana).  It typically grows in loamy or sandy soils in forested areas, coastal strands and along roadsides.   

Plants feature (a) angular reddish-brown stems, (b) aromatic, petiolate, deeply lobed and cut basal and middle leaves which grow to as much as 4” long, each leaf being deep green above and white tomentose beneath, (c) smaller and narrower cauline upper leaves which become linear in the flower panicles, (d) yellowish to reddish brown apetalous discoid flowers (to 1/8” across) which bloom late summer to early fall in dense leafy panicles, and (e) achenes which follow the flowers.  

This species has a long history of human use in Europe and Asia as an herbal medicine.  Leaves are technically edible, but bitter and toxic when consumed in quantity.  Aroma from fresh or dried plant leaves will repel insects.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet means common.Common name of felon herb comes from a prior herbal medicinal use of this plant in the treatment of felons, a painful pus-producing infection which typically occurs at the end of a finger or toe.  Mugwort common name (mug means drinking vessel) comes from an historical use of this plant in Europe to flavor beer before the introduction of hops.  Wormwood common name is in reference to the former European growth of this plant as a vermifuge (folk medicine remedy for expelling worms from the intestinal tract).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Plants tend to open up in summer.  Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.  Watch for rhizomatous spread.
","
Garden Uses
Good selection for areas with poor dry soils.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.  This is a tropical tree that requires consistent moisture, a temperature in excess of 60 degrees F., and high humidity (70-80%).  It performs best in deep, fertile, humusy, well-drained soils, including sandy-alkaline ones, but has adapted to a variety of different soil types in various parts of its large geographic range.  Seeded breadfruit is grown from seeds.  Seedless breadfruit is grown from suckers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Artocarpus altilis, commonly known as breadfruit, is a tropical to sub-tropical evergreen tree of the mulberry family that typically grows with a spreading crown to 30-50’ (less frequently to 80’) tall.  Trunk diameter ranges from 2-6’.  All parts of the tree contain a latex milky sap.  This tree grows in both seeded and seedless forms, with the commonly marketed cultivars being seedless.  Breadfruit is an important food source in many tropical countries.  

Breadfruit is probably native to an area extending from New Guinea to Micronesia.  It has spread widely over time in tropical areas around the globe not only in the Pacific Ocean but also to Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean Sea, Central America, northern South America and parts of Africa.  It is believed that breadfruit initially came to Hawaii in canoes from Polynesia.  

Each tree features leathery, pinnately-lobed, dark green leaves (to 10-36” long and to 10-20” wide), each of which features 5-11 deeply cut lobes.  

Monoecious flowers (male and female flowers on the same tree) bloom somewhat continuously year round in the Pacific Islands, but often with more sporadic periods of bloom occurring in other geographic areas.  Flowers grow on short stems from the trunks and large branches (cauliflorus).  Male flowers appear in pendant spikes to 10” long and female flowers in oval-rounded heads to 2 1/2” long.   

Female flowers give way to large, rounded, smooth to spiny, green to yellowish-green, compound, rounded fruits (massive spherical syncarps) which typically mature to 5-12” in diameter with a weight of 7-10 pounds.  Each fruit has white to pale yellow flesh.  Fruit flesh is quite edible if cooked (boiled or baked), with the cooked fruit reportedly having a potato-like flavor.  Baked fruit has the aroma and texture of fresh baked bread, hence the common name.  Eating raw uncooked fruit flesh will cause nausea.  A single tree can produce as many as 200 grapefruit-sized fruits per year.  

Famine in the West Indies in the early 1780s prompted British plantation owners to petition King George III of England to bring seedless breadfruit trees by ship from the East Indies to the West Indies in order to develop an additional food source for slaves working in sugar cane fields.  King George III responded by sending Captain William Bligh to Tahiti in 1787 on the H.M.S. Bounty to pick up a load of breadfruit plants for transport to the British West Indies.   The Bounty loaded over 1000 plants on board at Tahiti in 1788, but, shortly after sailing, the mutiny on the Bounty instigated by Fletcher Christian occurred resulting in a termination of the planned voyage.Genus name comes from the Greek words artos meaning bread and karpos meaning fruit.Specific epithet means fat or stout in reference to the fruit.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Garden Uses
In tropical areas, breadfruit is grown primarily for ornamental reasons or as a source of food.  Wood is used for various purposes including home construction.  Excellent shade tree.    Although somewhat commonly grown in Hawaii, it is otherwise not grown in the remaining parts of the U. S. except for a few plants in the south Florida Keys.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it is best grown in deep, rich, acidic, consistently and evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants generally like warm, sunny, humid conditions. Avoid dry soils. Plants perform best in frost free climates. Established plants will tolerate an occasional light frost, but young plants may be killed by any frost. Plants are intolerant of temperatures below 28 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artocarpus heterophyllus, commonly called jackfruit, is a tropical to subtropical evergreen tree that is native from India to Malaya Peninsula. It is a large, straight-trunked, somewhat stately tree that typically grows 30-70' (sometimes to 90') tall. It is best noted for bearing the largest fruits of any tree in the world. It is considered to be califlorous (flowers and fruits grow on short stems from the trunks and large branches). Fruits are generally melon-shaped, growing from 1-3' long and from 9-20"" in diameter, with weight ranging from 10-35 (less frequently to 80) pounds. Average fruits are 1-2' long and 9-12"" in diameter. Large fruits may have from 100 to 500 seeds. Fruit skin (rind) is covered with hard cone-like knobs. Pale green unripened fruits ripen to greenish-yellow or brown with a soft custard-yellow inner flesh. Ripe unopened fruits have an offensive aroma (decayed onions) while the aromatic pulp smells like banana or pineapple. Unripened fruits may be prepared like a vegetable. Ripened fruits may be eaten fresh or cooked. Seeds may be boiled and roasted (chestnut-like taste). Jackfruit is quite popular in southeast Asia. Trunk, branches and leaves contain a gummy latex. Leathery, elliptic to ovate leaves (to 8"" long) are glossy deep green. Monoecious greenish flowers (male and female flowers in separate flower heads) primarily bloom spring to fall (specific time depending on climate and variety) with sporadic additional bloom at other times.Genus name comes from the Greek words artos meaning bread and karpos meaning fruit.Specific epithet means diversely leaved.

Culture
Best grown in medium moisture, consistently moist, humusy, organically rich soils in part shade to full shade. Not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where it should be planted in a protected location. New leaves emerge in autumn and are evergreen in warm winter climates. However, in cold winter climates such as the St. Louis area, the leaves die in winter with new leaves emerging in early spring. In all climates, foliage goes dormant in summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arum italicum, sometimes commonly called Italian arum, is a stemless woodland species native to Europe. Typically grows 12-18"" tall. It resembles our native Jack-in-the-Pulpit (Arisaema tryphyllum). Each flower consists of (1) an erect, finger-like spadix covered with minute, creamy white flowers and (2) a large, sheath-like, light green spathe (bract) which subtends and partially envelops the spadix like a hood. Flowers produced in spring. Arrowhead-shaped, long-petioled, glossy grayish-green leaves with pale green midribs are 8-12"" long. After bloom, the leaves and spathe die back leaving only the thick spadix which develops attractive, bright orange-red berries in summer. New leaves emerge in autumn and remain evergreen in warm winter climates but die back in cold winter climates such as St. Louis where they emerge again in early spring. All parts of this plant are toxic.Genus name comes from aron the Greek name for these poisonous plants which are closely related to the American jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema).Specific epithet means of Italy.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich soils in full sun to part shade. Foliage decline can occur rapidly if soils are permitted to dry out. With consistent moisture, it performs well in full sun in the northern portions of its growing range. It prefers part shade in the southern part of its growing range. Removing faded flower stalks will not prolong bloom, but may improve plant appearance, particularly if a ground cover look is desired. On the other hand, flower stalks on female plants may be left in place to enjoy the continuing ornamental effect of the dried seed plumes. Plants can be slow to establish. Plants may struggle in the hot and humid conditions of the deep South and are not recommended for gardens south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aruncus dioicus, commonly called goat's beard, is a Missouri native plant which occurs in moist woodlands and along bluffs in the central and southeast part of the State. A tall, erect, bushy, clump-forming plant typically growing 4-6' high which features pinnately compound, dark green foliage and showy, plume-like spikes of tiny, cream colored flowers which rise well above the foliage in early to mid summer, creating a bold effect. This rose family member is somewhat similar in appearance to astilbe. Dioecious (separate male and female plants) as the species name suggests. Plants with male flowers (numerous stamens per flower) produce a showier bloom than plants with female flowers (three pistils per flower).Genus name is the classical Greek name for these plants.Specific epithet means having separate male and female plants.
","
Problems
No serious disease or insect problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Tall growing plants are excellent background plant for shady, moist spots in the border or in a woodland, wild or native plant garden. Plant as a specimen or in groups along streams or water gardens.

Where not winter hardy, this orchid may be grown in containers that are brought indoors in winter before first fall frost.   Fertilize regularly.   Thrives in humid conditions (misting helps in areas with low humidity).  Best with a dense potting mix with sharp drainage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arundina graminifolia is a terrestrial orchid with foliage that resembles a bamboo, hence the common name of bamboo orchid.  It is native to southeast Asia.  Reedy stems grow to 5-6' tall to form large clumps.  Stems are clad with narrow linear grass-like leaves (each to 4-8"" long) with sheaths that wrap the stems.  Cattleya-like flowers (to 2-3"" across) bloom throughout the year, but more heavily in summer.  Each flower features white or pink tepals and a ruffled pink to rose labellum with a yellow center.  Each flower is followed by a ribbed seed capsule which splits open when ripe to release its powdery seeds into the wind.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Arundina bambusifolia and Bletia graminifolia.Genus name comes from the Latin word arundo meaning a reed.Specific epithet means having grass-like leaves.

Culture
Best grown in consistently moist soils in full sun. Tolerates some sundapppled or light shade. Site in areas protected from drying winds. Thick organic mulch helps retain moisture and provides nutrients in summer plus protects roots in winter. If naturalization is not desired, rhizomatous spread may be discouraged via constructing soil barriers or growing plant in a very large plastic pot sunk to the rim.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arundinaria gigantea, commonly called giant cane, is a rhizomatous running bamboo that is native to river banks, moist bottomlands, swampy areas and bogs from Florida to Texas north to Kansas, southern Illinois and New York. In optimum growing conditions, it will naturalize to form immense, dense, primarily monocultural, often impenetrable colonies or stands commonly called canebrakes. Canebrakes once covered large multi-acre areas of river bottom land in the southeastern U.S. from the Carolinas to Texas, however by the 1800s such stands began to disappear as the result of a number of factors including conversion of cane land to farmland, livestock introduction, river dams/management and spreading urbanization. Giant cane spreads both by creeping branched rhizomes which send up new aerial stems and floating rhizome segments that spread by water current to new locations. Hard (woody), rigid stems (culms) rise to 5-12’ tall, but will grow to as much as 25’ tall in warm winter areas (USDA Zones 8-9). Coarse, lance-shaped, medium green leaves to 12” long and to 1.5” wide are evergreen in warm winter locations, but will die from sub-zero temperatures further north. Within its hardiness range, roots will usually survive winter even if the foliage dies, with the canes producing new foliage in spring. Lateral panicles of purplish flowers rarely appear.Genus name comes from the Latin word arundo meaning a reed.Specific epithet means unusually tall or large.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Somewhat aggressive in some environments. Rust and leafspots (fungal and bacterial) may occur.

Culture
Easily grown in full sun to light shade a wide variety of soils ranging from light sandy ones to heavy clays. Plants perform well in moist to wet soils including standing water. They also perform well in average well-drained garden soils with some tolerance for dry conditions. In St. Louis, plants will turn brown and die to the ground after fall frost. Cut plants to the ground after frost. Winter mulch will help protect plant roots. Plants may not flower in USDA Zones 6-7 or if they do flower may not produce fertile seed. Plants are easily propagated by soaking pieces of rhizome or stem in water. Root ball may be divided with a spade. For water gardens, plants may be grown in large containers in 1-5” of water in full sun to part shade (best for larger ponds). In frost-free areas (USDA Zones 9-11), plants remain evergreen and will spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding. Pieces of stem or rhizome may float downstream and root in a variety of new locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arundo donax, commonly called giant reed, is a rhizomatous, perennial, warm season grass that sports a somewhat tropical appearance. In mature form, it can make a very bold ornamental statement in the landscape. It is a bamboo-like plant that is native to Europe (primarily the Mediterranean region). It has been widely planted in southern regions of the U.S. for a variety of purposes ranging from ornamental plantings to erosion control. It has naturalized in most states south from northern California to Maryland south to Florida and Arizona. In frost-free regions, it will remain evergreen in winter and will typically grow to 20’ tall. In areas like St. Louis, plants will die to the ground in winter, but can still reach 12’ tall in a single growing season (shorter in average garden soils). Cane-like stems are clad with 2-ranked, smooth, arching, gray-green leaves to 2’ long and 3” wide. Purplish flowers appear in 1-2’ tall narrow inflorescences in fall, aging to silver. Plants may not bloom in climates with early frost.Genus name comes from the Latin word arundo meaning a reed.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In frost-free climates, giant reed remains evergreen year-round and is usually quite aggressive, especially along ditches or streams or other water bodies. It will outcompete most native vegetation. In St. Louis, giant reed is not invasive. In summer, foliage in tall clumps may lodge to the point where staking becomes necessary.
","
Garden Uses
Giant reed is best grown as a specimen or accent for border backgrounds or near water bodies. It may be used in large water gardens or along ponds. Young plants can be effectively used as container specimens. Inflorescences are attractive as cut flowers or for dried arrangements. Woodwind instrument reeds are made from stems of this plant.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asarum canadense, commonly called wild ginger, is a Missouri native spring wildflower which occurs in rich woods and wooded slopes throughout the State. Basically a stemless plant which features two downy, heart-shaped to kidney-shaped, handsomely veined, dark green, basal leaves (to 6"" wide). Cup-shaped, purplish brown flowers (1"" wide) appear in spring on short, ground-level stems arising from the crotch between the two basal leaves. Flowers are quite attractive on close inspection, but bloom singly on or near the ground and are usually hidden from view by the foliage. Although not related to culinary ginger (Zingiber officinale), the roots of this plant produce a scent that is reminiscent thereof. Fresh or dried roots were used by early Americans as a ginger substitute, but the plant is not normally used today for culinary purposes.Genus name comes from the Latin and Greek name.Specific epithet means of Canada but also used to cover north-eastern U.S. by early writers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asarum caudatum, commonly known as western wild ginger or long-tailed ginger, is a rhizomatous, evergreen perennial that grows in a clump to 6” tall spreading to 18” wide or more.  It is native to moist, mixed conifer forests below 2200’ in elevation in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California, Idaho and western Montana where it often forms a thick understory ground cover.  It is primarily grown in landscapes for its (a) bold, heart-shaped, evergreen, bright green leaves (4-6” wide) which grow in pairs on long slender petioles from each node, (b) hirsute, cup-shaped, triangular, rusty brown to brownish purple to yellow green flowers which bloom at ground level somewhat concealed by the foliage from April to June, and (c) rhizomatous spread which typically forms an attractive foliage mat.  Leaves and roots smell of ginger when crushed, but plants in the genus Asarum are unrelated to culinary ginger (Zingiber officinalis).Genus name comes from the Latin and Greek name.Specific epithet means having a tail.

Culture
Blood flower is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual. It is easily grown from seed each year. Start seed indoors in pots 8-10 weeks before last spring frost date. Plant seedlings outside after last frost date. Grows best in light, rich, evenly moist, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Tolerates some soil dryness. Plants are noted for being weedy in their native tropical habitats and in warm winter areas such as the deep South where they will self-seed somewhat profusely. Plants will not self-seed in the St. Louis climate. Container plants may be cut back and brought inside into bright sunny locations in winter. May also be grown as an indoor plant in bright sun with regular watering during the growing season and with reduced watering in a cool location in winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias curassavica, commonly called blood flower, is a tender evergreen perennial in the dogbane and milkweed family. It is native to South America, but has naturalized worldwide in many tropical and subtropical areas. It has a much longer flowering period than the perennial milkweeds that are winter hardy in St. Louis. It typically grows as a subshrub to 2-3’ tall on upright stems clad with pointed, opposite, lanceolate leaves (to 6” long). Leaves are medium green sometimes with white midribs. Showy flowers with five sepals and five lobes appear in rounded axillary clusters (cymes) in late spring to early summer. Flowers are red-orange with yellow hoods. Flowering continues throughout the summer to early autumn. Hummingbirds, butterflies and bees are attracted to the flowers. Monarch butterflies lay eggs on this plant and the resulting larvae (caterpillars) use the plant leaves as a food source. Flowers are followed by long, narrow seed pods (3-4” long) which split open when ripe releasing silky tailed seeds for dispersal by wind. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Plants can be poisonous to livestock. Additional common names for this plant include tropical milkweed, scarlet milkweed, swallow wort, Indian root and matal.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means of Curacao of the Dutch Antilles in the southern Caribbean Sea.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Somewhat weedy and can spread in warm winter locations where it will self-seed. Watch for aphids. Sooty mold may develop if aphid populations are not checked. Consider wearing gloves when working with these plants because the milky sap is poisonous if ingested and can be toxic to human skin.
","
Garden Uses
Attractive foliage and flowers for beds, borders, cottage gardens, meadows and butterfly gardens. Also a good cut flower. Dried seed pods are attractive in arrangements.

Easily grown in average, dry to moist, sandy or gravely, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates part shade.  Best in sunny locations with sandy loams.  Drought tolerant.  Easily grown from seed, and will self-seed in the landscape if seed pods are not removed prior to splitting open.   Likes hot dry soils, but tolerates moist garden soils.  Plants will spread by rhizomes but are not considered invasive.  Performs poorly in wet soils.  Difficult to transplant because of deep roots.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias hirtella, commonly known as tall green milkweed or prairie milkweed, is an upright herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 3’ tall on one or more unbranched stems.  This is an uncommon species that is native to upland prairies, rocky glades, sandy wetland margins, roadsides, pastures and abandoned fields from Ontario and Minnesota south to Kansas, Louisiana and Georgia.  

Most milkweed plants (Asclepias genus) are noted for their unique and complicated flower structure, the thick milky juice which oozes from broken stems and leaves, their long pointed seedpods, and the almost magnetic attractiveness of their flowers to visiting butterflies and moths.  

Alternate leaves (to 2-6” long) of tall green milkweed (most milkweed species have opposite leaves) have a very narrow-linear to linear-lanceolate shape.  

Rounded, almost spherical, 2-inch diameter umbels, each containing 30-100 tiny, purple-tinged-greenish-white flowers (to 1/8” across), develop in the middle to upper leaf axils in late June-August.  Each individual flower has 5 sepals (lobed calyx), 5 petals (lobed corolla), and 5 upright cup-like hoods (horns absent).  The reflexed 5-lobed corolla curves backward and downward toward the center of the umbel, displaying the 5 hoods which are in general a key diagnostic feature of milkweed family plants.  Flowers are followed by smooth narrow seedpods (4-5” long) which split open when ripe to release numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind.   

Tall green milkweed is distinguished from many of the other species of milkweed by its narrow alternate leaves, greenish-white flower umbels, absence of horns in the flower hoods, and its very floriferous bloom.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means rather hairy.Common names are in reference to plant size and typical habitat.

It should be noted that the monarch butterfly, possibly the best known butterfly in North America, needs milkweed plants in order to survive.  Monarchs migrate into the U.S. from Mexico in spring to lay their eggs on milkweed species plants.  Caterpillars hatch from the eggs and consume the milkweed plant foliage as food for growth and development.  Mature caterpillars next spin a chrysalis which hangs on a milkweed stem until it later emerges, through the miracle of metamorphosis, as an adult butterfly.   Flower nectar is consumed by adult butterflies as a valuable food source.  The adult butterfly eventually migrates into Mexico for winter.  Recent significant declines in monarch butterfly populations in North America are believed by many experts to be related to a corresponding significant decline in milkweed plants which in large part has been caused by an increased use of glyphosate herbicides around food crop areas where glyphosate-tolerant (Roundup Ready) crops are being grown.

Culture
Easily grown in medium to wet soils in full sun. Surprisingly tolerant of average well-drained soils in cultivation even though the species is native to swamps and wet meadows. Plants have deep taproots and are best left undisturbed once established. Foliage is slow to emerge in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias incarnata, commonly called swamp milkweed, is an erect, clump-forming, Missouri native plant which is commonly found in swamps, river bottomlands and wet meadows throughout the State. It typically grows 3-4' tall (less frequently to 5') on branching stems. Small, fragrant, pink to mauve flowers (1/4"" wide), each with five reflexed petals and an elevated central crown, appear in tight clusters (umbels) at the stem ends in summer. Flowers are uncommonly white. Narrow, lance-shaped, taper-pointed leaves are 3-6"" long. Stems exude a toxic milky sap when cut. Flowers are followed by attractive seed pods (to 4"" long) which split open when ripe releasing silky-haired seeds easily carried by the wind. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies as a nectar source. In addition, swamp milkweed is an important food source (albeit somewhat less important than upland species of Asclepias) for the larval stage of Monarch butterflies.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means flesh-colored.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias purpurascens, commonly called purple milkweed, is a rough, weedy, Missouri native perennial that commonly occurs in dry to moist open woods, dry ridge tops, thickets, glades, prairie openings, stream banks and wet meadows throughout most of the state (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to common milkweed (A. syriaca), except its flowers are deep rose pink and its leaves are more pointed. It typically grows 2-3’ tall on stout, upright stems with heavy, pointed, short-stalked, ovate to oblong-lanceolate, opposite leaves (to 8” long). Leaves are dark green above and slightly pubescent below. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Tiny, deep rose-pink flowers appear in many-flowered umbels in May-July. Each tiny flower (to 3/4” long) has 5 reflexed petals and 5 purple heads. Flowers give way to smooth seed pods (to 6” long) which split open when ripe releasing their numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars).Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means purple.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias quadrifolia, commonly known as whorled milkweed or four-leaf milkweed, is an upright single-stemmed herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 1-2 1/2’ tall.  It is native to dry, rocky, open woods, often inhabiting slopes and ridges, from New Hampshire to Ontario to Minnesota south to Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia.  

Milkweed plants (Asclepias genus) are particularly noted for their unique and complicated flower structure, the thick milky juice which oozes from broken stems and leaves, their long pointed seedpods, and the almost magnetic attractiveness of their flowers to butterflies and moths.  

Whorled milkweed leaves (to 2-6” long) are egg-shaped to lanceolate.  Mid-stem leaves typically appear in one or two whorls of 4 with opposite pairs of leaves often appearing both above and below the whorled leaves.  Tiny fragrant flowers (each to 1/4” long) bloom late May to July in hemispherical terminal umbels.  Each flower has 5 sepals (lobed calyx), 5 purplish-pink petals (lobed corolla) and 5 cup-like white hoods with incurved horns protruding from each hood.  The 5-lobed corolla curves backward and downward toward the center of the umbel, displaying the 5 hoods which are in general a key diagnostic feature of milkweed family plants.  Flowers give way to smooth, narrow seed pods (to 3” long) which split open when ripe to release numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning leaves in fours in reference to the mid-stem leaves of this species which typically appear in whorls of four.Common names of four-leaved milkweed or whorled milkweed are also in obvious reference to the mid-stem leaf whorls.

It should be noted that the monarch butterfly, possibly the best known butterfly in North America, needs milkweed plants in order to survive.  Monarchs migrate into the U.S. from Mexico in spring to lay their eggs on milkweed species plants.  Caterpillars hatch from the eggs and consume the milkweed plant foliage as food for growth and development.

Once established, it is best to leave plants undisturbed because they develop deep taproots which make transplanting difficult.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias speciosa, commonly called showy milkweed, is a rough, weedy perennial which commonly occurs on dry slopes, open woodland areas, roadsides, waste areas and along streams in western North America. It typically grows 2-4' tall on stout, upright stems with velvety, broad-oblong to broad-ovate, gray-green leaves (to 8"" long) with conspicuous veining. Globular clusters (umbels to 3"" across) of fragrant, pinkish-white to pinkish-purple, star-like flowers appear mostly in the upper leaf axils over a long bloom period from late spring well into summer. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Flowers give way to prominent, rough seed pods (2-3"" long) which split open when ripe releasing their numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars).Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means showy.

Plants are easily grown from seed, but are somewhat slow to establish and may take 2-3 years to produce flowers. Mature plants may freely self-seed in the landscape if seed pods are not removed prior to splitting open. Butterfly weed does not transplant well due to its deep taproot, and is probably best left undisturbed once established.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias tuberosa, commonly called butterfly weed, is a tuberous rooted, Missouri native perennial which occurs in dry/rocky open woods, glades, prairies, fields and roadsides throughout the State (Steyermark). It typically grows in a clump to 1-3' tall and features clusters (umbels) of bright orange to yellow-orange flowers atop upright to reclining, hairy stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Unlike many of the other milkweeds, this species does not have milky-sapped stems. Flowers give way to prominent, spindle-shaped seed pods (3-6"" long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Long bloom period from late spring throughout the summer. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars). Also commonly called pleurisy root in reference to a prior medicinal use of the plant roots to treat lung inflammations.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means tuberous in reference to the roots.

Plants will spread by rhizomes but are not considered invasive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias verticillata, commonly known as whorled milkweed, is an upright perennial that typically grows to 2.5’ tall on simple, usually unbranched stems clad with long, narrow, sessile, needle-like, linear leaves (each 2-3” long) with revolute margins arranged in whorls of 3 to 6 at each node along the length of the stems.  Stems ooze a milky sap when cut or broken.  This plant is native to glades, dry prairies, dry slopes, dry open woods, pastures, fields and roadsides in a large part of central and eastern North America extending from Massachusetts to Ontario and Saskatchewan south to Arizona and Florida.  In Missouri it is commonly found throughout the State except in the bootheel area. 

Flowers bloom in small clusters (umbellate cymes of 3-20 flowers) in the upper leaf axils and stem ends between June and September.  Flowers are fragrant.  Each tiny flower (to 1/4” long) has a 5 lobed calyx, 5 greenish-white corolla lobes and 5 white hoods with incurved horns protruding from each hood.  Flowers give way to smooth, narrow seed pods (to 3” long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. 

Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements.  

Monarch butterflies need milkweed plants (Asclepias genus) in order to survive.  Monarchs lay their eggs on milkweed plants, caterpillars hatch from the eggs and consume the plant foliage as food for growth and development, and the flower nectar is consumed as a valuable source of food by adult monarchs.  Recent significant declines in monarch butterfly populations in North America are believed by many experts to be related to a corresponding significant decline in milkweed plants which in large part has been caused by an increased use of glyphosate herbicides around food crop areas where glyphosate-tolerant (Roundup Ready) crops are being grown.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word verticillatus meaning whorled in reference to the leaves appearing in whorls.Common name suggests this plant is noted for its whorled leaves and milky sap.  Additional common names for this plant include horsetail milkweed.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias viridis, commonly called green or green-flowered milkweed, is an erect to sometimes decumbent glabrous perennial that grows to 20-30"" tall on usually upright stems clad with mostly alternate, short-stalked, pointed, ovate-lanceolate, pale green leaves (to 2-5” long). Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. It is native to glades, prairies, pastures, fields and roadsides from Ohio to Nebraska south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri it is commonly found in the Ozarks and southeastern corner of the State (Steyermark). Tiny green flowers with purple hoods bloom in many-flowered axillary and terminal umbels from May to June. Each tiny flower (to 1” long) has 5 upright pale green corolla lobes (petals) and 5 purple hoods. Horns are absent. Flowers give way to seed pods (to 5” long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Flowers are a nectar source for many butterflies, and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars). Additional common names include green antelope horn (curved green seedpod resembles an antelope horn) and spider milkweed (white crab spider lives on this plant).Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet from Latin means green in reference to flower color.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Asimina triloba, commonly called pawpaw, is a Missouri native small understory tree or large shrub which typically grows 15-20' tall (sometimes to 30') and occurs in low bottom woods, wooded slopes, ravines and along streams. Often spreads by root suckers to form colonies or thickets. Large, slightly drooping, elliptical, medium green leaves (6-12"" long) retain green color well into fall before turning to a bright (but sometimes undistinguished) yellow. Cup-shaped, purple flowers (3 green sepals and 6 purple petals in two tiers) appear in spring, and give way to edible, oblong, yellowish green fruits which mature in early autumn to a dark brown. Flavor and fleshy consistency of the sweet-flavored fruits resembles bananas. Fruits are frequently eaten raw or used in ice creams or pies, although they can produce nausea in some people. Wildlife (e.g., raccoons, squirrels and opossums) eagerly seek out the fruits and often beat humans to the harvest. Early Americans made a yellow dye from the pulp of the ripened fruit.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the French form of the Indian name for this North American genus.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun. Prefers organically rich soils that are evenly moist. Usually planted from roots (crowns). Roots take 2-3 years to produce a crop. May also be grown from seed, but this requires more expertise and care and takes about one year longer to produce the first crop. Plant roots or seed in early spring. Important to keep bed free of weeds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asparagus is a perennial vegetable that produces edible shoots or spears which may be harvested in April-May. Plants are male or female. Males do not have to expend energy in producing flowers and fruit and typically produce better crop yields. Plants eventually grow into towering ferns in the summer and then die off after frost and are dormant during the winter. Female plants produce red berries in late summer that will drop in autumn and can cause self-seeding problems.Genus name is the classical name of this plant.Specific epithet means sold in shops and was applied to plants with supposed medicinal properties
","
Problems
Asparagus beetles and Japanese beetles can be a problem in some areas of the U.S., but rarely of such magnitude as to require pesticide applications. Susceptible to asparagus rust (Puccinia asparagi). Rabbits tend to avoid this plant.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-12 where it is easily grown in rich, moderately fertile, evenly moist, well-drained sandy loams in full sun to part shade.  Best in part shade.  Intolerant of frost, with plants dying to the ground in light freezes.  Easily grown as a houseplant in St. Louis because it tolerates a wide range of temperatures, does not require high humidity and is easily pruned.  Houseplants are best grown in well-drained, peaty/soil-based potting mixtures.  Site containers in bright indirect light or filtered sun, but avoid direct hot afternoon sun which may cause the leaves to yellow.  Water regularly from spring to autumn.  Does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering over the winter months.  This plant may be taken outside for the growing season and brought back inside in early fall.  Pinch back stem tips as needed to maintain plant form and promote dense foliage growth.  If plant loses its attractive shape, stems may be cut back to the soil to regenerate.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asparagus setaceus, commonly called asparagus fern, is not in fact a fern.  It is a bushy, evergreen, twining vine with wiry, spiny, scrambling or climbing stems that typically grow to 10-20' long.  It features feathery, fern-like flattened sprays of bright green stems, small white summer flowers and deep purple berries.  The true leaves of this plant are tiny dry scales.  The structures which appear to be leaves are flattened shoots (modified stems) called cladodes or cladophylls on which the flowers and fruits are borne.   Cladophylls rise from the axil between the stem and the scale-like leaf.  Mature stems become woody over time and develop sharp spines.  This vine is native to South Africa, but has been introduced in subtropical areas around the world.  It has shown weedy tendencies in some locations.  

Synonymous with Asparagus plumosus and Protasparagus setaceus.Genus name is the classical name of this plant.

Best grown in light, humusy, moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates part shade.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Not well adapted to the hot and humid summer climates of the deep South.   Plants go deciduous (fade from the landscape) in summer after bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asphodelus albus, commonly known as white-flowered asphodel, is an herbaceous perennial which typically grows to 2-4’ tall with a spread to 2 1/2’ wide.  It is native to the Mediterranean region from Spain to the Balkans and in northern Africa (primarily Libia).    

Glaucous, linear, flat-but-keeled, somewhat fleshy, grass-like, blue green leaves (to 30” long and 7/8” wide) rise up from fleshy thickened roots to form a basal clump of foliage.  Leafless flowering stems bear racemes of star-shaped, hermaphroditic, funnel-shaped, pink-veined white flowers (each flower to 1 5/8” diameter with 6 elongated petals/tepals) which bloom in mid to late spring (April – June).  Flowers are followed by egg-shaped, yellow-green seed capsules (3/8” long).Genus name comes from the Greek name for the true asphodel, Asphodelus ramosus and allied species.Specific epithet from Latin means white in reference to flower color.In Greek mythology, the asphodel flower (species decisions were not made in those days) was associated with mourning, the underworld and death.   The souls of most deceased people went to Asphodel Fields which was the resting place for the mass of ordinary individuals who lived average lives.  Asphodel was once believed to be a favorite food of the dead.   In a more modern vein, Professor Snape informs Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone that powered root of asphodel is an ingredient in a sleeping potion known as the Draught of Living Death.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where plants may be grown outside in the ground in warm, bright but shady locations in humus-rich, moist but well-drained soils with added leaf mold, sand and grit.  Avoid direct sun.  Ferns grown outside prefer minimum temperatures of 50 degrees F., but will usually tolerate occasional brief temperature dips into the high 30s.  

In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant.  It performs best in a porous, well-drained, peaty potting mixture in bright filtered light.  Avoid direct sun or dense shade locations.  It does best in warm, moderately bright areas of the home, but tolerates some shade.  Grows well in bright north-facing windows.  Keep soils uniformly moist.  Fairly high humidity is needed, which is a condition that can sometimes be difficult to achieve indoors in winter.  Good plant sites include humidified areas, bathrooms or atop wet-pebbled trays.  Avoid handling the somewhat delicate fronds.  Indoor plants generally seem to have less tolerance for temperatures that dip below 50 degrees F. than plants grown in the ground outdoors.  Ideal indoor temperatures are 60-70 degrees F. with a minimum of 55 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asplenium nidus, commonly called bird’s nest fern, is a slow-growing, epiphytic fern of the spleenwort family featuring simple, entire, strap-shaped, glossy, bright apple green fronds with contrasting dark brown to black midribs and undulating margins.  Fronds spread upward and outward to form a vase-shaped, green rosette with a nest-like center (albeit memorialized by some as resembling a bird’s nest) into which fallen leaves and other organic matter typically accumulate.  Mature fronds on outdoor plants grow to as much as 4-5’ long with a spread to 8” wide, but fronds on indoor container plants typically grow to only 1 1/2'  to 2’ long.  Undersides often display sori (clusters of sporangia) arranged in herringbone fashion in straight black lines from the central mid-rib to the frond margin.   

Species plants are native to tropical areas from Polynesia and Hawaii west to Southeast Asia, Australia, and Madagascar.  They are often found growing on tropical rainforest trees as epiphytes which collect water and organic matter in their bowl-shaped rosettes.Genus name comes from the Greek and means ""without a spleen"", possibly in reference to the believe that certain species of this plant could treat problems of the spleen.Specific epithet means nest in obvious reference to the nest-like structure formed by the rosette of overlapping fronds.Common name of bird’s nest fern is in reference to the aforementioned nest formed by the fronds which arguably resembles a bird’s nest.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs and scale.  Drafts may cause fronds to brown at the edges.  Chemical insecticides will damage plants (use soaps if necessary). Mealybugs.  Bacterial leaf diseases.  Leaf nematode is also common.
","
Garden Uses
Noted for its shape and distinctive glossy bright green leaves.  A single fern has good specimen value.  Where winter hardy, it may be grown outdoors in the ground or as an epiphyte on tree trunks.  Excellent houseplant for indoor areas with good indirect light and respectable humidity.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asplenium scolopendrium, commonly called hart’s tongue fern, is a rhizomatous, evergreen fern that typically produces an erect-arching clump of tongue-shaped, leathery, bright green fronds (12-18” long) which may have wavy margins. Sori are arranged on the frond undersides in rows that purportedly resemble the many legs of a centipede (skolopenda meaning centipede in Greek). Primarily native to Europe, although there exists a rare American variety (Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum) that reportedly may be found in a very limited number of sites in Alabama, Tennessee, Michigan, New York and Ontario. The American variety is currently classified as threatened in its entire range. Plants sold in commerce are the European variety.

Formerly included in the genus Phyllitis and is synonymous with Phyllitis scolopendrium.Genus name comes from the Greek and means ""without a spleen"", possibly in reference to the believe that certain species of this plant could treat problems of the spleen.Specific epithet means millipede an allusion to the rows of sori.Common name is in reference to the supposed resemblance of the frond shape to a deer’s tongue.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot can be a problem in poorly drained soils.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aster alpinus, commonly called alpine aster, is native to the mountains of Europe, including the Alps and Pyrenees.  It typically grows in a slowly-spreading clump to 8-12"" tall.   Daisy-like asters (to 1"" diameter) featuring blue-violet rays and yellow centers bloom in May-June.  Flowers are usually solitary, appearing at the ends of slender stems.  Untoothed,  lanceolate-spatulate, dark green leaves (to 2” long) are mostly basal.  Flowers are attractive to butterflies.  Aster alpinus var. vierhapperi, commonly called Vierhapper's aster, is native to the Altai Mountains in central Asia (primary range) plus Alaska and northwestern Canada, with several small disjunct populations in Idaho, Colorado and Wyoming.Genus name comes from the Latin word aster meaning star for the shape of the flowers.Specific epithet means alpine; from high mountains above the timber line.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems.  Asters generally have some susceptibility to powdery mildew.  Aster wilt can also be an occasional problem, particularly if plants are grown in poorly-drained clay soils.  Watch for slugs and snails.
","
Garden Uses
This aster is native to rocky soils and will do well in similar soils in sunny areas of rock gardens or border fronts.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Good drainage is essential.  Plants generally do not need staking due to compact size.  Planting, transplanting and division (every 4-5 years) should be done in spring.  Not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where it may be advisable to grow these plants in protected locations with spent flowering stems left in place over winter.  A light winter mulch will also help protect crowns.  Cut stems to the ground in early spring before new growth appears.  Wet soils in winter can be fatal.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aster amellus, commonly known as Italian aster or Italian starwort, is a compact bushy aster that typically grows to 2-2.5’ tall and as wide.  It is native to sunny limestone slopes in central France, northern Italy, the Czech Republic and the Caucasus.  Species plants are now rare in the wild.  Daisy-like flowers (each to 2.5” diameter) with purple rays (20-30 narrow petals) and yellow center disks bloom from late summer/early autumn to frost, singly or in flattened clusters (corymbs), atop erect pubescent stems rising to 2.5’ tall.  Rough, hairy, lanceolate leaves (to 5” long) are medium to deep green.  Petiolate basal leaves are oblanceolate to obovate and sessile stem leaves are oblong to lanceolate.Genus name comes from the Latin word aster meaning star for the shape of the flowers.Specific epithet comes from the River Mella in Italy which is a tributary of the Po.‘Veilchenkonigin’, commonly sold under the trade name of VIOLET QUEEN, produces deep violet-purple flowers from late summer to early fall (sometimes to first frost).  Flowers are borne in profusion on stems growing to 2’ tall.  Plants have a loose, bushy, open habit.  

Although once marketed under the cultivar name of ‘Violet Queen’, this plant is now called ‘Veilchenkonigin’ (original German name given by Karl Foerster in 1956) with VIOLET QUEEN as the trade name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Crown rot may occur in wet, poorly drained soils, particularly in winter.  Verticillium wilt may attack plants grown in poor soils.  Good resistance to powdery mildew, particularly if soils remain somewhat dry.

Culture
Easily grown in average, well-drained soils of medium moisture in full sun. Good air circulation helps reduce incidence of foliar diseases. May be grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aster sedifolius is native to Europe. It is a clump forming aster that features terminal sprays of 1.25” diameter asters (bluish-lilac rays with yellow centers) on generally weak stems rising 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall. This species, sometimes commonly called Rhone aster, is infrequently sold in commerce because of the availability of the compact cultivar ‘Nanus’.Genus name comes from the Latin word aster meaning star for the shape of the flowers.‘Nanus’ typically grows to only 18” tall and features flowers that are slightly smaller than the species with ray flowers that are a darker blue. Lance-shaped, medium green leaves (to 2.5” long). Blooms from late summer to early fall. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Asters in general have some susceptibility to powdery mildew. Aster wilt can also be an occasional problem, particularly if plants are grown in poorly-drained clay soils. Taller plants may require staking or other support. Foliage tends to decline by late summer to early fall.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium to wet but well-drained soils in part shade.  May tolerate full sun only in temperate climates with consistently moist soils.  Soils must be kept uniformly moist and not allowed to dry out.  Best performance occurs in cool summer climates where night temperatures consistently dip below 70F degrees, which unfortunately is a cultural preference that does not fit the profile of a typical St. Louis summer where this plant often labors.  In optimum growing conditions, plants will spread by stolons and/or self-seeding in a non-invasive manner to form colonies.   Deadhead flowerheads after bloom if self-seeding is unwanted (deadheading may also prolong bloom).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Astrantia major, commonly called greater masterwort, is an upright, umbelliferous, stoloniferous, herbaceous perennial (carrot family) that is native to mountain meadows, grasslands, woodland clearings and moist areas near streams in Europe and western Asia.  Each flowerhead (2-3"" diameter) features dense, compact, domed umbels of tiny greenish-white flowers which form a delicate pincushion-like center subtended by a showy collar of papery, petal-like, creamy white involucral bracts.  Flowers bloom late spring to early summer atop wiry, branched, nearly leafless stems rising to 24"" tall above an 18"" tall basal clump of deeply divided deep green leaves (3-6"" long) which are palmately cut into 3 to 7 (usually 5) toothed lobes.Genus name comes from a Greek word astron meaning star in reference to the flower head shape or from magistrantia (derived from the Latin word magister meaning master or teacher).Specific epithet means bigger or larger.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs are occasional visitors.
","
Garden Uses
Part shade areas of perennial borders.  Also effective in open woodland, wild or cottage gardens.  Good perennial for sun-dappled areas below open trees.  Often thrives along moist stream banks (above water level).  Plants will spread to fill in open spaces in woodland gardens, but are not considered invasive.  May form colonies over time.  Excellent for dried flower arrangements.

Culture
Easily grown in rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Tolerates drier soils than many other ferns. Will tolerate full sun, however, only if soil is kept constantly moist. Shelter from wind to protect fronds from breaking. Divide clumps in spring every few years to reposition crowns at the soil level.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Athyrium filix-femina, commonly called lady fern, is a deciduous fern that features lacy-cut, erect or ascending, 2 to 3-pinnate or pinnatifid, finely-divided, lanceolate, light green fronds which grow in a dense circular shuttlecock-like clump to 2-3' tall.  Each frond (leaf) has twenty to thirty pairs of elliptic non-opposite pinna (leaflets) with narrow pointed tips.  Each pinna is divided into deeply-cut lanceolate to oblong pinnules (subleaflets).  Sori and indusia are found on the undersides of the pinnules.  This is a circumglobal species which is found in rich moist woods, thickets, fields, meadows and ravines throughout northern North America, Europe and Asia.Genus name comes from Greek athyros meaning ""doorless"" in reference to the slowly opening hinged indusia (spore covers).Specific epithet comes from Latin filix meaning fern and femina meaning woman as confirmed by the common name of lady fern.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Fronds frequently become somewhat tattered in appearance by mid summer.
","
Garden Uses
Great selection for a shady area of the landscape in need of a small but easy-to-grow fern.  Rock gardens, woodland gardens, shaded border fronts or shade gardens.  Also effective in shaded areas along streams or ponds.

Culture
Spring seed thickly directly in rows 1-1/2 ' to 2-1/2 ' apart as early as ground can be worked, with successive plantings every 20 to 30 days to insure a tender crop. Thin to 6 to 10"" apart. Water and fertilize to insure quick and tender growth. Start harvesting leaves when plants are about 1"" high. While mountain spinach can withstand adverse conditions and heat, they will tend to bolt (produce a seed head) and be less palatable. Can be kept low by clipping.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Atriplex hortensis, commonly called mountain spinach, closely resembles lambs quarters. It is a mild and tender salad green if grown quickly and harvested when 6"" tall and under. On larger plants pick only small tender leaves. Red, green, and white cultivars are available. The cultivar 'Red Orach' does not lose color when cooked. Mature seed pods are used as a dried floral decoration.Genus name comes from the Greek named for orach, a species of this genus of herbs and shrubs which can be used like spinach.Specific epithet means of or pertaining to gardens.
","
Problems
Tends to run to seed.
","
Garden Uses
Raw in salads or as a cooked green.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA  Zones 7-9 where this shrub is best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Plants need significant amounts of shade in hot summer climates (young leaves will often burn in full sun).  Established plants have very good drought tolerance.  Plants tolerate average to nutritionally poor soils and most city air pollutants.  Avoid overly moist to wet soils.  Site in locations protected from strong winds, particularly near the northern edge of the growing range.  Plants will generally tolerate temperatures to -5 degrees F., which means they may survive in some Zone 6 plantings particularly in sheltered locations.  Easily propagated by cuttings or from seed.  Take cuttings from both male and female plants (plants are dioecious), and label them by sex in order to ensure that the female plants in a new planting will be pollinated by a nearby male for purposes of bearing fruit.  Plants grown in containers may be left outdoors year round in warm winter areas, brought indoors in winter in cold winter areas, or grown year round as houseplants.  Container plants require consistent moisture when placed outside in summer with monthly applications of a liquid fertilizer, but should be given less water in winter.  Indoor plants require a cool room with temperatures in the 50-65 degree F. range.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aucuba japonica, commonly called spotted laurel, is a rounded, shade-loving, evergreen shrub in the Garryaceae family, a small family that includes just two genera Garrya and Aucuba.  It typically grows to 6-10' (infrequently to 15') tall, unless pruned shorter.  Native to moist woodland areas, thickets, valleys and along streams from Japan and China to the Himalayas.  Coreaceous (leathery), glossy, elliptic to narrow-ovate, medium to rich green leaves (each to 8” long) have coarse marginal teeth on the upper half of each leaf.  Tiny purple-maroon flowers with creamy white anthers bloom in early spring (March-April).  Each flower has four sepals and four petals.  Plants in this genus are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants).  Male flowers appear in upright terminal panicles (cymes to 4 1/2” long).  Female flowers appear in shorter clusters from the leaf axils.  Pollinated female flowers are followed by ellipsoid, one-seeded, berry-like drupes (to 1/2”) which ripen to red in fall.  Fruits often persist on the plant until spring.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Japanese name aukubi for these shrubs.Specific epithet means native to Japan.
","
Problems
Generally easy to grow.  Root rot may occur in poorly-drained or overly-wet soils.  Watch for winter dieback in cold winter areas.  Southern blight.  Fungal leaf spot.  Potential insect problem are nematodes, scale and mealybugs.  Spider mites can be troublesome indoors.
","
Garden Uses
Hedge.  Screen.  Background.  Tubs, planters and containers for patios and terraces.  Window boxes.  Indoor houseplant for cool rooms.

Culture
Grow in dry, average to sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid heavy clay soils. Rots may develop in moist or poorly-drained soils. Best flowering is in full sun, however plant foliage appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Cut back plants up to 1/2 after flowering to help maintain attractive form. In hot and humid summer climates such as the St. Louis area, this plant is difficult to grow well and can be very short-lived. In the deep South, many gardeners simply grow it in the manner of an annual by planting new plants each fall, enjoying the spring bloom and then removing the plants as the foliage depreciates in summer. New plants are commonly sold in early spring by nurseries. Seed may be planted in the garden in early fall or may be started indoors in late winter from 8-10 weeks before planting outside.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aurinia saxatilis commonly called basket-of-gold is a low-growing, spreading perennial that produces a profuse spring bloom of bright yellow flowers that are particularly attractive in rock gardens, sprawled over rocks or cascaded over rock walls. After bloom, it will remain in the garden as an attractive ground cover unless the foliage depreciates or plants die back from hot summer conditions. It is native from central Europe to Turkey. This is a mat-forming perennial with woody roots that grows to 6-12” tall and features spatulate basal leaves (to 5” long) and smaller linear-oblanceolate stem leaves. Leaves are gray-green. Bright yellow flowers in corymbose panicles bloom in spring. 

Additional common names include yellow alyssum, madwort, goldentuft and gold-dust.

Synonymous with and formerly known as Alyssum saxatile.Genus name comes from the word aureus meaning golden in allusion to the flowers of A. saxatilis (formerly Alyssum saxatile).Specific epithet means found among rocks.
","
Problems
Watch for aphids. Plants are often short-lived in the St. Louis area.
","
Garden Uses
Rock gardens, beds, border fronts, hillsides, over rocks or atop stone walls. A good ground cover in summer areas where it does not burn out from high heat and humidity.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it is best grown in rich, acidic, evenly moist, well-drained loams in full sun. Best sited in locations sheltered from wind. Generally intolerant of frost. In St. Louis, it may be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors, but it may not bear fruit. Plants generally stop active growth when temperatures dip below 55 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Averrhoa carambola, commonly called star fruit is a small, slow-growing, short-trunked tropical tree that probably originated in Malaysia, Indonesia and southern China. It now extinct in the wild. It is grown commercially in many tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world for its unusual fruit. It also serves as an attractive, multi-branched ornamental tree. It typically grows to 20-30' tall with a broad rounded crown featuring odd-pinnate, medium green leaves (to 6-10"" long). Each leaf has 5-11 ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaflets (to 1.5-3.5"" long). Leaflets are sensitive to light and touch, folding up like mimosas in the dark of night or if disturbed. Fragrant rose flowers (1/4"" across) bloom in the leaf axils throughout the year, typically in up to four separate flushes. Flowers give way to waxy, oblong/ellipsoidal, 5-angled, orange/yellow-skinned fruits (3-6"" long) which are star-shaped when sliced in cross-section, hence the common name. Fruit flesh is juicy and ranges from sour to mildly sweet when ripe. Fruits are typically eaten fresh, combined in salads with other fruits, added to dessert dishes or sliced for use as star-shaped garnishes.Genus name comes from the fruit trees named after a celebrated Moorish physician and philosopher Ibn-Ruschd known as Averroes (1126-1198) who was born in Cordoba, Spain.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot may develop in overly moist soils. Anthracnose, leaf spots and sooty mold may also occur. Potential insect pests include fruit flies, beetles, caterpillars, nematodes, scale and stinkbugs.
","
Garden Uses
Fruit tree or small ornamental shade tree for frost free areas. Interesting container plant for colder areas. Bonsai.

Culture
This tropical tree is intolerant of temperatures below 40 degrees F. It is best grown in tropical to subtropical areas in deep, sandy, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. It is noted for having excellent drought tolerance. It may be grown indoors in containers where its size can be controlled by pruning. Container plants generally have less drought tolerance than plants grown in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Azadirachta indica, commonly called neem tree or margosa tree, is native to tropical, dry, deciduous/evergreen forests of Burma, India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), but has for many years been cultivated throughout India, Malaysia and Pakistan. It is a medium sized tree that grows to 50-75' (less frequently to 100') tall with a dense, round to oval crown. It is evergreen, but may temporarily lose its leaves in protracted drought conditions. Compound pinnate leaves (6-12"") have 8-18 serrated medium to dark green leaflets (each to 3"" long). White fragrant flowers in drooping panicles to 10"" long bloom in spring. Trees are polygamous (both bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same plant). Edible fruit is a smooth olive-like drupe. Each fruit contains one (rarely 2-3) elongated seeds. Neem trees are sacred in their native land. Almost every part of the tree has some uses. Durable wood (mahagony family) is used for furniture and lumber. Leaves and bark are used in teas, cosmetics, toothpaste, pet care and medicinal preparations. Dried leaves are used to deter moth. Twigs are used as tooth brushes. Neem oil is a broad spectrum botanical insecticide, repellent and fungicide. It is also used for a variety of additional purposes including machinery lubricant, lamp fuel and for soaps and cosmetics. Neem cake is used as a fertilizer and a nematicide.Genus name is adapted from the ancient Persian name of azad-dazakht.Specific epithet means of India.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Trees can spread invasively by self seeding.
","
Garden Uses
Neem tree has been widely planted as a shade tree in hot, drought prone areas and has over time been introduced to tropical areas around the world. Interesting container plant for indoors.

Culture
Grow on still water in full sun to part shade. Scatter small bunches of plants on the water surface after last frost date. Spreads quickly in optimum conditions. Net out excess plants as needed. Can spread rapidly in frost-free climates. In the wild, it survives winter in cold weather climates by way of overwintering bodies that sink to the bottom in fall and rise to the surface in spring only after temperatures have warmed up. This phenomenon is usually not seen in home water gardens in the St. Louis area where it is recommended that some plants be lifted each year in fall before first frost and overwintered in a saucer of moist soil in a bright frost-free area or in an aquarium.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Azolla filiculoides, commonly called mosquito fern, is a deciduous, free-floating, aquatic perennial fern that forms rapidly expanding, moss-like mats of foliage (to 1/2” tall) on still water surfaces. In optimum conditions, the foliage becomes so dense as to reportedly prevent mosquito larva from developing and hatching, hence the common name. It is a popular addition to water gardens and ponds, where it not only provides attractive foliage cover but also discourages algae growth and helps keep waters clear. Foliage is bright green in shade, but develops attractive purplish-rose tints in full sun. All plants turn reddish-purple in fall as temperatures cool. Pinnately branched stems are densely clad with minute, often overlapped, two-lobed leaves (1/4” long) in two rows. Tiny roots trail downward from the lower surfaces of the stem forks. This fern is native to lakes, ponds, streams and rivers in both North and South America.Genus name comes from the Greek words azomeaning to dry and olluo meaning to kill. The plants will easily die when they become too dry.Specific epithet means resembling fern.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Free floating aquatic perennial for water gardens or ponds.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Baccharis angustifolia, also called false willow, is a large, upright shrub reaching 6-13' tall with a 4-10' spread. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it is found growing in brackish swamps and marshes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from North Carolina to Louisiana. The small, narrow leaves (1-2"" long) are slightly succulent with a single vein visible down the center. This plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate individuals. Sex of a plant cannot be determined until bloom time. Both the male and female flowers are small and not showy, blooming in clusters at the tips of the stems from September to November. The female plants can be identified by the cottony, white seed clusters common to many members of the aster family.Genus name in honor of Bacchus, the god of wine.The specific epithet angustifolia means narrow leaf.The common name refers to the narrow, willow-like foliage.
","
Problems
No known pest or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Use in a coastal garden, rain garden, or other natural garden spaces. This plant can reproduce readily from seed. For this reason, male plants are often preferred in the landscape over female plants.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where plants are easily grown in dry, sandy, medium to coarse, acidic to neutral, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Established plants generally perform well without supplemental watering, having good tolerance for heat, drought, wind and poor soils.  Female plants produce cottony seed clusters that are distributed to new locations by wind.  Propagate by seed, cuttings or bare root plantings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Baccharis pilularis, commonly known as chaparral broom, coyote brush or dwarf chaparral false willow, is an evergreen shrub that typically grows in two different forms, namely, as (1) a prostrate, mat-forming, evergreen groundcover shrub to 8-24” tall spreading to 6’ wide or more, or (2) an upright-rounded shrub to 4-8’ tall and as wide.  It is native to the western U. S. where it is primarily found on sea cliffs, bluffs, sand dunes, foothills and thickets in the outer coastal ranges from Mexico and Baja California north to Oregon.  It prefers open, dry sites.  It is distinguished by its dark brown stems clad with serrate, sticky-coated, obovate to oblanceolate green leaves (each 1/2 to 3/4” long).  This shrub is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with the yellowish male flowers producing pollen and the pollinated white female flowers producing fruit (cottony seed clusters).  Flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, but are not particularly ornamental.  Sex of a plant cannot be determined until bloom time.  Typically, only male plants are cultivated for home use because they lack the cottony seed clusters which some gardeners consider to be distracting and messy additions to the landscape.Genus name in honor of Bacchus, the god of wine.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pilulifera meaning having small little fruits in reference to the cottony orbicular seed clusters found on female plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Black mold and rust may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent ground cover for arid, low-maintenance areas of the Western U.S.   Bank stabilizer.  Informal evergreen hedge.  Fire-retardant cover for large areas and building peripheries.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates drought and poor soils. Over time, plants form slowly expanding clumps with deep and extensive root systems, and should not be disturbed once established. Difficult to grow from seed and slow to establish. Plants take on more of a shrubby appearance and tend to open up after bloom. Trimming or shearing foliage after bloom helps maintain rounded plant appearance and obviates any need for staking, but eliminates the developing seed pods which are so attractive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Baptisia alba commonly called white false indigo, is an upright perennial which typically grows 2-3’ tall and occurs in dry woods from Tennessee and North Carolina to Florida. It features small, white, pea-like flowers (to 1/2” long) in erect racemes (to 12”) atop dark flower stems extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, bluish-green leaves (leaflets to 2” long). Blooms in spring. Flowers give way to inflated seed pods (to 1 3/4” long) which turn brown to black when ripe and have considerable ornamental interest. Stems with seed pods are valued additions to dried flower arrangements.The genus name Baptisia comes from the Greek word bapto meaning ""to dye"".Specific epithet means white.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Baptisia australis, commonly called blue false indigo, is an upright perennial which typically grows 3-4' tall and occurs in rich woods, thickets and along streambanks from Pennsylvania south to North Carolina and Tennessee. It features purple, lupine-like flowers in erect racemes (to 12"") atop flower spikes extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, bluish-green leaves (leaflets to 2"" long). Blooms in spring. Flowers give way to inflated seed pods (to 2.5"" long) which turn charcoal black when ripe and have considerable ornamental interest. Seeds rattle around in the blackened pods which were once popularly used by children as rattles. Stems with seed pods are valued additions to dried flower arrangements.The genus name Baptisia comes from the Greek word bapto meaning ""to dye"".Specific epithet means southern.The common name of false indigo refers to the use of certain native baptisias by early American colonists as a substitutes, albeit inferior, for true indigo (genus Indigofera) in making dyes.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Baptisia sphaerocarpa, commonly called false indigo (or yellow wild indigo) is an upright, mounded perennial that typically grows 2-3’ tall. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers (to 1/2” long) in erect racemes (to 12-15”) atop yellowish-green flower stems extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, blue-green leaves (leaflets to 2” long). Blooms in spring. Flowers give way to inflated spherical seed pods (to 3/4” diameter) that turn tan to brown when ripe and have considerable ornamental interest. Stems with seed pods are valued additions to dried flower arrangements. Steyermark reports that this species is unique among the species of Baptisia found in Missouri by having leaves on the smaller branches with only 1-2 leaflets. The current range of this species appears to be Louisiana to Texas north to Missouri and Oklahoma, however it is not clear that it is indigenous to all of these areas. This plant was apparently introduced a number of years ago into certain prairie areas and along certain railroad tracks in five Missouri counties, and accordingly is not considered to be a native Missouri taxon (Steyermark).The genus name Baptisia comes from the Greek word bapto meaning ""to dye"".Specific epithet means with rounded fruit.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Tolerates drought and poor soils. Over time, plants form slowly expanding clumps with deep and extensive root systems, and should not be disturbed once established. Difficult to grow from seed and slow to establish. Plants take on more of a shrubby appearance and tend to open up after bloom. Light trimming or shearing foliage after bloom helps maintain rounded plant appearance and obviates any need for support, but eliminates the developing seed pods.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Baptisia tinctoria commonly called wild indigo or yellow wild indigo, is an upright, smooth, shrubby perennial which typically grows 2-3' tall and occurs in open woods and fields from Maine to Florida and west to Minnesota. It features small, bright yellow to cream, pea-like flowers (to 1/2"" long) in numerous, sparsely-flowered clusters (terminal racemes to 4-5"") on stems extending above a foliage mound of stalkless, clover-like, trifoliate, gray-green leaves (leaflets to 1"" long). Blooms in late spring to early summer. Flowers give way to small inflated seed pods which turn black when ripe and have some ornamental interest. Seeds rattle around in the pods when ripe, thus giving rise to the sometimes common name of rattleweed for this species. Used by early Americans as a substitute, albeit an inferior one, for true indigo (genus Indigofera) in making dyes.The genus name Baptisia comes from the Greek word bapto meaning ""to dye"".Specific epithet comes from the Latin word for dye.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, prairies, meadows and native plant gardens. Effective in naturalized settings. Best as a specimen or in small groups. May be used in borders, but flowers are smaller and less showy than many of the other baptisias.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small shrub (or subshrub) is typically found growing along roadsides, slopes, and streambanks, but also in some xeric sites.  Best growth typically occurs in dry to medium moisture well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Although drought tolerant, shrubs prefer moderate but even soil moisture.  Best flowering occurs with regular applications of fertilizer.  Propagate by seed or stem/tip cuttings.  Shrubs self sow in the landscape.  Prune to desired shape.  Cut back stems in spring (sometimes to the ground) to promote a bushy rounded growth.  Shrubs may survive winter in Zone 8, but to facilitate this climate, stems should be cut back to the ground when winter frosts kill the tops, with application of mulch to the root zone for winter (mound of sand covered with a layer of pine straw).  Mulch must be removed in late winter to early spring in anticipation of new growth for the year.  This shrub, even with a quality winter mulch, will not survive temperatures that dip below 20 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Barleria cristata, commonly known as Philippine violet, is a dense, upright, hairy-stemmed, subtropical, evergreen subshrub in the acanthus family that typically matures to 3-4’ tall with a spread to 2-3’ wide.  It is native from northern India and Myanmar (Burma) to southern China and Southeast Asia.  Potential growing areas in the U.S. for this shrub include Florida, southern Louisiana and Texas, southern Arizona and California.  Elliptic to narrow-ovate to oblong leaves (to 4” long and 2” wide) are dark green above and pale green beneath.  Funnel-shaped, 2-inch long flowers (pink, purple, white or mauve with white stripes) bloom in axillary spikes on new growth over a long flowering season from September to December plus mid-spring (May).  Flowers are followed by seedpods.Genus name honors Jacques Barrelier (1606-1673) French botanist and monk.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word cristatus meaning crested or with tassel-like tips.Common name of Philippine violet is a bit of an enigma because, although its flowers are arguably of violet color, the shrub has no relationship to the Philippine Islands or violets.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to bacterial leaf spot, fungal spots and stem galls.  Aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites may appear.

Culture
Grow in rich, fertile, moisture-retentive soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Easily grown from seed. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Seed may also be planted directly in the garden at the last spring frost date. Use a slow-release fertilizer. When grown as a vegetable, train it on a sturdy trellis or other support. When grown for ornamental purposes, grow it on a fence or lamppost or other structure. Plants may also be allowed to simply trail along the ground. Plants are intolerant of frost and do not perform well if summer temperatures consistently dip below 59 degrees F. at night.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Basella alba, commonly called Malabar spinach, is native to the East Indies. It is a vigorous, climbing, tropical vine that may be grown in St. Louis as (1) an annual leafy vegetable for cultivation of its edible spinach-like stems and leaves or (2) as an ornamental foliage vine.  This is a fast-growing tropical vine that, if trained on a support, will rise to 6' tall in a single season.  Although in a different family than spinach, the leaves taste like spinach and, unlike spinach, the plants thrive in hot summer weather.   Leaves and stems are a good source of Vitamins A and C, calcium and iron.  Small purple-white flowers may appear at the end of the summer (plants will not flower until daylight decreases to less than 12 hours per day).Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the vernacular name.Specific epithet means white.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
As a vegetable, pick leaves and stems as needed for use in soups, salads, stir-fry or as a pot herb for stews.  As an ornamental, enjoy the glossy green leaves and red stems in ornamental plantings on posts, fences, hanging baskets or large containers.

Easily grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Sow seed outdoors after last frost date. For earlier growth, sow seed indoors in pots about 4-6 weeks prior to last frost date. Site plants in locations protected from strong winds. Plants will self seed in the garden and can become somewhat weedy in USDA Zones 8-10. Propagate by seeds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bassia scoparia f. trichophylla, commonly called burning bush, is an upright, shrubby, warm weather annual that is primarily grown for its attractive shape, light green foliage and bright scarlet red fall color. It typically grows in a single season to 2-3’ (less frequently to 5’) tall with a globular to columnar habit. Branches are clad with feathery, narrow, light green leaves (2-3” long) that turn scarlet red in fall. Flowers are inconspicuous. Plants have a cypress-like form and soft foliage, hence the sometimes used common name of summer cypress. This plant is native to temperate Asia, but has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of North America. Synonymous with and formerly known as Kochia scoparia f. trachophylla and Kochia trichophylla.Genus name honors Ferdinando Bassi (1714-1774), Italian botanist and director of the Bologna botanic garden.Specific epithet means broom-like.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10 where it is best grown in sandy soils with sharp drainage in full sun. It is a very popular houseplant in more temperate climates. Houseplants should be placed in a sunny window. Plants like sunny, warm, dry conditions and overwinter well with furnace heat. Houseplants are best grown in relatively small pots with excellent drainage. Plants may be moved outdoors after last spring frost date with gradual adjustment to full sun locations and cooler temperatures. Fading leaves may be peeled off. Brown leaf tips may be clipped off. Outdoors in summer, plants should be given regular water but allowed to dry out between applications. Reduce watering for plants brought indoors for winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Beaucarnea recurvata, commonly called ponytail palm, is an evergreen caudiciform shrub or tree that is native to semi-desert areas of southeastern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala where it typically grows to as much as 30' tall. Where not winter hardy, it is commonly grown as a houseplant that over time will eventually rise to as much as 6-8' tall. Notwithstanding its common name, ponytail palm is not a true palm. It is noted for having a large, swollen, often flask-shaped, water-retaining base (caudex) from which rises a trunk-like stem bearing narrow, flat, palm-like, spreading to recurved leaves (to 6' long but only 1"" wide) that droop fountain-like in clusters from the branch ends. Trunks are usually single with young plants, but several smaller trunks as well as some sparse branching near the top may develop with age. Old plants may produce tiny creamy white flowers in clusters. Flowers rarely appear on houseplants.Genus name is of uncertain origin.Specific epithet means curved backwards.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Houseplants are susceptible to spider mites, mealybug and scale. Potential disease problems include leaf spots, stem rots and bacterial leaf streak.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent specimen in dry frost-free areas. Elsewhere ponytail palm makes an excellent houseplant that can be moved outdoors each year after the last spring frost date.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants prefer part shade in southern areas with hot summers. Plants are intolerant of drought. Although English daisy is a perennial, it is typically grown for ornamental purposes as a biennial in the South or as an annual in the North, with plants being dug up and thrown away after bloom. It is usually grown from seed. In the South (including St. Louis), seed is planted in fall or indoors in winter for bloom the following spring. By the heat of the summer, plants decline to the point where removal becomes appropriate. In the North, seed is planted in early spring for bloom in summer. In cool summer conditions (USDA Zones 4-5 and the West Coast), plants may spread aggressively by spreading crowns and self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bellis perennis, commonly called English daisy, has a varied reputation (depending in large part on geographical location) ranging from attractive low-spreading ornamental flower to common (sometimes detested) weed of lawns, fields and abandoned areas. Each plant features a sprawling, flattened rosette of small, spatula-shaped, dark green leaves to 1-2” tall. Daisies (to 2” diameter) with white rays and yellow centers bloom on pubescent stems rising to 3-6” tall. Young leaves may be eaten raw in salads or cooked. In the St. Louis area, plants are not considered to be lawn weeds, with best bloom occurring in spring when the mornings are cool. Plants typically burn out with summer heat. Native to Europe, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the northern U. S. and West Coast.Genus name comes from the Latin word bellus meaning pretty.Specific epithet means lasting through the year.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In cool summer areas, plants can spread and difficult to eradicate once established.
","
Garden Uses
In cool summer locations, English daisy has a number of different uses including beds, border fronts, rock gardens and wild flower areas where it may be naturalized without concern of spread. Also effective as a ground cover, edger or companion to spring bulbs. Excellent in containers.

Culture
This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. It is best grown in fertile, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Seeds may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have risen to at least 65 degrees F., typically around the date of last spring frost. Plant several seeds together in each planting site (seed hill) and thin later. Seed can also be started indoors about 3 weeks before the last spring frost date, with young plants set out after last frost date. Space young plants about 2' apart when growing upright or 5-6' apart when growing along the ground. If allowed to climb, this vine will need a strong trellis or other support. Immature young fruit can be picked for immediate use. Mature fruit needs a good wax coating to insure long storage time. Heavy fruits on upright stems may need net support. Store mature fruits on shelves or suspended in nets in cool (55-59 degree F.) and dry conditions for 3-6 months (sometimes as long as one year if properly stored).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Benincasa hispida, commonly called wax gourd or fuzzy gourd, is native to Southeast Asia. It is an annual creeping vine with branched tendrils that will climb structures (with some support), cover fences or sprawl along the ground. Although it has some ornamental value, it is primarily grown as a food plant. Coarse, prominently-furrowed, thick, hairy stems are clad with large, roughly-textured, 5-lobed leaves (4-10"" long). Golden yellow flowers (to 3 1/2"" wide) form in the leaf axils in early summer. Female flowers are followed by oblong to nearly spherical melon-like fruits which vary in appearance and uses depending on growth stage. Young fruits are often commonly called fuzzy gourd (particularly B. hispida var. chieh-qua) because they are covered with a soft down which eventually disappears as the fruits mature. White flesh is crisp and juicy. Young fruits are perishable (should be eaten within a week of being picked) and are typically used somewhat the same way as summer squash. They may be peeled, shredded or cut into chunks for baking, sauteeing or adding to soups. Mature fruits are commonly called winter melons because of the waxy coating which protects the fruit and allows for long-term storage. Winter melons typically range in size from 5-20 pounds in rounded shapes (to 12"" diameter) or in cylindrical shapes (to 15"" long), but in ideal conditions may grow much larger (to 25-50 pounds and to 4-6' long). Culinary uses for winter melons include boil as a vegetable, stuff-and-bake or add to soups.Genus name honors 16th century Italian botanist Giuseppe Benincasa (1535-1596), Italian botanist who founded the Botanic Garden in Pisa.Specific epithet from Latin means rough-hairy in reference to the pubescence found on the foliage and young fruits.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Blossom end rot, fusarium wilt, bacterial wilt, downy mildew and powdery mildew may appear. Potential insect pests include aphids, cucumber beetles, squash bugs, stink bugs, cutworms, pickleworm and squash vine boreres. Watch for mites.
","
Garden Uses
Harvest gourds for culinary use or grow as an ornamental vine. Scoup out insides and use shell as a soup receptacle.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates part shade, but performs best with full sun. This is a very adaptable shrub that is tolerant of urban conditions. Plants also tolerates heat and drought, but are generally intolerant of poorly-drained, wet soils. Plants spread slowly by creeping roots. Plants can also spread by self-seeding (birds will eat the fruits and distribute the seed). Plant branches may root where they touch the ground. This species is considered to be highly invasive in some areas (particularly in eastern North America).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Berberis thunbergii, commonly called Japanese barberry, is a spiny, broad-rounded, deciduous shrub with obovate green leaves.  It typically matures to 5' tall and as wide.  Leaves (variably sized to 1 1/4” long) typically turn attractive shades of orange, yellow and red in fall.Genus name comes from the Latinized form of the Arabian name for the fruit.Specific epithet honors Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828) who  reportedly identified this species in Japan in 1784.
","
Problems
No serious pest problems. Some susceptibility to bacterial leaf spot, anthracnose, root rots, wilt, aphids, barberry webworm and scale. Spiny stems often trap unsightly wind-blown trash. Deer resistant. This species is known to be highly invasive in portions of the eastern United States, spreading readily by bird-dispersed seeds and forming impenetrable thickets which leaf out before native understory species, shading out wildflowers and other native plants.
","
Garden Uses
Accent for small areas in the landscape. Foundations. Shrub border. Hedge or edger. Spiny barrier plant.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Berchemia scandens, commonly known as supple-jack, is a woody vine of the buckthorn family that features tough stems, greenish-white flowers and blue fruits. It is native from Virginia to Missouri south to Florida and Texas. It is typically found in (1) bottomland forests and swampy woods as a twining vine that climbs high into trees and (2) much drier upland limestone glades as a sprawling vine that trails along the ground (see Steyermark). Stems have smooth gray-green bark. Ovate to elliptic leaves (to 2.5"" long) have distinctive parallel pinnate veins. Small greenish-white flowers bloom in open terminal clusters in mid to late spring. Flowers give way to blue drupes (each 1/4"" across) which mature in autumn. Drupes are inedible (mildly toxic) for humans.  Supple-jack is the name for a strong pliant walking stick made from a plant such as this vine.Genus name honors M. Berchem, French botanist of the 17th century.Specific epithet means ""climbing upward"" in reference to the climbing habit of this vine.Supple-jack is the name for a strong pliant walking stick made from a plant such as this vine. Vine stems can also be used to make wicker products, hence the additional common name of rattan vine.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Best grown in consistently moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade.  Tolerates full shade.  Also tolerates brief periods of drought, but foliage will suffer if soils are allowed to dry out.  Plants are evergreen in the South but leaves usually suffer considerable winter damage in cold climates such as St. Louis.  Remove all damaged foliage in late winter to early spring.  Promptly remove spent flowering stems.  Plants spread slowly by rhizomes.  Propagate by seed or division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bergenia crassifolia, commonly called leather bergenia or pig squeak, is a large-leaved evergreen perennial that is native to rocky cliffs from northwest China to Siberia.  Rosettes of leathery, fine-toothed, obovate-rounded green leaves (to  8"" long by 7"" wide) form dense, slowly-spreading clumps of foliage to 12"" tall.  Lavender pink flowers bloom March to early May in panicles atop rigid leafless stalks rising to 18"" tall.  Flowers will bloom as early as December in warm winter climates, hence the additional common name of winter blooming bergenia. Although evergreen, the leaves of this plant often  become brown and battered in cold winter temperatures.  

Genus name honors Karl August von Bergen (1704-1759), German physician and botanist.  

The specific epithet comes from the Latin words crassus meaning thick and folia meaning leaf in reference to the leathery leaves.

The common name of pig squeak is in reference to the noise produced by rubbing a leaf between thumb and finger.Genus name honors German physician and botanist Karl August von Bergen (1704-1759).The specific epithet comes from the Latin words crassus meaning thick and folia meaning leaf in reference to the leathery leaves.The common name of pig squeak is in reference to the noise produced by rubbing a leaf between thumb and finger.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade.  Prefers slightly alkaline, sandy or gravely soils.  Good tolerance for heat and drought.  May produce more flowers with consistent moisture, but at the cost of stem-drooping. Division is not recommended due to the long taproot which gives this species its drought tolerance. May self-seed in the garden. Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Berlandiera lyrata, commonly called chocolate flower (also known as lyreleaf green eyes) is native to dry sandy loams, rocky limestone soils, mesas, plains, grasslands and roadsides in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Mexico.  It typically grows to 1-2' tall on branched, usually erect but sometimes decumbent stems, and features aromatic, night blooming, daisy-like flowers (1-2"" diameter) with yellow rays, maroon-brown center discs and green cup-like bracts.  Flowers appear on leafless stems.  Yellow rays have red veins (sometimes entirely red) on the reverse side.  Leaves are deep green above and whitish below, with irregular pinnate lobes.  Flowers bloom at night from late spring to frost, but in frost free areas will bloom year round. Flowers smell like chocolate, with the aroma being most noticeable in early to mid-morning before the petals close up or drop.Genus name honors Jean-Louis Berlandier (1805-1851), French-Swiss botanist and physician, who collected plants in Texas and Mexico in the early 1800s.Specific epithet means lyre-like in reference to the leaf shape.Common name of lyreleaf green eyes is in reference to (1) pinnate deeply-lobed leaf has lyre-like curves and (2) once the yellow flower petals drop, the remaining stiff cupped green calyces surrounding the center disk resemble a green eye.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, light to sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  For many of the plants in this species, seeds (dried ""seed clusters"", each with 3 or 4 seeds) are typically sown in the ground about 30 days prior to the last spring frost date in Zones 3-7 for harvest in summer and fall or in the alternative, are sown in summer in Zones 8-10 for harvest over winter.  Several seedlings will emerge from each seed cluster.  Seedlings should be thinned to a spread appropriate for the specific type of plant being grown.  Successive plantings may be made at monthly intervals during the growing season (seed planted in the heat of summer may not germinate however).  For proper growth, species plants generally need regular and consistent moisture, with additional water provided during hot and dry summer periods.  

For specific growing instructions on growing plants within each Cultivar Group of this species, consult the specific recommendations applicable to the Group of the plant being grown.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Beta vulgaris, commonly known as beet, is an herbaceous biennial (infrequently perennial) which is typically grown today as an annual.  The ancestor plant for this species is the wild sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritime) which was probably native to coastal parts of the Mediterranean, but which eventually spread over time to the Atlantic Coast of Europe, the Near East and India.  Sea beet can still be found as a wild plant along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts.  In general, beets of this species have been valued since ancient times for their edible leaves and midribs.  Ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated beets as potherbs.  Cultivation of beet roots as food first gained momentum in the 16th century.   From the 16th century onward, Europeans began to consume the roots primarily as a vegetable. During the 1800’s, intense artificial selection in Europe produced diverse beet cultivars used today for a variety of different purposes.  
 
Beet cultivars today are classified into four different Groups (a Group being an assemblage of named cultivars with similar characteristics).  Groups grown for their thickened tuberous roots (beets) are: 

1.	Beta vulgaris (Garden Beet or Beetroot Group) is the red root vegetable sold in grocery stores around the world as garden beets.  This Group is best associated with the word “beet”. 

2.	Beta vulgaris (Sugar Beet Group) is the plant which is commercially grown for sugar production (roots contain high concentrations of sucrose).  Roots were first found to contain sugar in 1747.  This beet was developed in Germany in the late 18th century.  About 20-25% of the sugar produced in the world today comes from sugar beets.

3.	Beta vulgaris (Fodderbeet Group or Mangelwurzel) is grown for its tubers which are harvested for use as livestock fodder.  It was developed in the 18th century. 

Group grown for their leaves rather than tuberous roots:  

4.	Beta vulgaris (Leaf Beet Group) is a leaf vegetable (e.g. chard or spinach beet) which is grown for harvest of its edible leaves and midribs.  Leaf beets have been cultivated from ancient times to present.  Group plants lack swollen tubers/roots.  Spinach beet is similar in taste to spinach (Spinacia).  
 
In general, genus plants typically grow to 2-3’ tall (to 4-6’ tall when in flower in the second year).  Ovate to wedge-shaped, long-petioled, basal leaves (to 6” long) appear in rosettes with smaller, alternate, second-year stem leaves.  Deep purple-red (but sometimes golden yellow or red/white striped) roots are usually swollen, except in the case of the leafy vegetable plants found in the Leaf Beet Group.  Flowers (usually greenish and non-showy, but sometimes with red or purple tinges) bloom in dense spikes only in the second year, which means the flowers are typically not seen when plants are grown and harvested for their beets and/or leaves as one-year annuals.Genus name comes from the Latin name for beet.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning common.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Beets may suffer from fungal leaf spots, downy mildew, powdery mildew and root rots. Watch for leaf miners, flea beetles, leafhoppers, aphids and caterpillars.
","
Garden Uses
Edible garden vegetable for harvest of underground beets and/or leaves and/or foliage ornamental (Leaf Beet and Garden Beet Groups).  Commercial source of sucrose for production of sugar (Sugar Beet Group). Fodder for livestock (Fodder Group cultivars).

Culture
Easily grown average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. River birch is perhaps the most culturally adaptable and heat tolerant of the birches. Prefers moist, acidic, fertile soils including semi-aquatic conditions, but also tolerates drier soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. Adapts well to heavy clay soils of Missouri and will tolerate poor drainage. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula nigra, commonly called river birch, is a vigorous, fast-growing, medium-sized, Missouri native deciduous tree which occurs on floodplains, swampy bottomlands and along streams throughout the State. In cultivation, it can be trained as either a single trunk or multi-trunked tree. As a single trunk tree, it develops a pyramidal habit when young, but matures to a more rounded shape typically growing 40-70' tall. Multi-trunked trees form a more irregular crown and are generally considered to be the superior growth habit for this species. Salmon-pink to reddish brown bark exfoliates to reveal lighter inner bark. Leathery, diamond-shaped, medium to dark green leaves (1.5-3.5"" long) with doubly toothed margins turn yellow in fall. Monoecious flowers appear in drooping, brownish male catkins and smaller, upright, greenish female catkins.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means black.
","
Problems
One of the most disease-free birches. Most species of birch grow best in cool, northern climates, but do not adapt well to the hot summers of USDA Zones 5-9 and can be short-lived therein. Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which typically infects and kills birches stressed by summer heat and humidity. River birches are Missouri natives that are naturally adapted to the climate and are extremely resistant to birch borer. Although river birches have some susceptibility to aphids, leaf miner and iron chlorosis in high pH soils, these problems are somewhat minor in comparison to the birch borer.'Heritage' is a very popular river birch cultivar with superior ornamental features to the species (see Betula nigra 'Curly' HERITAGE).
","
Garden Uses
Specimen or small groupings for lawns, parks and commercial properties, and, in particular, for wet soils along ponds, streams or in low spots. Good choice for the St. Louis area and generally a good substitute for the paper birch in the hot and humid areas of USDA Zones 5-9.

Culture
Best grown in acidic, moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in moist fertile soils.  Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist.  Little pruning is needed, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season.  Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running because bleeding will occur.  Tolerates flooding.   Best growth occurs in USDA Zones 4-6.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula occidentalis, commonly known as water birch, is a shrubby tree of riparian woodlands that is most commonly found growing in clumps or thickets along rivers, streams, springs or other water courses in elevations to 8000’ from the Cascades, forested areas of Western Canada, and the Canadian Rockies south through the U.S. Rockies to New Mexico.  It is often seen growing as a single to multi-stemmed shrub to 10-15’ tall, but sometimes rises to as much as 40-50’ tall as a multi-trunked tree with a broad, irregular, open crown.   

Non-peeling bark is shiny, reddish-brown and marked with white horizontal streaks.  Alternate, deciduous, broad-ovate leaves (each to 1-3” long) have rounded to wedge-shaped bases, blunt to sharp-pointed tips, 4-5 pairs of side veins and a double row of fine, sharp-pointed marginal teeth.  Leaves are dark greenish yellow and shiny above, but paler and gland-dotted beneath.  

Male and female flowers bloom in separate catkins on same plant in spring.  The drooping brownish male catkins are larger (to 2.5” long) than the smaller more upright female catkins   Fruiting cones (to 1.2” long) appear in late summer.  Each cone containing numerous 3-lobed scales, with each scale enclosing a tiny winged seed.    

This plant serves in the wild as a source for food and lodging materials for beavers.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means western in probable reference to its western U.S. native origin.
","
Problems
Birch leaf miner and aphids are potential insect problems.  Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which can infect and kill trees, particularly those that are stressed by summer heat and humidity.  Plants stressed by insects seem more susceptible to cankers.  Watch for leaf spot diseases.  Iron chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.  Susceptible to honey fungus.
","
Garden Uses
Water birch is most frequently grown within the geographic area of its native range.  It is particularly effective when planted in small groups in consistently moist to wet soils along ponds, streams or in low spots.

Culture
In St. Louis, paper birch is best grown in medium to wet, well-drained sandy or rocky loams in part shade. It is best sited in a northern or eastern exposure that receives some afternoon shade. It needs consistently moist soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. It needs little pruning, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running. Performs best in cool northern climates where summer temperatures rarely exceed 75 degrees F. and where root zones are generally covered with snow throughout the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula papyrifera, commonly called paper birch or canoe birch, is primarily native to the cold climates of Canada and Alaska (USDA Zones 1-3), with its range dipping down into a few of the northern U.S. states (USDA Zones 4-5A) and further south in the mountains (to Colorado in the Rockies and to North Carolina in the Appalachians). This tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips to reveal an orange-brown inner bark. Mature trees develop black markings on the white bark. Single trunk trees grow to 50-70’ tall with an oval rounded crown. Multi-trunked trees grow shorter with a more irregular crown. Ovate, irregularly toothed, dark green leaves (to 4” long). Quality clear yellow fall color. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in drooping catkins (to 4” long) and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1 1/4” long). Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer. The use of the bark for making birch bark canoes is well known.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means paper-bearing.
","
Problems
This species of birch grows poorly and is generally short-lived in the St. Louis climate. It thrives in cool northern summers, but does poorly in the heat and humidity of St. Louis summers. Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which, in the St. Louis area, typically infects and kills trees that are stressed by summer heat and humidity. Although paper birches have some susceptibility to aphids, leaf miner, birch skeletonizer and dieback, these problems are somewhat minor in comparison to the borer.
","
Garden Uses
In cool northern climates, paper birch is an excellent landscape tree that mixes well with evergreens and produces good fall color. It is not recommended for the St. Louis climate. River birch (see Betula nigra) is a better selection for St. Louis.

In St. Louis, European white birch is best grown in medium to wet, well-drained sandy or rocky loams in full sun to part shade. Although it prefers full sun in its native habitat, in St. Louis, it is best sited in a northern or eastern exposure that receives some afternoon shade. It needs consistently moist soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. Tolerates some dry soils, but is best in consistently moist ones. It needs little pruning, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running. Performs best in cool northern climates where summer temperatures rarely exceed 75 degrees F. and where root zones are generally covered with snow throughout the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula pendula, commonly called European white birch or white birch, is native to Europe and Asia Minor where it typically occurs in wood margins, heaths, hills and slopes. It has been widely planted in Canada and the northern U.S. as an ornamental. As is the case with paper birch (B. papyrifera), this tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips. It is also noted for its drooping or pendulous branches, hence the specific epithet. Mature trees become furrowed and blackish-gray near the bottom of the trunk. It is a small to medium sized tree that typically grows to 30-40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with a pyramidal to oval rounded crown. Ovate, glabrous, toothed, glossy green leaves (to 2.5” long) have long tapered tips. Greenish-yellow fall color is usually undistinguished. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in drooping catkins (to 2.5” long) and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1 1/4” long). Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means hanging.

Culture
In St. Louis, gray birch is best grown in medium to wet, well-drained, sandy or rocky loams in full sun to part shade. It seems to tolerate drier soils in its native range. It also tolerates poor soils. In the St. Louis area, it is best sited in a northern or eastern exposure that receives some afternoon shade. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. It needs little pruning, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running. Performs best in cool northern climates where summer temperatures rarely exceed 75 degrees F. and where shallow root systems are generally covered with snow throughout the winter. In optimum growing conditions, plants will easily spread by suckers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula populifolia, commonly called gray birch, is a short-lived, narrow-columnar, suckering, deciduous tree that typically grows to 20-40’ tall.  It most often appears in a multi-trunked form, but also grows with a single trunk.  It is native primarily from Southeastern Canada to Virginia, with a scattering of plants extending westward to Illinois.  It typically occurs in both dry and wet soils.  This tree is noted for (1) its non-peeling chalky white bark with dark chevron trunk patches appearing below each branch base and (2) its long-pointed triangular green leaves.  Triangular leaves (each to 3” long) are double-toothed and shiny with tapered tips.  Fall color is usually undistinguished.  Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree:  yellowish-brown male flowers in single catkins (to 4” long) at the branch tips and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1/2” long).  Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer.  Plants have rough-warty twigs.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet come from the Latin populus meaning poplar genus and folia meaning leaves like those of the poplar.Species name comes from Populus (poplar genus) and Latin folia (leaf) in reference to leaf appearance.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates full shade, but best flower production occurs in sun.  Prune after flowering if needed.  Above ground stems are not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they may die to the ground in severe winters (roots are usually hardy therein and will sprout new growth the following spring).  In St. Louis, it is best to plant this vine in a protected location and apply a winter mulch.  Established plants may send up root suckers which should be removed if spread is not desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bignonia capreolata, known as cross-vine, is a vigorous, woody vine that climbs by branched tendrils with adhesive disks.  It is grown primarily for its attractive flowers and its ability to rapidly cover structures with attractive foliage.  Opposite, compound leaves are bifoliate.  Each leaf consists of a pair of lanceolate to oblong dark green leaflets (to 6” long) and a branched tendril between them.  Tendril branches terminate in adhesive disks that easily attach to walls.  Foliage remains evergreen in the South, but turns reddish-purple in fall with subsequent leaf drop in the colder winter areas of its range.  Axillary clusters (2-5 flowered cymes) of fragrant, trumpet-shaped, orange-red flowers (to 2” long) appear in spring.  Flowers are followed by greenish, pod-like seed capsules (to 7” long) which mature in late summer and persist into fall.  

This vine is in the same family as and closely related to Campsis radicans which is commonly known as trumpet vine.Genus name honors of Abbe Jean Paul Bignon (1662-1743), Librarian to Louis XIV.Specific epithet means having tendrils.A cross section of stem reveals a marking resembling the Greek cross, hence the common name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
A vigorous, fast-growing cover for fences, arbors, walls, pillars, large trellises and other structures.  Also may be grown along the ground.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bixa orellana, commonly called annato or achiote, is an evergreen tropical shrub or small tree that is native to tropical parts of Central and South America.  It has been introduced over time to a large number of tropical areas around the world including South East Asia, India and the Philippines.  As a shrub, it typically grows to 6-12' tall, but as a tree will sometimes rise to 20-30' tall.  Pointed, ovate to heart-shaped leaves grow to 3-7"" long.  Ornamentally attractive pink flowers (2"" diameter) bloom in terminal branched panicles.  Each flower has 5 deciduous sepals and five petals.  Flowers are followed by bristly spiny fruit in reddish-brown to bright red capsules.  Fruits ripen throughout the year in tropical climates.  Each fruit capsule resembles in appearance the bur of a chestnut tree (Castanea).  The capsule splits open when ripe to reveal seeds in a layer of orange pulp.  Annato is the name of a tasteless orange/yellow dye extracted from the pulp surrounding the seeds.  This dye was used many years ago by indigenous people for a variety of purposes including body paint, insect repellant, food colorant, inks, dyes, sunscreen, soap additives and fabric colorant.  This plant was also reported to have medicinal uses ranging from treatment for fevers to dysentary to cancers.   In the modern world, dyes from this plant are still commercially produced for adding yellow color to a number of food products including chorizo, margarine, rice and cheese.  Indigenous people still use the dyes for cosmetics (hence the common name of lipstick tree) and hair dyes.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the South American vernacular name for this evergreen tree.Specific epithet honors Francisco de Orellano (1511-1546), Spanish explorer and conquistador, who discovered the Amazon River.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Best grown in humusy, acidic, evenly moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. May be divided in spring. Spreads somewhat slowly by short creeping rhizomes. Deer fern has good winter hardiness in USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Blechnum spicant, called deer fern or hard fern, is a northern species with a somewhat circumpolar distribution but most ferns in the genus Blechnum are found in tropical areas. It is native to northwestern North American from Alaska to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, a small corner of northern Idaho and California. It primarily occurs in moist to wet coniferous forests, wet slide areas, stream banks or bogs in up to sub-alpine terrain. It is also native to Europe and northeast Asia. This fern is particularly distinctive because of its two different types of fronds. Evergreen sterile fronds (to 8-24” long) are stiff, leathery, pinnatifid and dark green, forming a loose outward-spreading, flattened rosette. As the season progresses, sterile fronds may lie horizontally on the ground. Fertile fronds (16-24” long) are located in an erect vertical fountain in the center of the sterile frond rosette. They are similar to the sterile ones but taller, with much thinner and widely separated leaflets. Fertile fronds turn brown and wither by the end of the summer, leaving the evergreen sterile rosette.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name blechnon for a fern (probably not this one though).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spot and rust may occur in some areas. Watch for caterpillars, mealybugs and scale.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Blephilia ciliata, commonly called Ohio horsemint, is a Missouri native perennial which occurs in dryish open woods and thickets, clearings, fields and roadsides in the eastern 2/3 of the State. A clump-forming, mint family member that features mostly unbranched, square stems which rise to 30"" tall. Blue-purple, two-lipped flowers appear in late spring to mid-summer in several tiered, whorled, globular clusters in an interrupted terminal spike, with each cluster being subtended by (resting upon) a whorl of fringed bracts. Similar in appearance to the closely related monardas. Lanceolate stem leaves are sessile, lightly-toothed, whitish-downy below and mildly fragrant when crushed. Leaves are usually considered to be lacking in the pungency and quality needed for use as a culinary herb. Small basal leaves and shoots remain green throughout the winter.Genus name comes from the Greek blepharis meaning an eyelash for the bracts being fringed by hairs.
","
Problems
Susceptible to powdery mildew. Foliage is often nibbled on by insects and plants can become rather tattered and unkempt by late summer.

Blephilia hirsuta, commonly called wood mint, is a Missouri native perennial which occurs in rich, moist, shady woods, slopes and valleys throughout the State in a scattering of counties. A clump-forming, mint family member that features square stems rising to 30"" tall. Blue-purple, two-lipped flowers appear in late spring to mid-summer in several tiered, whorled, globular clusters in an interrupted terminal spike, with each cluster being subtended by (resting upon) a whorl of fringed bracts. Similar in appearance to the closely related monardas. Stems and leaves are hairy (hirsuta in Latin means hairy). Ovate stem leaves are long-stalked, toothed and mildly fragrant when crushed. Leaves are usually considered to be lacking in the pungency and quality needed for use as a culinary herb. Small basal leaves and shoots remain green throughout the winter. This plant is very similar to Blephilia ciliata, except it is hairy, its stems are more frequently branched and its leaves have long stalks and noticeable teeth.Genus name comes from the Greek blepharis meaning an eyelash for the bracts being fringed by hairs.Specific epithet in Latin means hairy.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade. Some afternoon shade is essential in hot St. Louis summers. Plant corm-like pseudobulbs to 4” deep in spring. After flowering, continue to provide regular moisture to plants for the remainder of the growing season. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where a winter mulch is advisable. Will naturalize over time in optimum growing conditions by short rhizomes.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bletilla striata, commonly called Chinese ground orchid, is a terrestrial orchid which produces small, cattleya-like, pinkish-purple flowers (to 1.5” long) in 3-7 flowered racemes atop naked scapes typically rising to 18” tall. Blooms mid to late spring. Each pseudobulb typically produces 3-5, linear, pleated, papery-textured, sword-shaped, pale green leaves (to 12” long). Foliage dies to the ground in winter. Synonymous with Bletilla hyacinthina.Genus name honors Luis Blet, a Spanish apothecary who had a botanic garden in Algeciras towards the end of the 18th century.Specific epithet means striped.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs and snails are occasional visitors.
","
Garden Uses
Best in part-shade areas of borders or rock gardens. Good container plant, especially for areas north of USDA Zone 5 where it can easily be brought inside in winter.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Blighia sapida, commonly known as ackee or akee, is an evergreen tree of the soapberry family that typically grows to 25-50’ tall.  It is native to tropical West Africa.  It was reportedly introduced to Jamaica and some other parts of the British West Indies in the mid-1700s via slave ships coming from West Africa.  Mature trees have smooth gray bark.  Each pinnate compound leaf has 6-10 oblong to obovate leaflets (to 5” each).  Small five-petaled flowers in sessile cymes typically bloom biannually but occasionally more often.  Flowers are greenish white and fragrant.  Pear-shaped fruits are straw colored to magenta red.  Each fruit is a three-chambered capsule.  When ripe, each chamber splits to reveal three shiny seeds, each seed having a white fleshy aril at the base.  These fleshy arils are the edible parts of the fruit, but are only edible at certain times of the year, namely, when the fruit is fresh, ripe and just opened.  Arils are poisonous when unripe or when overly ripe (as when open and dropped to the ground).  Fruiting may occur throughout the year, but mostly occurs from December through May.  This tree is widely cultivated and naturalized in the tropics and subtropics.

Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica.  Ackee and saltfish is Jamaica’s national dish.  Jamaicans are among the only people in the world today who actually eat this fruit on a regular basis.

Captain William Bligh (1754-1817) brought several of these trees back from Jamaica to Kew Gardens in England aboard the HMS Providence in 1793.  Upon arrival at Kew, this tree was named Blighia sapida by K. D. Koenig in Bligh’s honor.  Captain Bligh is perhaps best known today not for his botanical or financial interests in plants, but for his ordeal in being set adrift in 1787 in the Mutiny on the Bounty incident.Genus name honors Captain William Bligh (1754-1817), captain of the Bounty.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word sapidus meaning of agreeable taste in reference to the fruit.Common name of ackee is derived from the West African akye fufo.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Boehmeria nivea, commonly known as China grass, white ramie, green ramie or rhea, is an upright deciduous, monoecious sub-shrub or shrub in the nettle family (no stinging hairs however) that typically grows to 8-10’ tall.  It is best known for providing a textile fiber of excellent strength and quality from the inner bark of the stems.  It was used to make mummy cloths in Egypt during the period of 5000-3000 BCE.  It is native to thickets, forest margins and roadsides, often in rocky places, in southern China to the Himalayas of Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal, but is now cultivated in a number of tropical to subtropical climates around the world,  including parts of the southeastern 
U.S. and California.  Despite its strength, however, it has had limited acceptance for textile use in the U.S.  

Unbranched stems from underground rhizomes often become woody and persistent at the base.  Long petioled, alternate, taper-pointed, broadly ovate leaves (to 4-7” long) have coarsely toothed margins.  Leaf undersides are white tomentose beneath.  Small apetalous monoecious greenish flowers in axillary clusters bloom July to August.

Ramie is chiefly used for fabric production.  Outer bark is removed and then the fibrous inner bark is taken off and boiled before being spun into thread.  Tensile strength is 7 time that of silk and 8 times that of cotton.  It is often blended with cotton (55% ramie and 45% cotton).  

This species is extremely variable but can always be told by (a) flowers appear in cymes, (b) leaves are alternate, and (c) achenes appear on a stipe or stalk.Genus name honors George Rudolf Boehmer (1723-1803), professor of botany and anatomy at Wittenberg, Germany.Specific epithet means snow-white in probable reference to the underside of the leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Primarily used world-wide as a fiber crop to produce ramie, a strong, silky, flax-like fiber that is used in fabric.  Uses include sewing threads, cloth, parachute fabrics, woven fire hoses, canvas, rope and wearing apparel.  Plants are typically not planted in home gardens for ornamental purposes.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a wide range of soils including moderately dry ones.  Plants grown in part shade or in rich, moist soils tend to flop and need support.  Plants grown in drier soils will grow shorter, but often less vigorously with inferior flowering.  If support becomes an issue, plant stems may be pinched or cut back by 1/3, in somewhat the same way as with many asters, in late spring to early summer to reduce plant height and minimize support needs.  Slowly spreads by creeping rhizomes.  Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Boltonia asteroides, commonly called false chamomile or false aster, is a rhizomatous perennial which typically grows to 5-6’ tall on erect, usually branching stems clad with alternate, linear, lance-shaped, stalkless, gray-green leaves (to 5” long).  Tiny, daisy-like flowers (to 3/4” diameter) in loose panicles typically cover this aster-like plant with a profuse bloom from late summer to early fall.  Flowers typically have white rays with yellow center disks, but sometimes the rays are pink-tinged, violet or purple.  Fruits are seed-like achenes.  This boltonia is native to wet prairies, wet meadows, marshes, stream banks and pond peripheries in eastern and central North America from North Dakota to Maine south to Florida and Texas plus Manitoba and Saskatchewan with disjunct populations in Oregon and Idaho.Genus name honors James Bolton (1735-1799), English botanist.Specific epithet means resembling asters in obvious reference to flower similarity.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Taller plants may need support.  Susceptible to powdery mildew.
","
Garden Uses
Naturalized areas, cottage gardens or native plant gardens.  May be used in border backgrounds, however species plants are somewhat weedy and several varieties and cultivars might be better border selections -- see e.g., Boltonia asteroides var. latisquama ‘Snowbank' which is a compact plant (3-4’ tall) with white daisy-like flowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Boltonia decurrens, commonly called decurrent false aster is a threatened species that is only known to occur along the Illinois River in west central Illinois and along the Mississippi River in both Illinois and Missouri just north of St. Louis. It typically is found in muddy bottomlands where disturbance and cyclical flooding occur. It is very similar to the much more common Boltonia asteroides, except for its decurrent foliage and lack of rhizomes. This plant typically grows in a clump to 4-6’ tall on erect, usually branching stems. Lance-shaped, grayish-green leaves (to 5” long) are distinctively decurrent. Pale pink to white daisy-like flowers (to 1” diameter) in loose panicles literally cover this aster-like plant with a profuse bloom in August and September. Each flower has pale pink to white rays with a yellow center disk. This species is also commonly called winged false aster and claspingleaf doll’s daisy. It is synonymous with and formerly designated as Boltonia asteroides var. decurrens and Boltonia latisquama var. decurrens.Genus name honors James Bolton (1735-1799), English botanist.Specific epithet means extend down along the stem from the leaf bases.So named because the leaves are decurrent (clasp and extend down along the stem from the leaf bases) and the flowers look like small asters.

Culture
Grow in dry to medium moisture well-drained soils in full sun.  In southern Florida, it is best grown with moderate but even applications of moisture to the soil.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bombax ceiba, commonly known as red silk-cotton tree, is a large, spiny, deciduous tree (briefly deciduous during the flowering period) that typically matures to 60-75’ tall and to 40-60’ wide, but may soar to as much as 150’ tall in optimum growing environments.  It is native to monsoon forested areas including river valleys, savannas and hillsides below 4,000’ in elevation in China and Indomalaysia in areas where soil moisture levels often change significantly during the course of a year, ranging from long periods of dry, hot and humid conditions to much shorter periods of moist to wet conditions as a result of heavy rainfall associated with monsoon activity.  Trees have been widely planted over time in tropical to sub-tropical regions around the world.  This tree was introduced into the U.S. in southern Florida in 1912. 

Trees feature:  (a) straight trunks (2-5’ diameter) with horizontal to upright branches in tiered whorls; (b) cone-shaped spines typically cover the trunk and branches when trees are young, but the spines become less prominent as the trees mature; (c) large trees are often conspicuously buttressed at the base; (d) palmate green leaves (to 24” long), each leaf having 5-7 smooth, leathery, acuminate, lanceolate to elliptic leaflets; (e) showy 5-petaled  red to orange-red flowers (each to 6-7” long) bloom singly or in clusters for about one month in late winter to early spring;  (f)  fruits (pointed, longitudinally ribbed, woody seed capsules to 6” long filled with silky hairs) follow the flowers.  

This tree starts dropping its leaves each year in January-February in anticipation of flowering (March-April).  Flowers begin appearing when the tree is leafless.  Ground becomes littered with fallen petals during the month of bloom.  New leaves appear only after almost all of the flowering is completed (typically by April).  Flowers are followed by seed pods which split open in April-May to release to the wind large quantities of silky cotton imbedded with small brown seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek word bombyx meaning silk in reference to the silky hairs in the seed capsule.Specific epithet comes from a Spanish derivative name in reference to a group of large, tropical trees related to Bombax.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Borago officinalis is native to the Mediterranean region. It is a rough, sprawling annual that grows to 1-3’ tall. It features showy, open racemes of drooping, star-shaped, bright blue flowers in summer atop branched stems clad with wrinkled, edible, dull gray-green leaves (to 6” long) having the taste and fragrance of cucumber. Stems and leaves are covered with bristly hairs. Tender leaves may be eaten raw or cooked in somewhat the same manner as spinach. Leaves lose their flavor when dried.Genus name possibly comes from the Latin word burra meaning hairy garment a reference to the hairy leaves of some species.Specific epithet means sold is shops and was applied to plants with supposed medicinal properties.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew may occur.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where this palm is easily grown in consistently moist well-drained soils in full sun.  Appreciates some light shade in hot sun locations.  Drought tolerant once established.  Larger plants are difficult to transplant because of deep roots.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Borassus flabellifer, commonly called palmyra palm, toddy palm or lontar palm, is a large fan palm that typically matures to 60’ tall and to 25’ wide featuring a straight solitary gray trunk (to 3’ in diameter) ringed with leaf  scars and a globose crown of rigid palmate leaves (each to 8-10’ long) with spiny stalks. This palm is native to India, Sri Lanka and Malaya.  Near white flowers appear in pendant clusters from the leaf axils in late spring to early summer.  Male and female flowers are borne on different trees (dioecious).  Male flowers are small (less than 1/2”).  Female flowers are larger (to 1”) and give way to subglobose fleshy brown fruits (to 6-8” wide).  It is impossible to determine the sex of a tree until flowering occurs.Genus name comes from the Greek word borassos meaning the immature spadix of date palm.Specific epithet from the Latin word flabellatus meaning like an open fan.Tree sap, called toddy, is tapped for use as a beverage, hence the common name of toddy palm. 

Leaves were formerly used as paper (lontar) in Indonesia, hence the common name of lontar palm.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture soils in full sun. Tolerates wide range of soil conditions from well-drained sandy soils to heavy clays. May be grown from seed and may self-seed in the garden in optimum growing conditions. Cut clumps to the ground in late winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bouteloua curtipendula, commonly called sideoats grama, is a Missouri native grass which is noted for the distinctive arrangement of oat-like seed spikes which hang from only one side of its flowering stems. Typically occurs in glades, prairies, open rocky woodlands and along railroad tracks throughout most of the State. Narrow, bluish-gray leaf blades (to 1/4"" wide) typically form a dense clump growing 1-1.5' tall. Foliage turns golden brown in autumn, sometimes also developing interesting hues of orange and red. Inflorescences of purplish-tinged flowers appear on arching stems above the foliage in early to mid summer, typically bringing the total height of the clump to 3' tall. Inflorescences fade to tan as the seeds mature.Genus name honors two Spanish brothers Claudius (d. 1842) and Exteban Boutelou (d. 1813) professors of botany and agriculture respectively.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Mass in meadows, prairies, slopes, native plant gardens or naturalized areas. Notwithstanding the excellent ornamental features of this grass, it may also be grown as a turf grass and regularly mowed to 2-4 inches tall.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bouteloua gracilis, commonly called blue grama or mosquito grass, is a tufted, warm season, Missouri native grass noted for its distinctive arrangement of mosquito larvae-like seed spikes which hang from only one side of its flowering stems.  It is native to prairies, plains, open rocky woodlands and along railroad tracks throughout the Western U.S. It was a dominant grass of the dry shortgrass prairies.  Narrow, bluish-gray leaf blades (to 1/4” wide) typically form a dense clump growing 12-15"" tall.  Foliage turns golden brown in autumn, sometimes also developing interesting hues of orange and red.  Inflorescences of purplish-tinged flowers appear on arching stems above the foliage in early to mid summer, typically bringing the total height of the clump to 20"" tall.Genus name honors two Spanish brothers Claudius (d. 1842) and Exteban Boutelou (d. 1813) professors of botany and agriculture respectively.Specific epithet from Latin means slender or graceful.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Small size makes blue grama grass an excellent selection for rock gardens where it can be used as a specimen or in small groups. Also an excellent choice for naturalized areas, native plant gardens, unmowed meadows, prairie areas or other informal areas in the landscape, especially where drought tolerant plants are needed. Can also be grown as a turf grass and regularly mowed to 2 inches high. Flower spikes are an excellent addition for dried flower arrangements.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Boykinia aconitifolia, commonly known as Allegheny brookfoam, is a rhizomatous, herbaceous perennial native to moist, rocky stream banks, lake and pond margins, and other moist woodland areas in the central and southern Appalachians. Mature plants can reach up to 2.5' tall when in bloom and spread via underground rhizomes to fill a 2' area. The basal leaves have toothed lobes and can reach up to 3"" long and 5"" wide. The flowering stems are dark red to brown in color and topped with branching clusters of small, white flowers that bloom from late spring into summer.The genus name Boykinia honors Dr. Samuel Boykin (1786-1848), American physician, botanist, and senator who studied and worked in Georgia.The specific epithet aconitifolia means ""leaves like Aconitum"", in reference to the similarities between the shape of the leaves of this species and the shape of the leaves of some species in the genus Aconitum.The common name Allegheny brookfoam refers to both the native range of this species and its preferred stream-side habitats.
","
Problems
No pest or disease problems have been reported.
","
Garden Uses
An airy addition to pond margins as well as consistently moist areas of woodland gardens and rock gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Likes shady areas.  Avoid wet soils.  Invasive in the Pacific Northwest where it colonizes forest understories by outcompeting native plants.  Spreads by self seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brachypodium sylvaticum, commonly called slender false brome, is a tufted perennial bunchgrass that typically grows to 3’ tall.  It is native to woodland and open grassland areas of Europe, western Asia and northern Africa.  This is an invasive species of grass that was first discovered growing in the U. S. in 1939 west of the Cascades in an area of the Willamette Valley near Eugene, Oregon (possibly escaped from USDA experimental gardens in the area).  It has now naturalized throughout much of the Willamette Valley with heavy concentrations in the forests and foothills near Eugene and Corvallis.  Additional plants have been discovered in northern California and southern Washington State.  Slender false brome is rarely found in eastern North America (several populations sited in New York, Ontario and Virginia) where the invasive potential of this Mediterranean grass is, at this time, not clearly understood.    

Slender false brome grass features  (1) branchless hollow culms (flower stalks) rising to 3’ tall, (2) dense tufts of arching, hairy, linear-lanceolate, yellow-green to green leaves to 12” long by 1/2” wide,  (3) culm-topping, noticeably drooping flower spikes, each of which contains 4-12 spikelets (flower clusters) on very short 1/2” pedicels, and (4) a lengthy July-October bloom.Genus name comes from the Greek words brachys meaning short and podion meaning a foot in reference to the short pedicels of the flower spikelets.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word sylvaticus meaning in woods and forests in reference to native habitat.Common name suggests the possibility of misidentifying slender false brome as a brome (genus Bromus) which it is not.

Culture
Easily grown as an annual in fertile, organically rich, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun.   Tolerates light shade.  For culinary purposes, certain plants in this genus may be grown in home gardens by seed as annuals for harvest of mustard greens.  Sow seeds directly in the ground in early spring 3/4” to 1” apart with 2’ between rows.  Thin to 4-6” apart.  Floating row covers are useful.  Best to water plants early in the day so that they will dry off before nightfall, thus reducing the likelihood of attracting fungal diseases.   Crop should be ready to harvest 40-50 days after planting.  Smaller and younger leaves are usually milder than larger and more mature leaves.  Leaves are stronger-flavored as plants begin to bolt.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brassica juncea, commonly known as Chinese mustard, brown mustard, Indian mustard, or leaf mustard, is an annual herb that is native to southern and eastern Asia.  It has been cultivated for food in Europe and Asia for hundreds of years.  It has given rise to a diverse range of leaf vegetables, little known in Europe, but popular in eastern Asia, including various Chinese mustard greens and Japanese mizuna.  

This plant has been much cultivated in some areas for harvest of spring mustard greens which may be added raw to salads.  Older leaves are often boiled before eating.  Garden plants typically grow to 1-2’ tall, featuring short, petiolate, elliptic to obovate basal leaves (to 1’ long) with 2-3 lobes per side and upper stem leaves which are much smaller and entire.  Leaf edges are toothed, scalloped or frilled.  Masses of bright, yellow, 4-petaled flowers mature to 1.5” long, but are not ornamentally attractive.  

Although extensively grown as a vegetable for its leaves, this plant is also often grown in some areas for its pungent seeds which are used to flavor many dishes and for its seed oil which is used in Asia for cooking.  Pods containing smooth brown seeds mature in summer.  Seed is the source of brown mustard.   

This plant has also developed a reputation outside the culinary area as a somewhat invasive weed (it is currently included on invasive species lists in Michigan, Florida and Alaska).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means rush-like.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Flea beetles, caterpillars, aphids, snails and slugs are the most frequent pests.
","
Garden Uses
Typically grown in the U.S. from seed in home vegetable gardens, but not as an ornamental plant.  Young plants can be used raw in salads, or steamed or stir-fried when more mature.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, consistently moist, well-composted, well-drained loams in full sun.   Tolerates light shade.  Soil pH should be between 6 and 6.5.  In St. Louis, rutabagas can be attempted as a spring crop (plant seeds in March), but are typically grown for fall harvest in large part because the tuberous roots need cool temperatures for harvest of the best crop and the roots are slow to mature (rutabagas take 4 weeks longer than turnips to reach harvest size).  For fall harvest, sow seed in June (100 days before first fall frost) in rows 18-24"" apart.  Thin seedlings in each row to about 6"" apart.  Leaves from the plants thinned out can be eaten as greens.  Rutabagas may be harvested in fall after light frost (mulch to protect roots from low temperatures of late fall).  Begin harvest when roots are about 3-5"" in diameter.  Frost typically sweetens maturing rutabagas.  Rutabagas may be left in the ground until needed, but if left too long they become somewhat woody with significant loss of quality taste.  Dig up rutabagas, remove tops and side roots, and store in a root cellar prior to the onset of significant hard freezes.  In the southern U. S. (south of USDA Zone 6),  rutabagas  may be planted in fall and grown over winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brassica napus (Napobrassica Group) is commonly called rutabaga.  Additional common names include Swede and Swedish turnip.  It is believed to be native to Scandanavia and Russia, probably being a cross between a cabbage and a turnip.  It grows well in the temperate climates of eastern and midwestern U. S., particularly in areas north of USDA Zone 7.   Tuberous edible roots are larger, firmer and rounder than those of turnips with longer necks and finer textured flesh.  Flesh is yellowish.  Shape is oval.   Foliage is bluish green, smooth and edible (particularly when young).  Rutabaga plants typically grow 12-24"" tall and 12"" wide.  Within this same species, Brassica napus (Oleifera Group) is grown for vegetable oils (including canola) and Brassica napus (Pabularia Group) for its kale-like salad greens.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.
","
Problems
Clubroot is a significant problem which not only destroys a crop but will also prevents planting future crops in the same location (spores remain in the soil for 20 years).  Plantings are also susceptible to powdery mildew, anthracnose, alternaria, root knot and leaf spot.  Aphids, cutworms, loopers, flea beetles, root maggots, and wireworms are potential insect problems.
","
Garden Uses
Vegetable. Smaller leaves make excellent additions to salads.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained loams in full sun.  Kale is a cool weather vegetable that is best grown in the cool temperatures of fall.  Leaves typically acquire their best flavor after the first fall frost.  It may also be grown in early spring.  If grown in summer, however, plants will need some afternoon shade, perhaps to simply survive.  Plants perform poorly when daytime temperatures begin to consistently exceed 80 degrees F.  For spring plantings, sow seed indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  In the alternative, transplants may be purchased from local nurseries.  In either case, the seedlings/transplants should be planted in the garden about 1-2 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  For fall plantings, sow seed indoors in early July and plant the seedlings in the garden in mid-August.  Plants tolerate light frosts.  Depending on temperatures, plants may survive to Thanksgiving or into December in some years.  In mild winter climates, plants often survive winter and continue to produce leaves until they bolt in spring.  Apply mulch around plants to protect the shallow roots, reduce weeds and retain soil moisture.  Rotate crops to avoid soil borne diseases.  Plants may also be grown in containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brassica oleracea (Acephala Group), commonly called kale, is a cool weather vegetable that is grown for harvest of its edible leaves.  Although very similar to cabbage, kale is distinguished by having loose, upright, wavy-edged leaves that do not form a head (acephala from Greek means headless).  Cabbage forms heads.  Leaves are typically light green to blue green, but ornamental kales (grown primarily for ornamental foliage) come in leaf colors ranging from purple to red to pink to white.  Acephala Group also includes genetically similar spring greens and collard greens.  Kale is a biennial that is grown in St. Louis as an annual.  Plants will grow to 18"" tall.  Leaves may be harvested when they reach the approximate size of a human hand.  Kale belongs to the Brassica family which includes other cool season vegetables such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower and kohlrabi.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means of the vegetable garden.
","
Problems
Watch for cabbageworms, cabbage loopers, flea beetles, caterpillars, thrips, slugs and aphids.  Root maggots may be a problem in some areas.  Potential disease problems include leaf spots, blackleg, black rot and yellows.

Culture
Asian greens are cold-tolerant and the seeds may be sown in flats or directly in the ground in early spring or in late summer to fall for a late season crop. Row covers may be necessary during severe cold, especially for mibuna which is less cold hardy. Seeds may also be sown during the summer although the quality may be less and bolting may be a problem in very hot weather. Asian greens grow best in fertile, moisture-retentive soil and lack of moisture at any stage adversely affects quality. Floating row covers provide sun and pest protection. Depending on the cultivar, space 4"" to 18"" apart with 18"" between rows. Plants may be harvested at almost any stage from seedling to mature plant. Harvest individual leaves or cut the plant about 3/4 inch above ground level to encourage resprouting.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asian greens group is a general term used to describe mizuna, mibuna, and in some cases, komatsuna greens. Other common names include Japanese mustard, potherb mustard, Japanese greens, and California peppergrass. They are all characterized by clumps of dark green leaves with thin white stalks. Mizuna leaves are dissected and feathery, mibuna leaves are long and narrow, and komatsuna leaves are oval-shaped. Primarily grown in Japan, these vegetables are becoming more popular in the United States, especially mizuna which is used in mesclun mixes. The flavor of Asian greens resembles that of cabbage, mustard, and spinach; as the plants age, the flavor may become more piquant.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means relating to turnips.
","
Problems
Asian greens suffer from all the normal brassica pests and diseases. Flea beetles, aphids, slugs, cabbage caterpillars and cutworms are the most likely pests. Possible diseases are bacterial rot and turnip mosaic virus.
","
Garden Uses
Asian greens are used raw or cooked in salads, soups, stir fries, or stuffing. Milder greens will be more flavorful when used raw.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, plants are best grown in containers and overwintered in humid, cool but frost-free locations such as large sunrooms, porches or greenhouses. They also may be grown as bedding plants or as a ground cover. Cuttings taken in late summer can be overwintered. These plants can be very difficult to overwinter in dry indoor conditions where they tend to drop all of their leaves. Grow in moderately rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage color usually develops in full sun. Tolerates wide range of soils, but prefers organically rich ones with consistent moisture. Periodic light pruning during the growing season stimulates new foliage growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Breynia disticha, commonly called snow bush, is a tropical shrub that typically grows 2-4’ tall. It is grown for its attractive red zigzag stems and variegated foliage. Elliptic to ovate green leaves (to 1” long) are liberally mottled with white. Cultivars of this species feature leaves mottled with pink, red and purple. Small greenish apetalous flowers are insignificant. Synonymous with B. disticha.Genus name honors Jacob Breyne (1637-1697), merchant in Danzig and his son Johann Philipp Breyne (1680-1764), physician in Danzig.

Culture
Easily grown in dry to medium moisture well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers full sun and dryish soil conditions.  Tolerates drought and somewhat poor soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brickellia eupatorioides, commonly known as false boneset, is an herbaceous perennial in the aster family that is native to dry open woods, thickets, clearings, rocky slopes, limestone glades and prairies from New Jersey to Missouri south to Texas and Florida.  It typically grows to 1-4’ tall on stems clad with narrow to lance-shaped, finely pubescent, gray to yellowish-green leaves (1 to 4” long), with each leaf featuring a single prominent center vein, margins that have occasional coarse teeth or are untoothed, and resinous glands underneath.  

Upper stems terminate in loose terminal clusters (small corymbs) of stalked and rayless (no petals) flowerheads.  Each flowerhead consists of 7-21 small, narrowly tubular, creamy white to pale yellow disk florets, with a thread-like style protruding from the center of the flowerhead.  An involucre of imbricated, narrow, overlapping bracts surrounds the base of each flowerhead.  Flowers bloom summer to early fall (July to October).  Flowers are followed by gray to light brown achenes which have tufts of white hair that are often more ornamentally attractive than the flowers.  Seeds are distributed to other locations by wind.

Kuhnia eupatorioides is a synonym.Genus name honors Irish physician Dr. John Brickell (c. 1749-1809) who settled in Georgia, USA.Specific epithet means like the genus Eupatorium.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Cut back clumps immediately after seed heads disintegrate to encourage additional foliage growth. Clumps may be mowed on high setting in late fall or dead foliage can be cleared in late winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Briza media, commonly called common quaking grass, is a rhizomatous, creeping, warm season ornamental grass which features a clump of narrow, erect, green leaves (1/4 to 1/2"" wide) typically growing 12 to 15"" tall. Tiny, greenish flowers appear in spring in loose, airy panicles atop stems rising well above the foliage clump to 24-36"" tall. Flowers give way to flattened hop-like, purplish-maturing-to-tan seed heads which dangle on thread-like stems and quiver in the slightest breeze, thus giving rise to the common name.Genus name comes from the Greek name for one of the food grains, possibly rye.Specific epithet means medicinal.Seed heads which dangle on thread-like stems and quiver in the slightest breeze has giving rise to the common name.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Best with medium moisture, but has good drought tolerance. Cut foliage back to the ground in late winter just before new shoots appear.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bromus inermis is a clump-forming, cool season, ornamental grass that typically grows to 2’ tall and spreads by creeping rhizomes. Leaf blades are typically 6-12” long. Flower stalks appear yellow, giving the plant an overall appearance of being yellow when in bloom. Flowers appear in July. Inflorescenses are open panicles (4-8” long) with whorled branching and oat-like pale green spikelets tinged with bronze and purple. Inflorescences turn golden brown in fall and are excellent additions to dried flower arrangements. The species is a coarse, rhizomatous, weedy grass that has very little ornamental interest for gardeners. Although native to Europe and Asia, the species has been cultivated in many areas of the United States as a forage and pasture grass and has been planted on banks for erosion control, particularly in the western states. It has naturalized along roadsides, in waste areas and in fields throughout much of the United States, and is commonly found in Missouri except in the Ozark region (Steyermark).Genus name comes from the Greek word bromos meaning oats.Specific epithet means unarmed or without prickles.‘Skinner’s Gold’ is a variegated-leaved cultivar.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can spread somewhat aggressively in some climates such as the Pacific Northwest, but is generally restrained in the St. Louis area.
","
Garden Uses
Accent, group or mass. Compact ornamental grass for borders. Ground cover. Also effective massed on banks or slopes for erosion control.

Culture
Easily grown in fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Tolerates a wide variety of soils.  Also tolerates heat, humidity, drought and urban pollution.  Prune in late fall or early winter when fully dormant to avoid bleeding.  This is a weedy, fast-growing tree or large shrub that spreads, often aggressively, by root suckers and/or self-seeding.  Wildlife feeds on the fruits and spreads the seed.  Invasive tendencies (particularly for fruit-bearing female trees) have resulted in placement of this tree on restricted tree lists for the States of Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.  Trees are best sited in locations protected from strong winds (shallow root systems make trees vulnerable to toppling over).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Broussonetia papyrifera, commonly known as paper mulberry, is a fast growing deciduous tree or large shrub.  It mature to 40-50’ tall with a broad rounded crown in the wild, but usually grows much shorter in cultivation.  Native to Japan, China and Polynesia.  It was originally introduced into the U.S. as a rapid-growing shade tree.  Over time, it has escaped cultivation and naturalized in a number of areas in the eastern U.S. from New York to Missouri south to Florida and Texas.  In optimum conditions, paper mulberry will easily spread to form thickets or colonies in waste areas, fields, forest margins and roadsides.  Paper mulberry is dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Young twigs are downy reddish-brown.  Gray bark matures over time to gray brown with furrows.  Trees have a milky sap.  Large, broad-oval, dull green leaves (to 8” long) with serrate margins and asymmetrically cordate bases are rough-textured above and dense-tomentose beneath.  Variable leaf shapes range from lobed to mitten shaped, sometimes with deep irregular sinuses.  Leaves are alternate, sometimes opposite, or sometimes whorled along the stem.  Yellow-green fall color can be interesting.  Pale green flowers bloom in April and May (male in pendulous catkins to 3” long and female in rounded flower heads).  If pollinated, flowers on female trees give way to reddish purple to orange aggregate fruits in balls.Genus name honors Pierre Auguste Marie Broussonet (1761-1807), French physician, naturalist and one-time professor of botany at Le Jardin des Plantes de Montpellier.Specific epithet comes from the Egyptian word papyrus meaning paper and the Latin word ferre meaning to bear in reference to the use of tree bark to make paper.Common name comes from a long-time use of the tree bark in eastern Asia to make paper and from the use of inner tree bark in Polynesia to make barkcloth (Tapa cloth).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Canker, leaf spot and root rot may be troublesome.
","
Garden Uses
Male trees can be effective shade or street trees because they will not spread by self-seeding or drop messy fruit.  Female trees can spread invasively into areas where they will crowd out native plants.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where plants are typically grown as shrubs or small trees to 15’ tall in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. In St. Louis, growing options include: (1) grow in large containers or tubs which must be overwintered indoors in bright, sunny locations or in greenhouses or (2) grow in the ground and lift plants in fall before first frost for overwintering in a cool, frost-free location (40 degrees F) with very minimal watering. During the growing season, plants are heavy feeders that need regular fertilization to stimulate new growth and flowers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Angel’s trumpet is a tropical shrub that, in the St. Louis area, typically matures to 5-10’ tall and features huge, nodding, trumpet-shaped, white flowers (to 12” long) from mid-summer to fall. Flowers emit a strong fragrance in evenings. Ovate to oblong leaves (to 8” long). In the first year, plants will typically grow to 3’ tall with minimal flowering. In the second year, plants will grow taller with more profuse flowering. Synonymous with and formerly known as Datura suaveolens.Genus name honors Sebald Justin Brugmans (1763-1819) a professor of natural history at Leiden.Specific epithet means sweet-scented.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for caterpillars, spider mites and whiteflies, particularly on overwintering plants. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade. Prefers consistently moist, organically rich soils in shady areas. Generally intolerant of dry soils, but tolerates some dryness better than most other cultivars of this species. Foliage may scorch in hot summer sun. Plants prefer cool summers, and generally will not perform well in the hot and humid summer conditions of the deep South (USDA Zones 7-9). Clumps slowly spread by creeping rhizomes to form thick ground covers. Plants may self seed in optimum growing conditions, but seedlings of variegated forms may not come true (may lose variegation).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brunnera macrophylla, commonly called Siberian bugloss, is a rhizomatous, clump-forming perennial that is primarily grown in shady areas for its attractive heart-shaped, dark green, basal foliage. Small, blue, forget-me-not-like flowers with white centers bloom in airy, branched racemes rising well above the foliage on slender stems to 18"" tall in spring. Basal leaves form a foliage mound which remains attractive throughout the growing season. Smaller upper leaves are elliptic.  

Brunnera macrophylla is synonymous with and sometimes sold as Anchusa myosotidiflora.Genus name honors Swiss botanist Samuel Brunner (1790-1844).Specific epithet from Latin means large leaved.Common name of bugloss comes from Greek meaning ox tongue in probable reference to the roughness and shape of the leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs and snails are occasional visitors.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Becomes weedy and sparse with diminished flowering performance in too much shade, however. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions including poor, somewhat dry soils, but is intolerant of wet conditions. Winter hardy to USDA Zone 5 where it usually does not suffer any significant winter die-back. Unlike Buddleja davidii, this species blooms on the previous year's wood, so cutting plants to the ground in late winter each year is not an option. Prune in late spring immediately after flowering. Weeping habit may be best showcased by training and growing this plant as a single trunk tree.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buddleja alternifolia is a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub or small single trunk tree which typically grows 8-15' tall (infrequently to 20' as a tree) with arching, drooping, willow-like branches. Tree form may superficially resemble a small weeping willow. Short clusters (to 3/4"" long) of lightly fragrant, lilac-purple flowers bloom in the leaf axils along the previous year's stems in spring. Flowers earlier than most other species of butterfly bush. Lance-shaped leaves (to 4"" long) are green above and grayish below. Unlike other cultivated species of Buddleja, this species has alternate leaves, hence the species and common names. Also sometimes commonly called fountain buddleia in reference to the growing habit. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.

The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia.  However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet refers to the alternate leaves of the species.Common name also refers to the alternate leaves of the species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Shrub borders, foundation plantings, cottage gardens or butterfly gardens. Interesting weeping specimen when trained as a single trunk tree.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Becomes weedy and sparse with diminished flowering performance if not grown in full sun. Does poorly in wet, poorly draining conditions. Will adapt to clay soil if properly amended. In USDA Zones 5 and 6, this plant will often die to the ground in winter and therefore is often grown therein in the manner of an herbaceous perennial.  Even if plants do not die to the ground in winter, they often grow more vigorously, produce superior flowers and maintain better shape if cut close to the ground in late winter each year.  Prompt removal of spent flower spikes during the growing season will usually encourage continued bloom until frost.  This shrub will naturalize, sometimes aggressively, by self-seeding (seed dispersed by wind), particularly in areas where it does not die back in winter.  Where self-seeding is a potential problem, remove spent flower clusters prior to formation/disbursement of seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buddleja davidii, commonly called butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub that is native to thickets on mountain slopes, limestone outcrops, forest clearings and rocky stream banks in China.  It typically grows to 6-12’ (less frequently to 15’) tall with a spread to 4-15’ wide when not killed back by cold winter temperatures.  It is noted for its bushy habit, arching stems, showy/fragrant flowers and vigorous growth.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in the eastern U.S. plus Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii.  It has been declared a noxious weed in Oregon and Washington.  Aggressive spreading has been observed in a number of eastern states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina.   

Spike-like terminal and axillary flower clusters bloom from early to late summer, sometimes to first frost.  Flowers are densely clustered in showy cone-shaped panicles from 6-18” long.  In the wild, straight species flowers are lilac to purple with orange-yellow throats.  Numerous named cultivars have been introduced over the years, expanding the range of flower colors to include pinks, yellows, whites and reds.  Flowers (each to ½” long) are mildly fragrant, and, as the common name suggests, very attractive to butterflies.  Flowers are also very attractive to hummingbirds and bees.  Flowers give way to two-valved seed capsules that split open when ripe (about 50 seeds per capsule).  Finely toothed, elliptic to lanceolate leaves (6-10” long) taper to long points.  Leaves are sage green above and white tomentose beneath.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.

The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia.  However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet honors Pere Armand David (1826-1900), French missionary and naturalist, who found this species growing in China in 1869/1870 along the border of China and Tibet.Common name refers to the plant being very attractive to butterflies.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for spider mites. Nematodes can be troublesome in the South.
","
Garden Uses
Provides excellent summer to fall flowers when few other shrubs are in bloom.  Best grown in borders, cottage gardens, rose gardens or butterfly gardens.  Foundations.  Popular fresh cut flower. Usually does not make a good single specimen shrub.Straight species plants are not sold in commerce.  Numerous cultivars are available.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.  Best grown in sunny tropical locations.  Best performance occurs in deep, fertile, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Add surface mulch.  Needs consistent moisture, but soils should begin to dry as winter approaches to encourage leaf drop by the beginning of winter.  Plants should be sited in areas protected from strong winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Butea monosperma, commonly called flame-of-the-forest or bastard teak, is a medium sized deciduous tree of the pea family that is native to humid lowland forested areas of India and Sri Lanka.  It typically matures to 30-40’ tall.  This tree features:  (a) leathery medium to dark green compound trifoliate leaves (to 10-18” wide), each having three rhombus-shaped leaflets held by a long petiole; (b) leaf drop occurring in early winter;  (c) black flower buds forming in mid-winter on leafless stems; (c) bicolor orange/red flowers (each to 2” long) blooming in dense clusters (racemes to 6” long) from late January to March;  (d)  flowers giving way to fruits (flat single-seeded pods to 3-4” long) which emerge pale green but mature to bronze-brown.      

Flowers often produce an outstanding late winter bloom.  Each flower has 5 petals, two wings and a beak-shaped keel purportedly resembling a curved parrot’s beak.  Trees may not flower if winters are too cold or too dry or too wet.  

Butea seeds, leaves, gum, and flowers all have medicinal properties.Genus name honors John Stuart the third Earl of Bute (1713-1792).Specific epithet means one-seeded.Flame-of-the-forest common name is in reference to the orange and red flower colors which purportedly mimic the colors of fire.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Butia capitata, commonly called yatay palm, pindo palm or jelly palm, is a palm tree that typically grows to 20-35’ tall and to 10-15’ wide.  It is native from southern Brazil to Paraguay.  This palm is noted for its (a) comparatively short but stout solitary trunk (to 15’ long and 1.5’ diameter) which is usually covered with persistent leaf bases from the stalks of fallen leaves, (b) arching, thick-textured, marginally-spined pinnate leaves (8-10’ long) that often form a dense but loose crown, each leaf having 25-60 pairs of narrow pointed leaflets which are usually grayish green, but sometimes deep green or silvery blue, (c) axillary flower clusters bearing tiny, yellowish, fruity-scented, unisexual flowers of both sexes (male with 6 stamens and female with 3 stigmas and a solitary pistil), and (d)  orange, rounded, edible fruits (each to 1” wide) with a fibrous but juicy flesh surrounding a hard stone.

This species is frequently planted in the warmer parts of the U.S., as far north as South Carolina and San Francisco. 

Sweet fruit pulp is used to make jellies or fermented to make wine.Genus name comes from the vernacular name in Brazil for a species of palm (B. capitata).Specific epithet means growing in a dense head.

Culture
Easily grown in evenly moist, well-drained sandy loams in full sun to part shade.  Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun.  Plants can grow in close to full shade, but typically are less vigorous and more open with decreased foliage density.  When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to scorch, bronze in winter or suffer from mite attacks.  Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.  Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing.  Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date.  Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost.  Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots.  Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2”).  Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation.  Boxwood is best sited in locations sheltered from strong winds, with, if possible, some protection from full winter sun.  Foliage may bronze in winter when exposed to half day to full day sun.  Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing.  Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus balearica, commonly known as Balearic boxwood, Spanish boxwood or Giant boxwood, is a rounded to broad-rounded shrub which typically grows in cultivation to 6-12’ tall, but in the wild, may grow as a small tree to as much as 25’ tall.  It is native to sandy soils and rocky slopes in the Mediterranean region from Spain and France to Turkey and Algeria, including of course the Balearic Islands (autonomous division of Spain) in the northeast Mediterranean (largest island being Mallorca).  

Elliptic, simple, opposite, smooth-margined, glossy, evergreen leaves (each to 1 3/4” long) are dark green above and pale green beneath.  Tiny, apetulous, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in April-May in axillary clusters.  Fruit is a globose dehiscent capsule.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Specific epithet is in reference to the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean east of Spain in reference to one of its native territories.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood to make boxes.  Another theory on common name is that boxwood describes the quadrangular (square box cross section) stems of young plants.
","
Problems
Boxwood can be somewhat temperamental to grow in the St. Louis area where its evergreen foliage tends to bronze (turn unattractive brownish-yellow) in harsh winters, particularly if plants are located in open areas exposed to full sun and winter winds.  Otherwise, boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning.  No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot.  Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils.  The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid.  In the deep South, nematodes are of concern.  New growth is particularly susceptible to winter damage.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where it is easily grown in evenly moist but well-drained loams (e.g., sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade.  Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun.  When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to bronze in winter.  Limited cold tolerance.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Should be grown in a protected location sheltered from strong winds in the northern parts of Zone 7 where it is marginally winter hardy.  Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing.  True species may be winter hardy to Zone 8, but B. harlandii of gardens (form of B. microphylla - see below) may have slightly better winter hardiness.  

Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.  Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing.  Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date.  Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost.  Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus harlandii, commonly known as Harland boxwood, is a small, bushy, multi-stemmed broadleaf evergreen shrub with a rounded vase-shaped form.  It typically grows to 2-3’ (infrequently to 5’) tall and as wide.  It is native to southern China where it is often found growing in open wooded areas and stream margins.  Bright green leaves are oblanceolate to obovate-oblong (to 1.25” long).  Each leaf has an indentation at the leaf tip.  Fragrant pale yellow flowers bloom in April–May.  Staminate flowers are stalked but pistilate ones are sessile. Attractive white trunk accents.

Many plants sold in North America under this species name are in reality forms of Buxus microphylla.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood of some plants in he genus to make boxes.  Another theory on common name is that the name is in reference to young plant stems which are quadrangular (square box cross section).

Culture
Easily grown as a submerged aquatic, either anchored or free-floating, in water gardens in full sun. Set plants out in pots or containers at the bottom of the water body or float plant cuttings/fragments in the water. Plant roots may be anchored in the muddy bottoms of small ponds. Remove or clip stems as needed to control plant populations. Plants spread rapidly and can be difficult to control in larger bodies of water, but are relatively easy to control in small water gardens.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cabomba caroliniana, commonly called fanwort or Carolina watershield, is a submerged aquatic perennial that has become a popular ornamental plant for water gardens and aquariums. Its bright green feathery foliage is quite attractive. By absorbing nutrients, plants help control algae and keep waters clear. Branching stems to 6’ long are densely clad with opposite, fan-shaped leaves that are finely divided into numerous filiform segments. Small linear-oblong peltate floating leaves are sparsely located at the branch ends and rest on the water surface in a manner somewhat reminiscent of tiny water lilies (Cabomba was formerly included in the water lily family). White-petaled flowers (1/2” across) rise slightly above the water surface on long stems growing from the leaf axils. Each flower petal has two yellow spots near the base. Flowers bloom May to September. Colonies in the wild provide cover for fish, small crustaceans, insect larvae and snails. Fanwort is native to the southeastern U. S., but has spread to now range from Massachusetts to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it is primarily found in swamps and sloughs and backwaters in the southeast lowland region and in floodplain areas near the juncture of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers (Steyermark).Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the native Guiana name for these perennial aquatic plants.Specific epithet means coming form North or South Carolina.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be an aggressive spreader.
","
Garden Uses
Water gardens. Not recommended for large ponds where population control can be more difficult. Large aquariums.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-11 (perhaps Zone 7 in a protected location) where it is easily grown in medium moisture, moderately fertile, well drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade, but best flowers occur in full sun.  Established plants have good drought tolerance.  Prune to shape as needed.  Generally survives temperatures to 30 degrees F. (sometimes with brief dips into the high 20s).   Often propagated by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caesalpinia gilliesii, commonly called bird-of-paradise, is an evergreen (semi-deciduous to deciduous in the northern parts of its growing range) shrub or small tree in the pea family that typically grows to 10’ tall but occasionally rises to as much as 15’.  It is native to subtropical areas of Argentina and Uruguay, but is now widely grown in tropical and warm temperate regions around the world for its attractive yellow flowers with bright red stamens which bloom in summer in upright open racemes on branches clad with fern-like bipinnate compound green leaves.  It was introduced into the southwestern U.S. a number of years ago where it has now escaped gardens and naturalized from California and Nevada to Oklahoma and Texas plus Georgia.   It is unrelated to Strelitzia reginae of South Africa which is a smaller clump-forming perennial that is also commonly known as bird-of-paradise.  

Each leaf (4-8” long) has 8-12 pairs of pinnae with each pinna having 7-11 pairs of elliptic leaflets (each to 1/2” long). Bruised foliage often has an unpleasant smell.  Five-petaled, pale yellow flowers (to 4-5” long), each featuring 10 showy red stamens, bloom in open terminal racemes in summer (July-August).  Flower is about 1” long, but the stamens protrude from the flower tube for another 3-4”.  Fruits are curved, flattened, linear to sickle-shaped, 8-10 seeded pods (each to 2-5” long) which split open at maturity to explosively expel seeds in all directions, thus facilitating naturalization in the landscape.Genus name honors Andrea Cesalpini (1524/25-1603), Italian botanist, philosopher, and physician to Pope Clement VIII.Specific epithet honors John Gillies (1792-1834), Scottish naval surgeon, who collected plants in Chile and Argentina.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caesalpinia pulcherrima, commonly called peacock flower or Barbados Pride, is a fast-growing upright shrub or small tree which typically matures to 10' tall (in shrub form) or to as much as 20' tall (in tree form).  It is native to tropical America (probably the West Indies), but is now widely grown in tropical areas around the world for its long bloom of colorful flowers in upright racemes on prickly branches clad with twice pinnate green leaves.  Bowl-shaped 5-petaled flowers (to 2"" wide) bloom spring to fall (year-round in tropical climates) in 4-8"" long terminal racemes (to 40 flowers per raceme) located at the branch ends.  Flowers feature bright orange-yellow petals with contrasting elongated dark red stamens.  Another common name for this shrub is dwarf poinciana in recognition of the similarity (although of smaller size) of the flowers of this shrub to the flowers of royal poinciana (Delonix regia).  Feathery, twice pinnate green leaves are usually evergreen, but sometimes deciduous in areas near the edge of its growing range.  Each leaf has 5-8 pairs of pinnae and 6-10 pairs of leaflets per pinna.  Flowers are followed by oblong, flat fruits (seed pods to 2.5-4"" long), with each pod containing 8-10 dark brown to black seeds which are ejected as the pod splits open at maturity.  This shrub has sharp prickles along its stems, leading to the sometimes used common name of Barbados flower fence because of its use in the West Indies as a flowering barrier fence.  Green seed pods are cooked and eaten in Mexico.Genus name honors Andrea Cesalpini (1524/25-1603), Italian botanist, philosopher, and physician to Pope Clement VIII.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pulcher meaning beauty.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, humusy, organically rich, acidic soils in part shade or filtered sun. Does well in bright shade. Avoid direct sun where leaves will scorch. Tubers may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, however, tubers should be started indoors in early spring, planted outside directly in the ground or in containers after threat of frost has past, dug up in fall immediately after foliage die back/first frost and then overwintered in a dry location (set in dry peat or wood shavings) where temperatures do not dip below 45 degrees F, in somewhat the same manner as done for tuberous begonias. Container plants may be stored indoors in the containers. When growing plants in garden soils, provide regular moisture, especially during dry summer periods, and do not allow soils to dry out. Plants also appreciate regular fertilization. St. Louis summer temperatures are ideal for caladiums: hot and humid with nighttime temperatures rarely dipping below 60 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caladium bicolor, commonly called caladiums or angel wings, are arum family members that are grown exclusively for their bold and colorful foliage. Calla-type flowers, if present, are usually hidden. Plants typically grow in clumps to 1-2.5' tall. Arrowhead-shaped leaves (to 1.5' long) are various shades of green mottled and blotched with pink, red, white or combinations thereof often with distinctively colored veins. Synonymous with C. x hortulanum.Genus name comes from the Latinized Malay plant-name kaladi.Specific epithet means of two colors.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaves are rather fragile and may easily be damaged by wind or hail. Slugs and snails may chew holes in the foliage.

Culture
Easily grown in slightly acidic to slightly alkaline, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers evenly moist soils, but tolerates some drought. Tolerates light shade in the afternoon. May spread in the garden by rhizomes and/or self-seeding to form an interesting ground cover. Stems may root at the nodes where they touch the ground. Shear or cut back plants after flowering to tidy the planting, to remove unsightly foliage and/or to prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Easily started from seed. Plants generally do not perform well in the deep South below USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calamintha nepeta is a bushy, rhizomatous, perennial herb of the mint family that is native to Europe and the Mediterranean region. It typically forms a dense, indefinitely spreading, foliage mat with upright leafy flowering stems rising to 12-18” tall. Ovate, gray-green leaves (to 3/4” long) are very fragrant when crushed. Tiny, tubular, two-lipped, lilac to white flowers appear in axillary spikes (cymes to 15 flowers each) over a long June-September bloom period. Flowers are attractive to bees.Genus name comes from Greek kalos meaning beautiful and mimthe meaning mint. Kalaminthe means savory.Specific epithet is in reference to the resemblance of the plant to catnip.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage may decline in hot and humid summer climates such as the St. Louis area.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent edging plant for walks, patios or herb gardens. Also effective when sprawled over low retaining walls or in containers. Rock gardens or border fronts.

Culture
Best grown in moist to wet soils in full sun.  Tolerates part shade but begins to lose its form in too much shade, growing more openly and falling over.  In the wild, plants typically root in sandy alluvium between rocks along small rivers and streams.  Grows in clumps which may spread by rooting at the nodes.   Clumps may be cut back to the ground in late winter to early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calamovilfa arcuata, commonly known as Cumberland reed grass, is a riverine sandgrass whose growth in the wild is limited to a few scattered populations found in sunny locations along flood-scoured exposures of bedrock, cobble and gravel along streams or small rivers located in the Cumberland Plateau area of Kentucky, Tennessee and northern Alabama.  Several disjunct populations may also be found in a small area of southeastern Oklahoma and adjacent western Arkansas.  Typical habitat is rocky stream/river banks and cobble/gravel bars (sometimes called river scour prairies) which are kept open and maintained by periodic flooding.  Flood water will wash over these areas scouring out certain species of plants (including potentially invasive ones) that are simply not adapted to this type of environment.  Many grasses, flowering herbs and low shrubs live in these harsh conditions, but larger woody plants and trees are scarce.  Cumberland reed grass was first discovered by K. E. Rogers in Cumberland County, Tennessee in 1970.  The total number of populations of this rare species today probably does not exceed 60.  

Cumberland reed grass typically grows in clumps to 3-4 1/2’ tall. It features short, compact rhizomes, glabrous stems, culm nodes with fine hairs, and leaf blades (each to 12-34” long) with sharp downward pointed teeth.  Leaves are clustered near the bottom of the plant.  Inflorescence is a panicle with narrow raceme-like or spike-like branches.  Flowers bloom in August-September.  Cumberland reed grass is similar in appearance to Tridens flavus (purpletop) and Panicum virgatum (switch grass).Genus name comes from the Greek word kalamos meaning reed and vilfa meaning a genus of grass.Specific epithet is in reference to the arcuate (curved) florets of this grass.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  The survival of this sandgrass in the wild depends in large part on freely flowing unpolluted streams.   Construction of reservoirs or dams or alteration of streambanks affecting the water flow or water pollution can significantly alter and in some cases destroy downstream cobble bars and plant communities living thereon.  Basically any alteration of the streambanks, sandbars and/or water flow must be avoided.
","
Garden Uses
May be very difficult to locate this reed grass in commerce.  Homeowners may have difficulty locating a good habitat for this plant on residential real estate.

Culture
With good humidity, consistent soil moisture, warm air temperatures, and an absence of direct sun, this tropical perennial will usually develop into an extremely attractive indoor foliage plant.  Best indoor container growth typically occurs in uniformly moist, well-drained, peaty potting mixtures in room temperatures ranging from 65 to 75 degrees F. in bright shade locations.  Avoid full sun, particularly in the heat of the afternoon.  Tolerates some early morning sun or diffused sun.  Plants need high humidity which can often be difficult to provide in winter.  Consider standing a potted plant on a bed of wet pebbles, misting the foliage regularly and/or growing the plant in a humidified room.  Water regularly to keep soils moist (but not wet) during the growing season.  Reduce watering in winter when plant growth typically slows down.  Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calathea zebrina, commonly known as zebra plant, is noted for its striking ornamental leaves which feature zebra-like stripes as suggested by both the specific epithet and the common name.  This is a compact, rhizomatous, evergreen perennial that typically grows to 1-3’ tall in containers.  It is native to tropical areas of southeastern Brazil.  Leaves (to 12” long or more) rise on long petioles from basal rosettes to form a foliage clump.  Leaves are velvety dark green highlighted by showy, broad, parallel chartreuse stripes or bars which extend along the veins from the mid-vein to the leaf margins in a zebra-like configuration.  Leaf undersides are reddish-purple.  Leaves fold together at dusk in a manner somewhat resembling praying hands, hence the sometimes used common name of prayer plant.  Inconspicuous, white to purple flowers bloom in spring on upright stalks, but flowers rarely bloom on indoor plants.Genus name comes from the Latin word calathus meaning basket in reference to the inflorescence looking like a basket of flowers.Specific epithet is in reference to the zebra-like stripes found on plant leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, scale, mealybugs and spider mites.   Leaf spots may appear.  Plants do not thrive in low humidity where leaves may roll or turn brown.   Direct sun usually causes leaf scorch.
","
Garden Uses
This plant is grown for its attractive foliage.   Houseplant for bright areas with no direct sun.  Popular landscape plant in Hawaii.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants generally appreciate some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area, but become leggy in too much shade. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date or sow directly in the garden just before last frost date. Set seedlings or purchased starter plants out after last frost date. Young plants may be pinched back to encourage compact bushy growth. Deadhead spent flowers to promote additional bloom. If plants begin to languish in prolonged hot summer weather, cut back to promote fall flowering. Plants often will not last the growing season in hot St. Louis summers. May reseed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calendula officinalis, commonly called pot marigold, is a popular annual that is grown in beds and borders for its daisy or chrysanthemum-like bright yellow to deep orange flowers which in cool climates appear over a long summer to fall bloom period. Cultivars expand the available flower colors to include many pastel shades and some bicolors. Single to double flowerheads (3-4” diameter) may have contrasting darker center disks. The species is an Old World potherb and garden plant that was quite popular in England at the time of Shakespeare. It typically grows 1-2’ tall and as wide. Although the flowers and leaves are somewhat bitter tasting, they are edible and may be added fresh or dried to soups, salads or rice dishes for both color and flavor. Aromatic, lance-shaped to oblong-obovate green leaves (to 6” long).Genus name comes from the Latin word calendae meaning the first day of the month.Specific epithet means sold in shops. Frequently applied to plants believed to have medicinal properties.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to powdery mildew. Watch for slugs and snails, particularly on young plants. Aphids and whiteflies are occasional visitors.

Culture
Best grown in acidic, humus-rich, muddy (moist to wet) soils in part shade.  Plants tolerate close to full shade, but may become weak-stemmed and lean.  Plants will grow in still shallow water (to 2"" over the crown) with leaves out of the water.   Propagate by seed or rhizome division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calla palustris, commonly known as water arum or wild calla, is native to bogs, marshes, pond peripheries, slow-moving stream margins, seepages and swamps in Alaska, Canada and the northern U. S. from New England and New York west to northern Illinois and North Dakota.  It is in the arum family and closely related to jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) which is also native to eastern North America.  Water arum is a small plant that typically grows to 6-12"" tall.  Smooth, waxy, broad-oval, heart-shaped leaves (to 6"" long) with inward curling margins and pointed tips appear on long petioles (leaf stalks) rising from shallow creeping rhizomes to as much as 10"" tall.  From the center of the leaf stalks rises a single flower in late spring on a stout stem to 4-12"" tall.  Each flower consists of a showy, flattened, oval white spathe (to 3"" tall) that partially encircles a shorter, inner, upright-cylindrical, yellow-green flower spike known as the spadix.  The spadix is covered with apetalous yellow true flowers which bloom in June.  Flowers on the spadix are followed by tiny pear-shaped fruits (berries to 1/2"" long) that ripen to bright red.Genus name presumably comes from the Greek word kallos meaning beauty.Specific epithet means marsh-loving.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where it is best grown in moist, fertile soils in full sun. Likes high humidity. Tolerates wide range of soils including somewhat poor ones. Keep soils consistently moist. For the St. Louis area, grow in containers that should be overwintered indoors in a bright cool sun room or greenhouse.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calliandra haematocephala, commonly called red powder puff, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Bolivia. It was formerly included in the legume or pea family, but has recently been shifted into the mimosa family. It typically grows 10-15’ tall in its native habitat and is a very popular flowering shrub in central and southern Florida where it will survive year-round in the ground. Bipinnately compound leaves (5-10 pairs of leaflets per pinna) open copper-pink but mature to dark green. Raspberry-like flower buds open to hemispherical red powder puff flower heads (to 3” across) consisting of masses of scarlet stamens. Blooms primarily in fall and winter, but sporadic additional bloom may occur throughout the rest of the year. Variations in flower color exist, with some pink and white forms being available.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalli- meaning beautiful and aner or andros meaning male, hence a stamen in reference to the flower's many stamens.Specific epithet means blood-red head in reference to the flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for caterpillars, spider mites and aphids.

Culture
This native plant prefers the soil of its natural forest floor habitat - a moist clay or sand enriched with organic matter. It will fruit most abundantly in full sun but may be grown in light shade. The plant needs minimal care once its roots are established. Since Missouri is at the northern edge of beautyberry's range, the foliage will be killed back to the ground in most winters. This will not affect the flowering as the plant blooms on new growth. In warmer areas, this shrub may be pruned back to about 2' less than the desired size. Propagate by cuttings or from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Callicarpa americana, commonly called beautyberry, is a loose open shrub valued for its spectacular fruits. The relatively insignificant flowers develop into prolific bright violet to magenta berry-like drupes which encircle the stem. These fruits remain attractive for a long time although they are generally gone before severe winter weather.Genus name comes from Greek meaning beautiful fruit.Specific epithet means of the Americas.
","
Problems
Beautyberry is relatively disease and pest free.
","
Garden Uses
The size and loose open habit of beautyberry makes it best for the back of a shrub border where it may be massed in large landscapes or where it may be naturalized. Beautyberry plants are said to bear more fruit if several are planted together.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best flowering and fruiting is in full sun. Stems can become leggy in too much shade. Some tolerance for drought. Flowers bloom on new wood. Prune as needed in early spring. Most gardeners prefer to prune stems back to 6” in late winter to early spring each year. Such hard pruning tends to promote shrub compactness and good flowering. In harsh USDA Zone 5 winters, stems may die back to the ground in winter with new growth emerging from the roots in spring. Best cross-pollination and resultant fruit production occur when shrubs are planted in groups or massed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Callicarpa dichotoma, commonly called beautyberry, is a small, rounded, deciduous shrub which typically grows 2-4' tall and is primarily included in the landscape for its showy fall display of lilac-violet fruit. Long, arching, slender branches dip downward often to touch the ground. Clusters (cymes) of small, pink to lavender flowers bloom in the leaf axils along the stems in summer. Flowers are followed by clusters of lilac-violet fruits (each 1/8"" diameter) which ripen in September and put on their best show through October. Fruits persist beyond the point of leaf drop but not very far into winter. Elliptic to obovate green leaves (1-3"" long) turn yellow in fall. One of the best ornamental fruiting shrubs.Genus name comes from Greek meaning beautiful fruit.Specific epithet means forked in pairs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spot, stem diseases and black mold. May suffer significant stem dieback or die to the ground in harsh winters.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Callirhoe alcaeoides, commonly called poppy mallow, is an erect to sometimes sprawling, slender-stemmed perennial which is native to dry rocky or sandy soils in plains and barrens from Illinois to Nebraska south to Texas and Alabama, including parts of the central and southern Great Plains.  In Missouri, it is typically found in prairies, roadsides, grassy open areas and waste ground in scattered locations throughout the State (Steyermark).  This poppy mallow typically grows to 12-20"" tall.  Cup-shaped, upward-facing, poppy-like, 5-petaled flowers (to 2.5” wide), which lack underlying bracts, bloom from the leaf axils over a long May to August period.   Flowers are usually solitary, but sometimes appear in small clusters.  Flowers are white, light pink or pale lilac, but never in darker shades of rose-wine to purple which are the colors of the similar Callirhoe involucrata.  Upper leaves (to 2-3"" long) are palmately divided into 5-7 lobed segments.  Ovate lower leaves have shallower lobes.Genus name honors the daughter of a minor Greek deity, Achelous, a river god.

Long tap root gives this plant good drought tolerance but makes transplanting of established plants difficult.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Callirhoe bushii, commonly called Bush’s poppy mallow, is an uncommon herbaceous perennial that is native to approximately 50 scattered locations in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. In Missouri, it is primarily found in rocky open woods, wooded valleys, ravine bottoms and glade borders in five counties in the southeast corner of the state (Steyermark). Plants typically grow 12-18” tall from a thick rootstock. Upward facing cup-shaped five-petaled, magenta flowers bloom in summer (June-August). Rambling flower stems are somewhat more erect than those of the similar C. involucrata. Stamens form a prominent central column typical of mallow family members. Leaves are palmately divided into 5-7 finger-like lobes. Synonymous with and formerly known as C. involucrata var. bushii and C. papaver var. bushii.Genus name honors the daughter of a minor Greek deity, Achelous, a river god.Specific epithet honors botanist Benjamin Franklin Bush (1858-1937).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Callirhoe triangulata, commonly called clustered poppy mallow, is a generally erect perennial that is native to the deep South (Alabama to North Carolina) and Midwest (Missouri to Wisconsin and Indiana). In Missouri, it has been recorded in the past as growing in four counties (St. Louis, Scott, Franklin and Mississippi) in dryish, rocky or sandy soils in prairies, open woods, sandy open ground and limestone glades (Steyermark). However, it is very rare and possibly extinct in Missouri today. Stems, leaves and flower stalks are hairy. Basal leaves are triangular. Stem leaves are narrower and sometimes lobed. Plants typically grow 1-3’ tall on slender, branching stems. Five-petaled, deep rose-purple flowers (to 2” wide) bloom in clusters at the ends of long axillary stalks. Stamens and style form a prominent central column typical of mallow family members. Blooms in summer (July and August). The closely related purple poppy mallow (Callirhoe involucrata) is, by contrast, a procumbent, mat-forming plant.Genus name honors the daughter of a minor Greek deity, Achelous, a river god.Specific epithet means with three angles referring to the lower leaves.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Callistemon citrinus, commonly called scarlet bottlebrush, lemon bottlebrush or red bottlebrush, is native to Australia. It is a large evergreen upright tropical shrub that will grow to 10-15’ tall in its native habitat. It is commonly grown as a specimen or hedge in frost free areas such as southern Florida and parts of southern California. It can also be trained as a tree to 25’ tall. In containers in northern climates, it more commonly is grown as a 3-5’ tall shrub or trained as a small standard. Flowers feature numerous bushy bright red stamens in rounded to cylindrical spikes (to 4” long) that resemble bottlebrushes. Flowers bloom intermittently throughout the year in frost free areas, but more typically in summer in St. Louis. Flowers are attractive to bees. Lance-shaped to narrow-elliptic leaves (to 3” long) emerge coppery before maturing to medium green. Leaves have a lemony scent when bruised, hence the species name.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalli- meaning beautiful and stemon  meaning a stamen for the beauty of the flower.Specific epithet means resembling citron.

Culture
Cool weather annual. Easily grown in rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Set seedlings and/or purchased starter plants out after last frost date. In the alternative, sow seed directly in the garden after last frost date with several additional plantings thereafter at two week intervals. Day-neutral plants will bloom earlier. Do not allow soils to dry out. Plants appreciate good air circulation. Tall flowers may need staking or other support.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Callistephus chinensis, commonly called China aster, is a popular annual that provides showy, 3-5-inch diameter blooms from early summer to fall on plants clad with ovate, toothed, medium green leaves. Species plants are infrequently grown because of the huge number of superior cultivars that have arisen over the years. Cultivar height ranges from 8-inch dwarfs to 36-inch tall plants. Cultivar appearance varies from single daisy-like flower heads with yellow centers to fully double flower heads with shaggy to pompom form. Cultivar colors include shades of white to pink, red, blue, violet, purple and yellow.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalli- meaning beautiful and stephos meaning a crown in reference to the flowers.Specific epithet means Chinese
","
Problems
Aphids and spider mites may appear. Plants are susceptible to some significant disease problems including (1) aster yellows (spray if necessary to control leafhoppers), (2) aster wilt and (3) stem rot. Site plants in different locations from year to prevent transmission of diseases from the soil. Dig up and destroy diseased plants.

Culture
Grow in moist, acidic, humusy, somewhat lean, sandy or gravelly, very well-drained soils of average fertility in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in full sun (better flowering), but may appreciate some part afternoon light shade in hot summer climates. Scotch heather prefers a moist and cool climate. It generally dislikes the high heat/humidity of the Midwest and deep South and is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 6. It also dislikes the heavy clay soils commonly found in the St. Louis area. Plants need regular and consistent moisture and should not be allowed to dry out. Do not site plants in locations exposed to strong winds. Mulch with peat moss. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow root systems. Prune in spring before new growth appears. Older shrubs often become leggy and unkempt, and appreciate an annual spring pruning.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calluna vulgaris, commonly called Scotch heather, heather or ling, is a small, variably-sized, evergreen shrub that is native primarily to moors, dunes, bogs, heaths and hillsides from northern and western Europe to Siberia, Turkey and Morocco. It has naturalized in parts of North America, particularly in the northeastern U.S. and the Northwest. In optimum growing conditions, it will typically form thick mats of foliage. Tiny, four-ranked, scale-like leaves in overlapping pairs appear on slender stems rising on average to 24” tall. However cultivars appear in a wider range of sizes including prostrate forms with small tufts to only 4” tall. Leaves are typically gray to green in spring and summer but acquire bronze to purple tones in fall and winter. Rose pink to purplish pink flowers in terminal, one-sided, spike-like racemes appear in mid to late summer. The Royal Horticultural Society currently lists over 800 cultivars of this species.Genus name comes from the Greek word kalluno meaning to cleanse or adorn. Plants were used for making brooms.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
Watch for spider mites and oystershell scale. Stem and root rot may occur, particularly during warm and humid summer weather.
","
Garden Uses
Smaller varieties are useful as ground covers or in the rock garden. More erect shrubs are effective when planted in mass on hillsides. Also may be sited in borders and as background plants. Scotch heather generally combines well with dwarf conifers and deciduous shrubs.

Culture
Best grown in deep, moderately fertile, moist but well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Appreciates a location protected from drying winter winds. Tolerates shearing. Although native to western North America, this incense cedar does very well in the East and is surprisingly tolerant of summer heat and humidity.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calocedrus decurrens, commonly called incense cedar, is an aromatic evergreen conifer with upright branching that is narrow-columnar in youth but may broaden with age to conical sometimes with a rounded crown. It is native to the Cascades, Sierras and coastal ranges, usually scattered in mixed conifer forest on western slopes, from Oregon to California, southwestern Nevada and northern Baja California. In the wild, it may grow to 100-150’ and live to 1000+ years. In cultivation, it typically grows shorter to 30-50’ tall. Flattened branchlets in fern-like sprays are covered with overlapping, lustrous, rich green, scale-like foliage in whorls of four. Foliage has an incense-like aroma when crushed. Reddish-brown, deeply-furrowed, scaly bark appears on mature trees. Solitary fruiting cones (to 1” long) ripen in summer at the branchlet ends. Although small, cones are very distinctive and are commonly described as resembling duckbills when they open to release their seed. Synonymous with and formerly known as Libocedrus decurrens.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalos meaning beautiful and cedrus meaning cedar tree.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calotropis gigantea, commonly called crown flower or giant milkweed, is a large shrub or small tree that is native to India, southern China, Malaysia and Indonesia, but has been extensively cultivated in tropical areas around the world.  This milkweed family member typically grows to 8-15' tall.  It is noted for its upright growth, milky sap, pale purple or white crown-like flowers, and white wooly shoots and leaves which mature to subglabrous.   Flowers appear in clusters (umbellate cymes) throughout the year, but primarily in summer.  Flowers (both white and purple) are commonly used in Hawaii for leis.  Elliptic to oblong leaves (to 4-8"" long) have cordate bases.  Fruits infrequently form.  This giant milkweed is an important larval plant for monarch butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalos meaning beautiful and tropos meaning boat in reference to the flowers.Specific epithet means unusually tall or large.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Sap in eyes can cause severe inflammation.  Sap is also an irritant to mucus membranes.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, grow as a hedge or train as a small tree.  Where not winter hardy, grow in containers which must be overwintered indoors.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11.  Thrives in dry to medium soils in full sun to part shade.  Salt tolerant.  Also tolerates poor soils.  Propagate by seed or cuttings.  Seed pods split open when ripe discharging seed.  Remove developing seed pods before they split open to prevent possible invasive spread of wind-blown seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calotropis procera, commonly called small crownflower or giant milkweed, is an upright, spreading, milky-sapped, evergreen shrub or small tree of the milkweed family.  It typically grows to 6-8’ (rarely to as much as 15’) tall.  By contrast, Calotropis gigantea (crownflower) is a similar but taller-growing species that typically rises to 15’ tall.   Small crownflower is native to Africa, Madagascar, Arabian Peninsula, Southern Asia, and Indochina.   It has been introduced and has naturalized in parts of Australia, a number of Pacific Islands, Central and South America, and most Caribbean Islands.  In the U. S., it has naturalized in California and Hawaii.  It typically grows in open habitats including overgrazed pastures, rangeland, roadsides, river flats and coastal dunes.  

Noteworthy features include:  (a) oblong-obovate to nearly orbicular, light to dark green (sometimes gray-green) leaves (to 3-7” long by 2-5” wide) with short-pointed to blunt apices, nearly clasping cordate bases and dull white veins; (b) waxy, shallowly campanulate (crown-like) flowers (to 1” diameter), each having a five-parted calyx, bell-shaped corolla with 5 broad lobes, and a corona (crown) of five fleshy scales.  Flowers bloom in umbel-like clusters (umbellate cymes) throughout the year, with color ranging from white to pink with purple blotching; (c) corky furrowed gray bark; (d) milky white sap (latex) exudes whenever stems or leaves are cut (latex is a toxic irritant to skin, sinus and eyes); (e) fruits (to 4-5” long) are inflated oval pods containing numerous brown seeds with silky tufted white hairs (pappus).  Pods split open in fall to discharge the ripened seeds which easily spread by wind to new locations; (f) stout taproot; (g) wood yields a fibrous substance that has been used to make rope; and (h) larval plant for monarch butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalos meaning beautiful and tropos meaning boat in reference to the flowers.Specific epithet from Latin means tall.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids defoliate branches in some areas.  Sap in eyes can cause severe inflammations. Invasive in pastures, rangelands and hay fields.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, grow as a hedge or train as a small tree.  Where not winter hardy, grow in containers which must be overwintered indoors.  Could be grown as an annual where not winter hardy.

Culture
Grow in full sun to part shade in shallow water at the margins of a pond or water garden or in wet, boggy soils. Best flowering usually occurs in full sun, but plants appreciate some part shade in the heat of the summer. If sited in full sun in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area, plants may go dormant in summer. May be grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caltha palustris, commonly called marsh marigold, is a rhizomatous perennial that in North America is native to marshes, swamps, wet meadows and stream margins from Newfoundland to Alaska south to Nebraska, Tennessee and North Carolina. Unfortunately, the name marsh marigold is only descriptively accurate as to this plant’s habitat, because it neither looks like nor is related to marigolds (Aster family). It belongs to the buttercup family, and its shiny yellow flowers indeed look very much like buttercups. It typically grows 12-18” tall on hollow, branching stems. Bright yellow flowers (1-2” diameter) with 5-9 waxy deep yellow petal-like sepals bloom in spring (April to June). Flowers give way to seed pods which split open when ripe to disperse the seeds within. Long-stalked, rounded to cordate, glossy green basal leaves (to 7” across) attain mature size in summer well after flowering. Upper stem leaves are smaller and stalkless. Flower buds may be cooked and pickled in vinegar for use as a substitute for capers. Young leaves are also edible as cooked greens when boiled. No part of this plant should ever be eaten raw however.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a plant with a yellow flower, probably Calendula.Specific epithet means marsh-loving.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calycanthus floridus, commonly called Carolina allspice, is a dense, rounded deciduous shrub with a suckering habit which grows 6-9' (less frequently to 12') tall with an equal or slightly greater spread. Features very fragrant, brown to reddish-brown flowers (2"" across) which bloom at the ends of short branchlets in May. Flowers give way to brownish, urn-shaped fruits (seed capsules) which mature in fall and persist throughout the winter. Lustrous, dark green (pale beneath), ovate to elliptic leaves to 6"" long turn golden yellow in fall. Leaves are aromatic when bruised. Best to purchase this plant when in flower because the quality and intensity of the fragrance can vary widely from plant to plant. Also commonly called sweetshrub and strawberry bush in reference to the fragrant blooms which have been described as combining hints of pineapple, strawberry and banana. Further common name of hairy allspice is in reference to the hairy twigs and leaf undersides of this plant. U.S. native from Virginia to Florida.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalyx meaning calyx and anthos meaning a flower.Specific epithet means of Florida.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates close to full shade.  Grows somewhat taller in shade than in sun.  Tolerant of a wide range of soils, including sandy or clay, but prefers rich moist loams.  Prune immediately after flowering to shape and to maintain compactness.  Remove root suckers promptly if naturalization is not desired.  If planted in the St. Louis area (northern part of USDA Zone 6), it should be given a root mulch, sheltered location and protection from cold winter winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calycanthus occidentalis, commonly known as California sweetshrub or California spicebush, is a large, upright-rounded, thicket-forming, multi-stemmed, suckering, deciduous shrub which features fragrant (some suggest the aroma of a wine cellar), dark red to purplish-brown, thin-tepaled, waterlily-like flowers (2-3” wide) which bloom from late spring to early summer (sometimes extending to early fall).  Each flower is short-lived (1-2 days).  This shrub typically grows to 6-12’ (15’) tall and as wide.  It is endemic to California (possibly a few sites in the State of Washington) where it is typically found in moist shady places, canyons, and along streams and woodland lakes primarily from the southern Cascades, California coastal ranges and foothills of the Sierra Nevada.  Flowers give way to capsule-like fruits (to 2” long) which persist into winter.  Opposite, large, leathery, ovate to elliptic, dark green leaves (to 3-8” long) turn yellow in fall.  Leaves are also fragrant, being rough above and pubescent beneath. Blooms of C. occidentalis are considered to have less flower fragrance than the blooms of C. floridus.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalyx meaning calyx and anthos meaning a flower.Specific epithet means western in reference to this plant’s habitat in the western United States.Plants in the genus Calycanthus are commonly called sweetshrub or strawberry bush in reference to the fragrant blooms which are often described as combining hints of pineapple, strawberry and banana.

Culture
Best grown in dry, gravelly or sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. This is a taprooted plant that tolerates drought extremely well but can be difficult to transplant once established.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calylophus serrulatus, commonly called toothed evening primrose, is native to dry prairies and mesas in western North America, particularly in the Great Plains from Canada to Texas. It is a low, shrubby, woody-based perennial which typically grows from 6-18"" tall. Features narrow, lance-shaped, sessile leaves (to 2"" long) which are, as both the common name and specific epithet suggest, sharply toothed. Four-petaled, stalkless, yellow sundrop flowers (to 1"" wide) bloom mid-spring to mid-summer. Flowers give way to 1"" long seed capsules. Additional common names for this plant include serrate-leaved evening primrose (for toothed leaves), shrubby evening primrose (for woody-based, shrubby habit), plains yellow primrose (for where it grows) and halfleaf sundrop (for leaf length and sundrop-type flower). As with other sundrops (e.g., Oenothera pilosella), the flowers of this species do not just open in the evening, but are open for the entire day. Leaves of this interesting prairie plant line up with their edges facing the intense mid-day sun as an adaptive way of minimizing water loss in a manner similar to the way that compass plant leaves (Silphium laciniatum) line up on a north-south axis for the same purpose.Genus name is in reference to the lobes on the calyx.Specific epithet means with small saw-toothed leaves.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, acidic, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers full sun, but easily tolerates open woodland part shade conditions.  Plant bulbs 4-6” deep and 6” apart in fall.  Tolerates clay soils.  Plants need regular moisture during the periods of spring growth and bloom, but will tolerate drier conditions after bloom as the plants head for summer dormancy.  Best left undisturbed once planted.  Plants reproduce by bulb offsets and reseeding.  Cross-pollinated flowers form seed capsules containing several seeds.  Plants can be grown from seed, but will not bloom until the 3rd or 4th year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camassia angusta, commonly known as prairie camas, prairie hyacinth or wild hyacinth, is a spring-flowering, bulbous perennial of the lily family that typically produces one or more flowering stalks to 2 1/2’ tall which rise in spring from an upright to drooping basal foliage clump consisting of 6-12” long narrow, glabrous, linear to parallel-veined, strap-shaped, medium to dark green leaves (each to 14” long by 1” wide).  Each flowering stalk is topped by a terminal raceme (to 4-12” long) of lavender to pale purple flowers (each to 3/4” across) which bloom sequentially from bottom to top in late spring (May-June).  Each flower gives way to a 1/3” long seed capsule (2-5 seeds per locale).  Leaves turn yellow and wither after flowering as plant appearance declines on its way to mid-summer dormancy.

This is a true bulb that is native to prairies and rocky open ground from Illinois and Missouri south to Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  

C. angusta is very similar to the much more common C scilloides which blooms about one month earlier (April-May).Genus name is derived from the Native American Indian name of kamas or quamash for a genus plant whose bulb was once used by native Americans and settlers as a food source.Specific epithet from Latin means narrow in reference to the leaf width.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Plants stems are strong and seldom need support.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or plant in groups of at least 15 bulbs in wildflower meadows, open woodland areas or borders.  May not deserve a prominent place in the border, however, since foliage becomes rather scruffy in appearance after bloom on its way to mid-summer dormancy.  May also be utilized as an accent on the periphery of a water garden or pond.

In its native range in the Pacific Northwest, this plant is found in damp meadows and along the edges of ponds at elevations between 1000-2000 ft.  Will naturalize over time if given the proper soil and environmental conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camassia cusickii, or Cusick’s camass, is native to a few counties in northeast Oregon and western Idaho but can readily be found in cultivation for ornamental use in the home garden.  Numerous narrow, green, strap-like leaves, 10-20"" in length, emerge from the bulb in the spring forming a basal rosette, followed by the inflorescence.  The 1.5-2.5’ flowering stalk supports a terminal raceme made of sky blue to white flowers with showy, yellow anthers.  This bulb blooms in late spring to early summer.  Unlike other members of this genus, such as C. scilloides, this plant was not used as a food source by Native Americans.  The bulbs have a bitter taste and slimy texture.Genus name is derived from the Native American Indian name of kamas or quamash for a genus plant whose bulb was once used by native Americans and settlers as a food source.Specific epithet refers to William Conklin Cusick (1842-1922), a self-taught, American botanist who specialized in plants of the Pacific Northwest.
","
Problems
No serious insect pests or diseases reported.
","
Garden Uses
Can be planted along the edges of ponds, in an open woodland garden, wet meadow, or more formal border garden.   Massed plantings of these bulbs will create the greatest design impact.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Camassia leichtlinii, sometimes called Leichtlin’s camass, is a spring-flowering bulbous perennial that typically grows on moist slopes and moist mountain meadows west of the Cascades and Sierras from British Columbia to southern California.  Linear, strap-shaped leaves (up to 2’ long) typically form a 2’ clump of foliage.  Star-shaped flowers (2-3"" wide) in upright terminal racemes (20-80 flowers per raceme) open sequentially from bottom to top on stout, naked flowering stems that rise above the foliage clump to a height of 2.5-4’ tall in late spring.  Each flower has six showy petal-like tepals.  Flowers in this species may be white, cream, blue or purple, all with attractive yellow anthers.  Good fresh cut flower.Genus name is derived from the Native American Indian name of kamas or quamash for a genus plant whose bulb was once used by native Americans and settlers as a food source.Specific epithet honors Max Leichtlin (1831-1910) of Baden-Baden, Germany who introduced many plants into cultivation, notably from the Near East.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Camassia scilloides, commonly known as wild hyacinth, eastern camas or Atlantic camas, is a spring-flowering bulbous perennial that typically grows to 1-2’ (less frequently to 3’) tall.  It is native to a variety of habitats including low rich woods, wet open woodlands, open meadows, stream banks, limestone glades, ledges, rocky slopes and prairies, often on calcareous soils, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin south to Georgia and Texas.  

Narrow, linear, grass-like, sharp-pointed leaves (to 12” long by 1/2” wide) form a basal foliage clump from which rises a naked flowering stalk to 2’ tall topped by a terminal raceme (4-12” long) of fragrant, pale blue to white flowers which bloom sequentially from the bottom of the raceme to the top in April-May.  Each flower (to 1” across) has 6 linear to elliptic tepals, 6 yellow-anthered stamens, and a green ovary with a central style.  Each raceme typically holds up to 20 flowers.  Each fertilized flower gives way to a 1/3” seed capsule.  Basal leaves turn yellow and wither after flowering as plant appearance declines on its way to a mid-summer dormancy.  

Bulbs of several different species of Camas, including the within species, once served as an important food for several different native American Indian tribes plus early settlers and explorers of North America.  

The bulbs of C. scilloides are edible (raw, baked, roasted or boiled) and were once a significant food source for some native American Indians and early North American explorers/settlers.  However, it should be noted that the bulbs of a very similar plant commonly known as death camas (Zygadenus nuttallii) are very poisonous if ingested.  Unfortunately the bulbs of these two genuses are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other by observation.Genus name is derived from the Native American Indian name of kamas or quamash for a genus plant whose bulb was once used by native Americans and settlers as a food source.Specific epithet is in reference to a purported resemblance between plants of the genus Camassia with plants of the genus Scilla.

Culture
Camellia japonica and most of its cultivars are considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9.  Even where winter hardy, unusually cold temperatures in winter (below 10 degrees F), particularly when occurring as a sudden temperature change, can damage or sometimes kill these plants.  Japanese camellias may not be grown outdoors year round in the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6) except for a very limited number of recently developed cultivars which have displayed exceptional hardiness. 

Where winter hardy, Camellia japonica should be grown in moist, acidic (5.5 to 6.5 pH), loose, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade.  Consistent and even moisture is important.  Avoid wet soils.  Plants require protection from direct afternoon sun and wind.  Best location may be sun-dappled part shade.  Best with a root mulch.  Near the northern parts of their growing range, plants should be sited in sheltered and protected microclimates such as near the south side of a home or building.  Burlap wraps are sometimes helpful.  Plants generally dislike changes in temperature, irregular watering or being moved.  Even a change in humidity can cause plants to drop buds.  Fertilize monthly in spring and summer.  If desired, remove all but one bud from each cluster to increase the size of the flower.  Prune immediately after flowering.  

Container plants are an option for the St. Louis area and other places where plants are not winter hardy, but containers are typically not an effective option because camellias generally overwinter poorly in private residences where growing conditions and room temperatures cannot be controlled.   For container plants to thrive indoors, they must be overwintered in a temperature-controlled environment such as a greenhouse where maximum winter temperatures range from 45 to 55 degrees F.  Flower buds typically fall off where winter temperatures exceed 55 degrees F.  

A limited number of cultivars of this species are now temperature rated to USDA Zone 6, and may be grown outdoors all year in the St. Louis area in protected locations around homes, foundations and patios.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camellia japonica, commonly called Japanese camellia, is an evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-12’ tall on stems clad with oval, leathery, glossy, dark green leaves (3-4” long) with finely serrated margins.  It is native to China and Japan.  It is winter hardy to and often grown outdoors year round in the southeastern U.S. plus Pacific coast areas.  It is the most commonly grown camellia species comprising thousands of cultivated varieties.  It is the state flower of Alabama.  The majority of the camellias grown at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis are grown indoors at the Linnean House.  Flower buds begin to form in mid-summer.  Buds appear in clusters.  Removing all but one bud per cluster will increase flower size.  Flowers (3-5” wide) bloom in mid-late winter (December to March) when grown outdoors in warm winter climates or in greenhouses, but bloom in early spring (April) when grown outdoors in the northern part of its growing range.  Species plants have single flowers, but cultivars with semidouble, anemone, peony, rose-form double, or formal double flower forms are available.  Each single flower has 5-8 petals.  Flower colors are most commonly white, pink or red with yellow anthers.  Flowers are borne at the tips of shoots or from lower leaf axils.  Rounded fruits (1 1/2” long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet is in reference to native territory of this species.
","
Problems
Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, black mold, flower blight, canker and root rot.  Scale can be a troublesome insect pest.  Aphids, thrips, mealybugs and mites may appear.  Yellow leaves may mean too little acidity in the soil.  Some flower bud dropping may be natural, but sometimes may be caused by overwatering or underwatering.  Limit pruning to removal of dead or damaged wood, unproductive branches, and disproportionately long shoots.  Shearing spoils the naturally attractive shape of the camellia.  Prune immediately after flowering or in early summer to stimulate branching.  Pruning later in the year can remove flower buds.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent flowering shrub for lawns, shrub borders, backgrounds, informal hedges and around homes in mild winter locations.  When grown outside their specified hardiness range, camellias are used primarily as conservatory plants, and they perform quite well in this environment.  Since they react badly to change (e.g., drop their buds), it is usually not recommended that they be moved outside in the summer months and then returned inside in the fall.  If possible, camellias should be grown in a brightly lit space that can accommodate their large spreading habit and be kept cool in the fall and winter to induce flowering.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where this evergreen shrub is typically grown in organically rich, acidic, well-drained soils with consistent moisture in part shade locations. Established plants do well with moderate but even moisture. Plants appreciate protection from early morning sun and from direct hot afternoon sun. They often thrive in sun-dappled part shade conditions under the protection of tree canopies. Protection from strong winds is also important. Apply a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark). Prune after flowering to thin branching and to control size and shape. Most camellias are purchased in pots. When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to not plant them too deep (soil level of the ground should be the same as the soil level in the pot). Plants may be effectively grown in tubs or other large containers. This camellia is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a). It may be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors in a cool greenhouse where necessary growing conditions (including bright light and cool winter temperatures of 45-60 degrees F) can be met.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camellia reticulata is native to Yunnan Province in China where it has been cultivated since at least 900 A.D. Today, over 100 named cultivars or varieties of C. reticulata are known to have originated in Yunnan. This camellia typically grows as a shrub to 8-10' tall, but in the wild in its native habitat it may grow as a small tree to 20' tall. Serrate, dark green leaves (to 4"" long) are evergreen. Flowers bloom from early to mid-season.Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet means netted, with a net-like pattern.'Dataohong' (sold in the U. S. under its translated name of CRIMSON ROBE) is one of eighteen C. reticulata cultivars that were first introduced to the West in 1948-1949 in a shipment of plants from the Yunnan Botanical Institute in Kunming to two California researchers. CRIMSON ROSE features large, semi-double, carmine red flowers (to 7"" across) with crinkled, wavy petals.
","
Problems
Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, anthracnose, viruses, black mold, petal blight, canker and root rot. If petal blight occurs (browning that runs from edges to the center), all infected plant parts should be promptly removed. Yellow leaves with green veins may indicate chlorosis which can be treated by adding iron/iron chelates to the soil. Scale can be a troublesome insect pest. Watch for aphids, planthoppers and spider mites.

Application of a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark) is advisable.  Prune as needed to control size and shape after flowering.  

This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a), but will usually survive winters therein in years where temperatures do not dip below zero degrees F.  In the alternative, this plant may be grown in tubs or containers that are overwintered indoors in a greenhouse or in the bright cool conditions of a sunroom with slightly reduced watering.  

Most sasanqua camellias are commercially sold in pots or tubs.  When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to plant them with the soil level in the container even with the soil level of the ground.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camellia sasanqua, commonly known as sasanqua camellia, is a densely branched, pyramidal to oval-rounded, tree-like, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-10’ tall.  It is native to Japan.  It is ornamentally noted for its attractive dark green foliage and fall to early winter flowers.  Lustrous, narrow-oval to obovate, dark green leaves (to 3” long) are cuneate and hairy on the midrib with rounded marginal teeth and pubescent petioles.  Stems (reddish when young) are covered with significant pubescence.  White to pale pink, 6-8 petaled, mildly aromatic flowers (2-3” diameter), each having a central mass of bright yellow-anthered stamens, bloom late summer to early winter depending on local climate.  Petals fall after several days but stamens remain, with additional flowers continuing to open in succession over a period of 4-6 weeks.  Flowers are followed by small rounded fruits.  Species flowers are single, but cultivar flowers often come in single, semi-double or double-flowered forms, with flower colors ranging primarily from white to red.  Fruit is a smooth and shiny capsule (to 3/4"" long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet comes from the Japanese name sasankua for a popular native species of Camellia.

Problems
Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, anthracnose, viruses, black mold, petal blight, canker and root rot.  If petal blight occurs (browning that runs from edges to the center), all infected plant parts should be promptly removed.  Yellow leaves with green veins may indicate chlorosis which can be treated by adding  iron chelates to the soil.  Scale can be a troublesome insect pest.  Watch for aphids, planthoppers and spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
Varies in form from upright and densely bushy to spreading and sometimes vinelike.  Woodland gardens.  Mixed borders.  Lawns accents.  Around homes.  Hedges.  Screens.  Espaliers.  Ground cover.  Bonsai.  

Container plants can be overwintered indoors in greenhouses or cool but bright sunrooms.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this evergreen shrub is typically grown in organically rich, acidic, well-drained soils with consistent moisture in part shade locations. Established plants do well with moderate but even moisture. Plants appreciate protection from early morning sun and from direct hot afternoon sun. They often thrive in sun-dappled part shade conditions under the protection of tree canopies. Protection from strong winds is also important. Apply a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark). Prune after flowering to thin branching and to control size and shape. Most camellias are purchased in pots. When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to not plant them too deep (soil level in the ground should be the same as the soil level in the pot). This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a). However, with protection and mild winter weather (temperatures that do not dip below zero degrees F), this camellia may survive winters outdoors in St. Louis. If attempted in St. Louis, this shrub should be grown in a sheltered and protected microclimate such as shaded areas near the south side of a home or building. Plants may be effectively grown in tubs or other large containers. Where not winter hardy, containers may be overwintered in a cool greenhouse where necessary growing conditions (including bright light and cool winter temperatures of 45-60 degrees F) can be met.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Processed leaves from Camellia sinensis and its many cultivars yield the tea leaves of commerce. Most commercial cultivation occurs in Asia (China to Burma and Sri Lanka). This camellia is also grown ornamentally for its excellent foliage and small but attractive fall flowers. It is probably native to China. It typically grows to 10-15' tall, but can easily be trimmed shorter (e.g., to 4-6' tall) or shaped as a hedge. Leathery, serrate, elliptic, glossy dark green leaves (to 5"" long) are evergreen. Fragrant white flowers (to 1 1/2"" across) with yellow stamens bloom in fall to early winter. Flowers are sometimes partially hidden by plant foliage. Fruit is a smooth and shiny capsule (to 3/4"" long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet means Chinese.

Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this flowering evergreen camellia makes an excellent addition to shady areas of the landscape such as woodland gardens, shrub borders, backgrounds, lawns and around homes. It may be grown as a specimen or in small groups, or it may be trimmed as a hedge. In St. Louis, experimental plantings must be sited in well-protected locations around houses, foundations and patios or in containers that can be overwintered in greenhouses. Excellent foliage and flowers can be fully appreciated without regard to the potential use of the leaves for tea.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Plants prefer cool summer climates.  Plants are generally intolerant of the extreme heat of the deep South, and do not perform well south of USDA Zone 6.  Appreciates some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Best in sandy loams.  Established plants are tolerant of periods of drought.  Plants perform best with regular and even moisture.  Deadhead spent flowers to encourage additional bloom.  Propagate by seed, cuttings or division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Campanula bononiensis, commonly called European bellflower, is an upright perennial that is native from Europe to central Asia.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in a few locations in the State of Maine.  Outward-drooping, bell-shaped, campanulate, lilac to light purple flowers (corolla to 3/4” long) in loose terminal spikes bloom July to September atop 2-3' tall stems rising from a rosette of petiolate, cordate-ovate, gray-green leaves.  Sessile, serrate-margined, ovate to lanceolate stem leaves (to 3” long near the base of the stem) decrease in size going up the stem.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet means of Bologna (formerly Bononia), Italy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Slugs and snails are occasional visitors.  Watch for aphids.
","
Garden Uses
Borders.  Cottage gardens.  Also effective in lightly shaded woodland areas where plants can be left alone to naturalize.  Best planted in groups or massed.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers part shade in hot summer climates. Performs best with regular moisture. Does not do well in climates where nighttime temperatures consistently remain above 70 degrees F. Benefits from a summer mulch which helps keep root zone cool. Deadheading spent blooms, though tedious, may extend bloom period. Cut plants back to basal growth if foliage depreciates in summer. Clumps need frequent division (every 2 years) to remain vigorous. Divide in spring or late summer. Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Campanula carpatica, commonly called Carpathian bellflower or Carpathian harebell, is a tufted perennial which typically forms low-growing clumps of basal foliage which slowly spread to form an attractive ground cover.  Campanulate, upward-facing, cup-shaped blue flowers (to 2"" across) appear singly atop thin axillary stalks rising above the foliage in a profuse late spring to early summer bloom. A sparser rebloom sometimes continues throughout the summer to early fall, especially in cool summer climates. Triangular to ovate light green leaves (to 1.5"" long). Foliage is semi-evergreen to evergreen in warm winter climates. Species is native to the Carpathian Mountains in Europe.

Forma alba has white flowers.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet means of the Carpathian Mountains.'White Clips' is a compact cultivar which grows to only 6-8"" tall and features white flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Snails and slugs are occasional visitors.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Campanula glomerata, commonly known as clustered bellflower, is an upright perennial that is native to Europe and temperate Asia.  It forms a dense foliage clump of ovate to lance-shaped, toothed, somewhat hairy, long-stalked, medium green basal leaves (to 5” long).   Upward facing, bell-shaped, violet to lavender blue flowers bloom in spherical terminal clusters atop smaller-leaved stems rising above the basal clump to 12-18” tall.  Smaller flower clusters simultaneously bloom in the upper leaf axils.  Stem leaves (to 3 1/2” long) are narrower and shorter than the basal leaves. Flowers bloom in late spring to early summer (perhaps into mid-summer if the spent flower stems are promptly removed after bloom).Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word glomeratus meaning clustered in reference to the densely packed inflorescences.Common name is also in reference to the densely packed inflorescences, each having a cluster of up to 15 flowers.

Needs regular moisture.  Promptly remove spent flower stems to encourage additional bloom and to prevent self-seeding.  Divide clumps in fall every 3-5 years to maintain vigor and/or control spread.  Originally introduced into North America as an ornamental, but this plant is now considered by many authorities to be an invasive, hard-to-eliminate weed that easily spreads, particularly in moist soils, by stolons/rhizomes.  Deep taproots are difficult to eradicate.  Herbicides do not always work.  Digging out the tubers can be effective, but it is difficult to remove all pieces of tubers and roots from a given area.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Campanula rapunculoides, commonly known as creeping bellflower, rover bellflower or European bellflower, is a deeply-taprooted, rhizomatous perennial that is native to a variety of habitats in Europe and western Asia including open woodlands, forest margins and meadows.  It was long ago introduced into North America where it subsequently escaped gardens and naturalized over time in Alaska, Canada, and across the northern U. S. from Washington to Maine south to Nevada, Texas, Tennessee and North Carolina.  

Nodding, bell-shaped, campanulate, 5-lobed, bluish-purple flowers (each to 1” long) with flaring petals bloom abundantly in usually one-sided terminal racemes atop slender, upright, leafy flowering stems rising well above the basal foliage clump to 2-4’ tall.   Flowers bloom June to August.  Toothed foliage features long-stalked, ovate basal leaves (to 3” long) with cordate bases and narrower, short-stalked to stalkless, lanceolate-ovate stem leaves (to 4” long).  

This invasive plant is not recommended for planting in garden areas.  Unfortuntately, it is sometimes mistakenly sold by nurseries under the name of Adenophora liliifolia, commonly known as ladybells, which is very similar in physical appearance but lacking in invasive characteristics.     

Leaves, shoots and roots are edible for humans.  This plant was once grown as a food plant.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet means like Rapunculus is in reference to an obsolete name for bellflowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Campanula rotundifolia, commonly called bluebell or harebell, is a rosette-forming, upright perennial that typically grows to 20"" tall. It is noted for producing attractive, bell-shaped, nodding blue flowers (each to 1/2"" long) that bloom singly or in small clusters from the stem tips throughout summer (June-September). This bluebell is native to a variety of different environments including meadows, grasslands, rocky slopes, crevices, alpine areas and sandy shores in the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. From a basal rosette of small, rounded, long-stalked, basal leaves (to 1"" wide) rise wiry, thread-like stems clad with narrow, alternate, linear leaves (each to 1-3"" long). Basal leaves usually wither early and disappear before the flowers form. This plant is also native to a small area in the Ozarks in Shannon County where it is found on north-facing limestone bluffs along the Jack's Fork River.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet is in reference to the rounded basal leaves.This bluebell has a large number of common names. Harebell may relate to the fact that this plant is sometimes found in areas inhabited by rabbits (hares). This same plant grows in Scotland where it is popularly known as the bluebells of Scotland or Scotch bluebell.

Culture
Easily grown in a wide variety of soils. Best planted in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun to part shade. Foliage grows well in shade, but plants need good sun for best flowering. It blooms on new growth, so early spring pruning will not affect the flowering. Vines must be grown on sturdy structures because mature plants produce considerable weight. The problem with species plants (Campsis radicans) is usually not how to grow them but how to restrain them, in large part because they sucker profusely from underground runners and freely self-seed, often forming impenetrable colonies in the wild which can choke out many plants that get in their way.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Campsis radicans, commonly called trumpet vine or trumpet creeper, is a dense, vigorous, multi-stemmed, deciduous, woody, clinging vine that attaches itself to structures and climbs by aerial rootlets.  It is native to the southeastern U. S. including Missouri, but has naturalized in many northern states.  In Missouri, trumpet vine is native to the Ozark region, but has naturalized throughout the State where it now typically occurs in woods, thickets, fields and along streams, roadsides and railroad tracks (Steyermark).  Species plants rapidly grow to 30-40' high.  Compound, odd-pinnate leaves (to 15” long) are shiny dark green above and glabrous dull green below.  Each leaf has 7 to 11 elliptic to oblong leaflets (to 4"" long) with serrated margins.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Clusters (terminal cymes) of red trumpet-shaped flowers (to 3” long) appear throughout the summer (June to September).  Flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds.  Flowers are followed by long, bean-like seed pods (3-5” long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous 2-winged seeds for dispersal by the wind. Trumpet vine is also commonly known as cow-itch vine because some people experience skin redness and itching after coming in contact with the leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek word kampe meaning bent in reference to the bent stamens on plant flowers.Specific epithet means having rooting stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Species is a very aggressive spreader.
","
Garden Uses
Woodland gardens, naturalized areas. Provides quick cover for fences, arbors, trellises, walls or other structures in the landscape. Also may be grown along the ground to camouflage rock piles or old tree stumps. Good vine for hot, dry sites. Needs lots of room. Excellent for hummingbird gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in lean, well-drained, dry to medium moisture soils in full sun.  Thrives in areas with poor, dry, rocky or sandy soils in hot sun.  Intolerant of shade.  Established plants require little watering.  Avoid overwatering.  Plants will not survive winter when temperatures dip below 18 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Capparis spinosa, commonly called caper bush, is a scrambling, sprawling, spiny, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 3’ tall, but spreads by semi-prostrate branching to as much as 6-10’ wide.  It is native to somewhat hostile growing conditions including sandy or gravelly soils, rocky hillsides, cliffs, stone walls and rock crevices in Mediterranean coastal regions (southern Europe, Middle East and northern Africa) and from southwestern Asia to the Black Sea extending eastward to the Himalayas, Pacific Islands and northern Australia.  The unopened flower buds of this shrub are picked and preserved in salt or pickled in vinegar as the culinary capers which are now enjoyed world-wide as garnishes or as pungent flavor additives to a large number of foods including sauces, butters, salads, fish, meats, pizza toppings and hors d’oeuvres.  Capers commercially harvested for human consumption come primarily from plants growing in southern Spain, France, Italy and Algeria.  Culinary use of capers extends back in history at least 2500 years.  

Attractive white-petaled flowers (2-3” across) with pale purple stamens bloom on long pedicils rising from the leaf axils.  Flowers only last one day, but bloom profusely from May to early autumn.  The unopened buds of these flowers are the capers.  Flower buds are picked prior to opening when still tight, washed in salt water to remove grit, dried, and finally salted down or pickled in vinegar.  Buds are often picked daily because the youngest buds have the best quality.  Unpicked buds open to flowers which are followed by oblong, multi-seeded, edible fruits known as caperberries.  Caperberries and young shoots with leaves may also be picked and pickled.  Small, round to ovate, dark green, semi-succulent leaves (to 2” long) are evergreen.  Leaf stipules on species plants develop a pair of sharp hooked spines at the base of each leaf petiole.  Hands are easily scratched when harvesting capers and clothing may catch on the hooked spines when brushing up against a shrub.The genus name Capparis comes from kapparis which is the ancient Greek name for the caper bush.Specific epithet is in reference to the stipular spines.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in moist, organically rich, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Pinch young plants to promote bushiness. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date. Set seedlings or purchased plants out in the garden after last frost date.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Although grown in vegetable gardens for many years, peppers are becoming increasingly popular as ornamentals. Plants of this species are quite varied but generally grow in shrubby mounds to 1-4’ tall and feature star to bell-shaped white or yellow flowers and lance-shaped to oval medium green leaves. Flowers give way to edible peppers, ranging from extremely hot chili peppers to sweet bell peppers. Many cultivars have been developed with a view toward ornamental use, featuring attractive peppers in bright shades of red, yellow, purple, orange and brown. This species has been organized into five botanical groups: Cerasiforme group (cherry peppers), Conioides group (cone peppers), Fasciculatum group (red cone peppers), Grossum group (sweet bell peppers) and Longum group (chili peppers and cayenne peppers).Genus name comes from the Greek word kapto meaning to bite.Specific epithet means annual.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Fungal and bacterial leaf spot, wilt, mosaic virus and stem/root rot may occur. Potential insect pests include aphids, white flies, cutworms, pepper maggots and Colorado potato beetles.
","
Garden Uses
Bedding, edging, containers, window boxes and houseplants.

Culture
Peppers demand warm weather and don’t like their roots disturbed. Plant seeds in a sunny warm location in peat pots (3 seeds to a pot, thinning to 1 plant per pot) 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting into the garden after all danger of frost is past and night temperatures are consistently at or above 55 degrees F. Plant in full sun in fertile well-drained soil, 18 to 24"" apart in rows 18 to 24"" apart. Do not permit seedlings or plants to suffer from low temperature or drought. Mulching between plants is useful. Avoid planting where peppers, tomatoes, or eggplants grew previously. All three are members of the nightshade family and are subject to similar diseases. After one or more plantings of any of these three in a particular location, carryover pathogens in the soil can infect new plants. Peppers do well as container plants, and can be maintained over longer periods with indoor wintering, providing a sufficiently sunny location is available.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Most peppers, also known as chili peppers, can be categorized as one of three general types: sweet peppers, hot peppers or ornamental peppers. However, these categories are general at best. Some hot peppers aren’t hot, all peppers can be highly ornamental, many ornamental peppers are hot, etc. -- and none of these categories necessarily mirror botanical nomenclature distinctions. 

Peppers were one of the earliest plants cultivated in the New World. Archeological evidence suggests that peppers were used as food ingredients in Peru more than 8,000 years ago. Columbus mistakenly applied the label ‘pepper’ to the plant he found growing in Caribbean gardens, likely confusing it with the highly prized but botanically unrelated black pepper. Within 100 years, peppers had spread around the world and today constitute the defining ingredient in traditional cuisines worldwide, including countries such as Italy, Thailand, Hungary, India, Spain, China and Holland. 

Botanically, most cultivated peppers today are Capsicum annum (most common), C. frutescens (tabasco), C. chinense(habanero), or crosses within and among these various species.Genus name comes from the Greek word kapto meaning to bite.Specific epithet means Chinese.
","
Problems
Potential pests include aphids, white flies, cutworms, pepper maggots, and Colorado potato beetles. Diseases include Verticillium wilt and mosaic virus.
","
Garden Uses
All peppers can be highly ornamental, with deep green leaves and fruit of a wide variety of shapes, sizes and colors. Colors may includeg green, red, yellow, chocolate, orange, lilac, purple, ivory and mahogany. As fruits gradually ripen, several colors can be found on a plant simultaneously.

Culture
Best grown in humusy, organically-rich, well-drained soils in part shade. In optimum growing conditions, plants will slowly naturalize by rhizomes to form colonies. Difficult to grow from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cardamine concatenata, commonly called toothwort or cut-leaved toothwort, is a Missouri native spring wildflower which occurs in rich woods and wooded slopes throughout the State and typically grows 8-15"" tall. This is a spring ephemeral which blooms in early spring before the leaves emerge on deciduous trees and goes dormant by late spring to early summer. Stems rise directly from rhizomes. Each stem has a whorl of three leaves near the middle of the stem, with each leaf divided into three, narrow, sharply-toothed, lance-shaped segments. A terminal cluster of four-petaled, white flowers (sometimes with a pink blush) blooms at the top of each stem. Flower petals are arranged in the shape of a cross. Synonymous with and sometimes still sold by nurseries as Dentaria lancinata. Although the leaves are toothed, the common name probably is in reference to the tooth-like projections on the fleshy rootstock. The toothworts are sometimes called pepperroots in reference to the spicy, radish-like flavor of the rhizomes which can be cut up and added to salads.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a plant of the cress family.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage disappears from the garden in early summer as plants go dormant.
","
Garden Uses
Best in woodland gardens, wild flower gardens or naturalized areas. Can be grown in shaded areas of borders or rock gardens as long as sited near later-developing perennials which will fill the gaps left by late spring dormancy.

Culture
Best grown in rich, humusy, moist to wet, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Plants thrive in cool summer climates in part shade locations.  In optimum growing conditions, plants will slowly naturalize by short rhizomes to form colonies, but plants are not considered to be invasive.  Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3 or 4 to 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cardamine pratensis, commonly called bitter cress or meadow cress, is an herbaceous perennial that grows in a loose clump to 12-16"" tall.  It has a circumpolar distribution, covering parts of Europe, Asia and North America.  In North America, it is typically found in moist to wet areas of woods, swamps, fields, meadows, grasslands and ditches throughout Canada south to Minnesota, Illinois and Virginia.  Compound-pinnate basal leaves (each to 6"" long) have up to 8 pairs of tiny oval rounded leaflets.  The much smaller compound-pinnate stem leaves have narrower almost linear leaflets.  Upright, unbranched stems rise from the basal rosette to 12-16"" tall in spring.  Each stem is topped by a terminal cluster (short open raceme) of small 4-petalled pale pink to white flowers.  This spring bloom (April to June) arguably occurs at the same time as when the cuckoo begins to coo (another common name for this plant is cuckoo flower).  Flowers are followed by pods which explode when ripe (July) to distribute seed.  Young leaves and shoots are edible (may be added to salads), but with a pungent and bitter flavor that is somewhat reminiscent of water cress.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a plant of the cress family.Specific epithet means of the meadows.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Powdery mildew, downy mildew and rust are potential disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best in woodland gardens, bog gardens, wild flower gardens, cottage gardens or informal naturalized areas.  Can be grown in shaded areas of borders or rock gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture soils in part shade to full shade. Will grow in full sun. This species tolerates dry soil conditions better than most species of Carex. Plants will slowly spread by rhizomes and will self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex albicans, sometimes commonly called white tinged sedge or oak sedge, is a rhizomatous perennial sedge (section Acrocystis) that grows in a clump to 15-20"" tall. It is native to North America from Quebec and Ontario south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it is found throughout the State, but most frequently in messic to dry upland forests and shaded ledges and less frequently in sandy bottomland forests (Steyermark). Narrow, grass-like, upright-arching, bright green leaf blades (to 16"" long and 1/10"" wide) grow in either dense tufts or loose colonies of tufts. Flowers bloom in late spring (May) on flowering stems rising to as much as 20"" tall. Inflorescence has a staminate terminal spike and pistillate lateral spikes. Staminate scales are green to straw-colored, often tinged with reddish purple and white-margined. Pistillate scales are usually dark brown to black with green midribs and white margins. Fruits are trigonous, one-seeded achenes enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia). Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world. Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning whitish.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in groups or massed for foliage effect. Effective as a ground cover. Good selection for shade/part shade gardens and landscape areas. Good year round foliage interest.

Culture
Easily grown in moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates shady conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex annectens is a sedge (sometimes commonly called yellowfruit sedge) that grows in dense tussocks (clumps) to 1-3' tall and to 2' wide. It is native to eastern North America. In Missouri, it is found throughout the State in bottomland prairies, pond/lake margins, sinkhole ponds, fens, marshes, fields, roadside ditches, depressions and moist disturbed ground (Steyermark). It is occasionally found as an emergent aquatic. Narrow, glaucous, grass-like leaves (to 24"" long) grow in dense clumps. Flowers appear in late spring in green/yellow/brown spikes atop stems rising above the foliage.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in mass or groups for foliage effect in moist to wet areas. Good selection for low spots, stream/pond margins or areas with seasonal flooding. Also may be grown in a variety of upland locations as long as soils are kept consistently moist. Effective accent for smaller gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in evenly moist to wet soil conditions with some organic matter.  Will tolerate periods of shallow, standing water. This woodland species prefers part sun, but can be grown with more sun exposure if soils stay moist. Although it prefers moist conditions, there is some question as to whether this plant will tolerate clay soils. Hardy in Zones 4-8.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex bromoides, commonly called brome-like sedge, is a tussock-forming perennial sedge found mostly in the Northeast, northern Mid-Atlantic, and the Great Lakes Region.  It can also be found less frequently throughout the rest of the eastern half of the United States, including several counties in southeastern Missouri. This sedge grows in moist habitats, including soggy woodlands, wetland margins, and vernal ponds.  Its bright green, narrow, linear leaves reach 9"" long and only 1/10"" wide. This sedge does not spread by runners, and instead forms single clumps which expand slowly in size. Mature clumps take on a gently arching habit, and can grow to 12"" in height with a 20"" spread. Flowering stems (10-30"" tall) appear in late spring to summer (May-July) and are topped with a inflorescence made up of 3-8 spikelets which contain both male and female flowers. The inflorecences mature from light green to tan over the course of the growing season. Like other wetland Carex species, brome-like sedge is a host plant for a number of native butterflies and moths, including the eyed brown (Satyrodes eurydice) and several species of skipper. The seeds are attractive to birds.

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world. Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet bromoides refers to the similarities in grass-like texture of this species to one or more species in the genus Bromus.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems reported.
","
Garden Uses
Use in a semi-shady portion of a rain garden, low-lying woodland area, along a stream/pond margin, or other consistently moist area in the garden. Can be used as a fine-textured specimen plant, or massed to create a non-aggressive ground cover.

Culture
Easily grown in medium to moist soils in full sun to part shade. Best performance occurs in soils with consistent moisture. Plants lack developed rhizomes, but will self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex bushii, sometimes commonly called Bush's sedge, is a perennial sedge (section Porocystis) that grows in a loose clump to 1-3' tall. It is native to meadows, fields, open woods, dry to mesic grasslands, prairies and stream/pond margins in the eastern and central U.S. (Massachusetts to Wisconsin to Nebraska south to Texas and Georgia). In Missouri, it is found throughout the State except in the far northwestern and southeastern corners. In addition to traditional native sites, this sedge is also sometimes found in ditches, railroad right-of-ways, roadsides, old fields, pastures and disturbed open ground (Steyermark). Plants feature pubescent, narrow, grass-like, mostly-basal, medium green leaves (to 12"" long and 1/2"" wide). Flowers bloom in late spring (May) in spikes (pistillate scales are reddish-brown) on rough, sparsely-hairy, triangular stems rising above the foliage to 2-3' tall. Flowers are unisexual and appear on the same spike, with the pistillate female flowers located just above the staminate male flowers. Flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia). Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world. Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet honors botanist Benjamin Franklin Bush (1858-1937).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in mass for foliage effect in consistently moist soils. Flowers are not particularly showy. Good selection for low spots or stream/pond margins. Also may be grown in a variety of upland locations as long as soils are kept consistently moist. Effective accent for smaller gardens.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex cherokeensis, commonly called Cherokee sedge, is native to the southeastern and southcentral United States. In Missouri, it has only been found in lowland areas in Butler County (Steyermark). This sedge forms attractive, slowly-spreading clumps (6-12” tall) of fine-textured, narrow, grass-like, deep green leaves. It is grown in the landscape for its foliage effect. Greenish-white flowers in spring are insignificant. Wheat-like seed spikes mature in autumn.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Easily grown in moist to wet soils including standing water in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in wet low spots, water margins and areas that experience some seasonal flooding, but also tolerates drier soils with medium moisture.  Tolerates shady conditions.  Spreads by rhizomes to form large colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex crinita, commonly called fringed sedge, is an evergreen sedge with short creeping rhizomes.  It grows in dense tussocks (clumps) of leafy culms (vegetative and flowering stems) rising to 2-3' tall (without flowers) and to 1-2' wide.  Each culm typically has strap-like medium green leaves (each to 16"" long and 1/2"" wide) which are rough along the margins.  Flowers bloom in late spring (May-June) in terminal inflorescences atop upright to ascending flowering culms which typically arch above the foliage to as much as 4' tall.  Each inflorescence consists of drooping flowers in 1-2 staminate spikelets (each to 2"" long) and 2-6 pistillate spikelets (each to 4"" long).  Female flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).  This is an emergent aquatic that is native primarily to wet meadows, wet prairies, swamps, sloughs, marshes, bogs and water margins in eastern and central North America (Nova Scotia to Manitoba south to Georgia and Texas).  In Missouri, it is scattered throughout the State (most frequently found in the Ozarks) in bottomland prairies, moist depressions in upland prairies, and margins of streams, ponds, lakes, sloughs, marshes and fens (Steyermark).  

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means with long, weak hairs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in mass for foliage effect in moist to wet areas including ones with some standing water.  Flowers are not showy.  Good selection for low spots, stream/pond margins or areas with seasonal flooding.  Also may be grown in a variety of  upland locations including areas with medium moisture soils.  Effective accent.  Good for erosion control.  Rain gardens.   Will naturalize over time to form colonies.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex cristatella, commonly called crested oval sedge, is a perennial sedge that typically grows in a clump to 1-3' tall on upright triangular culms.  Glabrous, grass-like, light green leaves (to 16"" long and 1/3"" wide) appear in basal clumps and along the culms.  This sedge is native to bottomland prairies, moist depressions of upland prairies, moist woodlands, boggy marshes, wet meadows, sloughs, pond margins and stream banks from Quebec to Saskatchewan south to North Dakota, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina (Steyermark).  Flowers bloom in late spring (May-June) in terminal inflorescences atop flowering culms which typically rise above the foliage to as much as 3' tall.  Each inflorescence consists of a short stalk of globose, densely packed, prickly (perigynia beaks) spikelets (each to 1/3"" across), with each spikelet containing pistillate flowers only or in some cases primarily pistillate flowers with a small area of staminate flowers located at the base of the spikelet.  Pistillate flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).

Culture
Grow in medium moisture soils in part shade to full shade. Thrives in soils that receive consistent moisture, but also will grow in drier sandy or rocky soils. Cut foliage to the ground and remove in late winter. Plants spread slowly by rhizomes over time, sometimes forming large colonies in optimum conditions in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex eburnea, sometimes commonly called bristle-leaf sedge, is native from Newfoundland to Alaska south to Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas. In Missouri, it most commonly occurs in crevices of limestone bluffs in the Ozark areas of the state (Steyermark). It is also known to grow in drier sandy soils, particularly on limestone outcroppings and glades. This sedge is grown in the landscape for its foliage effect. Soft, thread-like, green leaves form a spherical, porcupine-like clump to 6-10” tall and as wide. Whitish-green flowers on spikes in spring are insignificant. Other common names for this sedge include ivory sedge and ebony sedge.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means ivory-white.

Culture
Easily grown in medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade.  Thrives in moist soils, including standing water to 1-2” deep, but established plants also perform well in average garden soils with some moderate tolerance for drought.  Will grow in full sun in cool summer climates.  Evergreen in warm winter climates, but foliage should be cut to the ground and removed in late winter in cold winter climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex flacca, commonly called blue-green sedge, is a dense, cool-season, clump-forming but slowly creeping, grass-like, rhizomatous, evergreen sedge which typically grows to 6-10” tall and features narrow, arching, somewhat coarse leaves (3/16” wide) which are blue-green above but blue-gray beneath.  It is native to areas around the Mediterranean where it typically grows in calcareous grasslands, marshes, sand dunes, and estuaries in southern Europe and North Africa.  It is primarily grown in landscapes as a ground cover for its foliage effect.  Insignificant flowers appear in early summer on terminal, cylindrical spikes to 12” tall.  Plants spread somewhat slowly, but will form colonies after several years and can be used as an effective ground cover.  Tolerates very light foot traffic.   

Carex flacca was first described by German botanist Johan Christian Daniel von Schreber (1739-1810) in 1771.  One year later, the same plant was described by Giovanni Scopoli (1723-1788), Italian physician and naturalist, as Carex glauca.  Carex glauca is now generally recognized to be simply a synonym of Carex flacca.  Under the “first in time” rule, Carex flacca is the accepted botanical name for this species.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means weak or soft.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or group in woodland gardens, shade gardens, borders or rock gardens.  Effective accent for smaller gardens.  Ground cover for shade gardens.  Edging plant for paths or walkways.  Also appropriate for areas with moist soils such as low spots, stream/pond margins or bog gardens.  Grows in standing water to 2” deep in water gardens.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex flaccosperma, sometimes commonly called blue wood sedge, is native to eastern North America. In Missouri, Carex flaccosperma var. flaccosperma is typically found in wet woodland or swampy ground in the lowland section of southeastern Missouri, and Carex flaccosperma var. glaucodea is more typically found in drier acidic soils of wooded slopes, upland ridges, ravines or wooded valleys along streams (Steyermark). This is an evergreen sedge that forms attractive clumps (6-10” tall) of fine-textured, narrow, grass-like, glaucous, blue-green leaves (to 3/8” wide). It is grown in the landscape for its foliage effect. Greenish-white flowers in spring are insignificant.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.

Culture
Gray sedge grows best in moist fertile soil in full sun, but will tolerate light shade. It thrives at or near water. Propagation is through seeding in the fall and division in the spring. Under suitable conditions, this sedge may self-seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex grayi, commonly called gray sedge, has greenish yellow to brown seed heads that look like spiked clubs and are attractive in both fresh and dried flower arrangements. The fruits remain on the plant in winter, adding an interesting accent when the shadows reflect on snow. The grass-like leaves, which are up to 1/2"" wide, are semi-evergreen.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet honors Asa Gray (1810-1888), a leading American botanist and author of such great works as the notable Gray's Manual of Botany (1848; 8th edition 1950).
","
Problems
There are no known pests. Gray sedge does not do well in dry soil and in hot climates may not reach full height.
","
Garden Uses
Gray sedge is best when used in large groups around pools and ponds. It also makes an interesting accent plant when grown near water gardens or even in containers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex haydenii is a Missouri native sedge which occurs mostly in moist locations along streams, wet meadows and river bottom prairies in scattered locations in the northwest and west central areas of the State. It is a loose, clump-forming sedge with fine-textured, narrow, grass-like green leaves. Flowers spikes appear in May on stems (culms) typically rising 12-18"" tall. Upper flower spikes are staminate and narrow, with the terminal one being the longest (to 1""). Lower flower spikes are pistillate or androgynous and shorter and oblong. Flowers are insignificant, but the seed heads which follow are attractive on close inspection. Flowering stems, as with many of the sedges, are triangular, thus giving rise to the jingle: grasses are round, but sedges have edges.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
A native sedge for wet, shady areas. Mass or group in woodland gardens, shade gardens, native plant gardens or rock gardens. Edging plant for paths or walkways. Also appropriate for low spots and stream/pond margins.

Culture
Easily grown in medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade.  Likes moist, shady areas.  Soils should not be allowed to dry out and need consistent supplemental watering in hot summer weather.  Cut foliage to the ground and remove in late winter.  May be propagated by division or seed.  In optimum growing conditions, plants will slowly naturalize over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex laxiculmis, sometimes commonly called creeping sedge, is an evergreen sedge that is native to rich wooded areas in eastern North America.  In Missouri it is uncommonly found in mesic upland forests in the southern part of the State (Steyermark).  It typically grows in a dense rounded clump to 12” tall with grassy blue-green leaves to 12-14” long and 1/2” wide.  Non-showy, yellowish-white flowers bloom in May-June atop triangular flowering stems.

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Group or mass as a clumping ground cover in shady areas of borders or woodland gardens.  Edging plant for paths or woodland areas.  Also appropriate for areas with moist soils such as low spots or on the periphery of streams or ponds.

Culture
Grows best in wet to moist soil in full sun to partial shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex lurida  is common throughout southern and central Missouri in the moist soil beside ponds, streams and spring branches and in calcium-rich swampy meadows. Its grass-like leaves grow up to 3' tall from short stout rhizomes. The seedheads resemble small sweetgum balls but do not grow above the foliage. This sedge is less prone to summer dieback and remains attractive during warm weather.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means smoky yellow, sallow or wan.
","
Problems
Although this sedge does not go dormant in summer, it may require supplemental watering if planted in dry areas.
","
Garden Uses
Best for locations with moist soil such as around water gardens or in establishing native plants in wet meadows, swampy areas, or around bodies of water.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade.  Soils should not be allowed to dry out.  Foliage color is sharper and richer in shady conditions.  Foliage may bleach to unattractive shades of yellow when these plants are grown in full sun.  This sedge is evergreen in the deep South (USDA Zones 8-9), but is not evergreen near the northern edge of its growing range (e.g., the St. Louis area), although some foliage color may persist through mild winters.  Where not evergreen, foliage should be cut to the ground and removed in late winter.  Propagate by plant division in spring or seeding in the fall.   

This sedge may be grown as a container plant using a mixture of one-half peat moss and one-half fertile soil which needs to be kept constantly moist but well-drained.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex morrowii, commonly known as Japanese sedge or Morrow’s sedge, is a sedge that typically grows in a dense, grass-like clump to 1-2’ tall.  It is native to low alpine areas in Japan.  This sedge is typically grown for its attractive shape and foliage.  Plants feature stiff, flat, narrow, long-pointed, solid green leaves (1/2” wide to 12” long).  Brownish flowers (lack petals and sepals) are short-lived and inconspicuous.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet honors Dr. James Morrow who collected this plant in Japan as a member of the U. S. Expedition led by Commodore Perry in 1853-1854.Common name of sedge comes from the Latin word for sedge (secafre) meaning to cut in reference to the sharp leaf edges.  An old saying is worth repeating here:  “sedges have edges, and rushes are round but grasses have nodes from their tips to the ground.”Cultivars with variegated foliage are much more commonly sold in commerce, and are considered to have superior ornamental interest to straight species plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Group or mass as a ground cover in shade areas of borders or woodland gardens.  Grows well in the shade of trees.  Effective accent for smaller gardens.  Also appropriate for areas with moist soils such as low spots and stream/pond margins.  Most effective when grown in large clumps or massed plantings, although smaller clumps can be attractive in shady areas of rock gardens.  Good in containers.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun to part shade. This species does well in some shade, but tends to flop in too much shade. Best in constantly moist, fertile soil, but will grow in shallow water (3-4"" deep). Grows well away from water, but soil must not be allowed to dry out. Cut to ground in winter. Plants slowly naturalize by rhizomes in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex muskingumensis, commonly called palm sedge, is a dense, clump-forming sedge which is grown for its foliage effect. Produces rigid, erect stems to 20"" tall with 8"" long, pointed, grass-like, light green leaves radiating from the stem tops. Commonly called palm sedge since the leaves somewhat superficially resemble miniature palm fronds. A Missouri native which is found most often in wooded swamps and on wooded flood plains of rivers. Spread by rhizomes and self-seeding. Insignificant flowers appear in May on terminal spikes which are not showy but are noticeable and of some interest and persist throughout the summer. Foliage promptly turns yellow after frost.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Species is named for the Muskingum River in Ohio.
","
Problems

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex normalis, commonly called greater straw sedge or spreading oval sedge, is a perennial sedge (Section Ovales) that typically grows in a slowly creeping clump to 2-3' tall and as wide on upright triangular culms clad with narrow, linear, grass-like, green leaves (each to 2' long and to 1/4"" wide).   Green-veined leaf sheaths have distinctive white interveinal areas.  This sedge is native to open woods, thickets, bottomland prairies, ditches, stream/pond margins, meadows and roadsides from Quebec to Minnesota south to South Dakota, Arkansas and Georgia.  It is found throughout Missouri except in the western Ozarks (Steyermark).  Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.

Flowers bloom in late spring (May-June) in compound, multi-branched, terminal inflorescences (to 2"" long) atop flowering culms rising above the leaves to 3 1/2' tall.  Each inflorescence is a cluster of densely packed, tufted spikes (each to 1/2"" across). Pistillate flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means at right angles.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Prefers loose loams in dry soils in sun-dappled part shade.  Most sedges prefer moist to wet soils, but not this one.  Plants spread by rhizomes.  Plants may self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex pensylvanica, commonly called Pennsylvania sedge, is a shade-loving perennial sedge that is native to thickets and dry woodland areas in Eastern and Central North America from Quebec to Manitoba south to Mississippi and Georgia.  In Missouri, it is found mostly north of the Missouri River in dry to mesic upland forests and shaded bluff ledges (Steyermark).  It typically grows in loose colonies with a creeping habit.  Roots are reddish brown.  It is often found in areas with oak trees, hence the additional common name of oak sedge.  This is a low sedge with soft, delicate, arching, semi-evergreen leaves (each to 1/8""  wide).  It typically grows in a clump to 8"" tall.  It is semi-evergreen in moderately cold winter climates.  Narrow, grass-like, medium green leaves (to 8-12"" long) are typically shorter than the flowering stems.  Plants are monoecious (spikelets of male flowers above female flowers).  Flowers bloom in late spring (May) in inflorescences atop rough, sharply triangular culms (stems) which rise up singly from the rhizomes.  Staminate scales are green often tinged with reddish-purple with white margins.  Pistillate scales are dark brown to purplish black with green midribs and white margins.  Female flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).  

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means of Pennsylvania, USA.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Groundcover for dry shade.  Underplanting for shade perennials.  Lawn substitute for dry soils in shady areas (forms a turf  that never needs mowing or mow 2-3 times per year to 2"" tall).   May be best to use purchased plants for covering large areas because this species often does not grow well from seed.

Culture
Easily grown in average, moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. It will also grow in somewhat dry soils. It is very tolerant of salty/alkaline conditions. Plants spread by rhizomes, and may self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex praegracilis, sometimes commonly called clustered field sedge, is a perennial sedge with stout black rhizomes that grows in a loose clump to 2-3' tall. Plants feature narrow, grass-like, mostly-basal, medium green leaves (to 8-12"" long). Flowers bloom in late spring (May) in inflorescences (5-15 spikes each) atop rough, sharply triangular culms (stems) which rise up singly from the rhizomes to 2-3' tall. Plants may be monoecious (spikelets with male flowers above the female flowers) or dioecious (spikelets of male and female flowers on separate plants). Female flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia). This sedge is typically found growing in moist/wet to relatively dry sites on prairies, stream banks, lake margins, seeps, open woodlands, ditches, railroad track right-of-ways and roadsides from Alaska and southern Canada throughout the remaining continental U.S. except for the southeast and south central portions (North Carolina to Florida west to Texas). Original native range was primarily in the western U.S. and Great Plains, but this sedge has been introduced over time into various parts of the Midwest and Northeast, plus has spread into those areas, particularly along railroad tracks and highways. It has tolerance for saline conditions (including those caused by application of road salt in winter), hence the additional common name of expressway sedge. 

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout he world. Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Meadows, stream/pond peripheries, and foundations. Good plant for wet, boggy areas of the landscape. Good for erosion control. Experimental turf grass substitute in California.

Culture
Best grown in moist to moderately wet, organically rich loams in sun-dappled to medium shade.  Tolerates close to full shade.  Soils should never be allowed to dry out and need consistent supplemental watering in hot summer weather.  Cut foliage close to the ground and remove as needed in late winter.  Plants may be propagated by division or seed.  In optimum growing conditions, plants will naturalize by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex radiata, commonly known as eastern star sedge (star-like flower clusters) or straight-styled wood sedge (tip of the female flower known as the style is straight rather than curled), is an evergreen perennial that typically produces a dense foliage clump to 8-12” tall of narrow, grass-like, medium green blades.  This sedge is native to mesic to wet-mesic bottomlands and upland forests and on moist ravine slopes, sometimes in seasonally wet locations, in eastern North America from Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Georgia.  

Ascending to wide-spreading, triangular culms (flower stems) rise above the foliage clump in spring to 20-28” tall.  Most culms are topped by an open, elongate, yellowish-green, terminal inflorescence (to 1-3” long) consisting of 3-8 flower spikelets.  Each spikelet contains a star-like cluster of 3-9 perigynia (perigynum is a scale-like bract which encloses each female flower).  Flowers bloom from April-May.  Male flowers, if present, are borne above the female flowers on the spikes (androgynous).   Female flowers are followed by tiny, ovate to obovate achenes which radiate outward from the stem in a star-like pattern.  Short rhizomes are poorly-developed. 
 
Carex radiata is very similar to and was formerly included in C. rosea.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet from Latin means radiating in reference to the developing seeds radiating outward from the stem.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Group or mass as a clumping ground cover in shady areas of borders, woodland gardens or naturalized areas.  Edging plant for paths or woodland areas.  Also appropriate for areas with moist soils such as low spots or on the periphery of streams or ponds.

Culture
Carex squarrosa grows well in full sun to partial shade. It needs moist soil such as in a wet meadow or lake margin, even tolerating flooding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex squarrosa is found in eastern Missouri on the wet soils of swampy meadows and woods, flood plains, and wet prairies. Its narrow grass-like leaves grow up to 2' in height. The showy seedheads are thimble-shaped and remain on the plant all summer.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means with parts spreading or recurved at the ends.
","
Problems
The foliage may become less attractive or die back in summer.
","
Garden Uses
This sedge is good for stream bank restoration and for growing in areas with consistently wet soil such as around water gardens, lake margins, or wet meadows. Due to its shade tolerance, it is also useful in wooded areas but may require additional water.

Culture
Easily grown in moist to wet soils including standing water in full sun to part shade. Grows well in wet low spots, water margins and areas that experience some seasonal flooding. Tolerates shady conditions. Spreads by rhizomes to form large colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex stricta is a rhizomatous evergreen sedge that grows in dense tussocks (clumps) to 1-3' tall and to 2' wide. It is an emergent aquatic that is native primarily to wet swales, marshes, bogs, wet meadows and creek margins in eastern North America (Quebec to Ontario to North Dakota south to Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina). In Missouri, it is limited to several locations in calcareous, spring fed, swampy meadows in the Ozarks in the southeastern part of the State (Steyermark). Narrow, glaucous, grass-like leaves (to 3/8"" wide) grow in dense clumps. Older leaves turn straw brown as they die, and build up around the base of each clump surrounding the newer yellowish-green leaves. Flora of North America reports that plants grown in sites with seasonal flooding form distinctive large clumps, and plants grown in drier areas tend to spread more by rhizomes. Flowers appear in late spring in reddish-brown spikes atop stems rising above the foliage. Steyermark maintains that the scattered Missouri populations of this species are all that remains from an ancient Pleistocene presence that has gradually disappeared over time as the glaciers disappeared and the weather warmed.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means erect or upright.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in mass for foliage effect in moist to wet areas including ones with standing water. Flowers are not showy. Good selection for low spots, stream/pond margins or areas with seasonal flooding. Also may be grown in a variety of upland locations as long as soils are kept consistently moist. Effective accent for smaller gardens. Ground cover for shady areas.

Culture
Easily grown in medium to moist soils in full sun to part shade.  Best performance occurs in soils with consistent moisture.  Plants will self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex swanii, sometimes commonly called swan's sedge, is a perennial sedge (section Porocystis) that grows in loose rhizomatous clumps to 1-3' tall.  It is native to dry to wet-mesic forests in eastern and central North America (Nova Scotia to Ontario south to Arkansas, northern Alabama and Georgia).  In Missouri, this sedge is typically found in bottomland forests, swamps and acid seep margins (most commonly along Crowley's Ridge and the eastern Ozarks) in the far southeastern part of the State (Steyermark).  Plants feature pubescent, narrow, flat, grass-like, medium green leaves (each to 12"" long and 1/4"" wide).  Flowers bloom in spikes in late spring (May-June) on sparsely hairy, erect to arching flowering stems (reddish-purple bases) growing to 30"" long.  The terminal spikelet on each inflorescence has pistillate florets at the top and staminate florets at the base, but the lateral spikelets have only pistillate florets.  Flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).  Perigynia of this species are pubescent and  beakless.  

Swan's sedge is similar in appearance to hairy-fruited sedge (C. virescens), and was once known as Carex virescens var. swanii.  

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet  honors botanist Charles Walter Swan (1838-1921).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best grown in mass for foliage effect in consistently moist soils.  Flowers are not particularly showy.  Good selection for low spots or stream/pond margins.  Also may be grown in a variety of  upland locations as long as soils are kept consistently moist.  Effective accent for smaller gardens.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it forms a rhizomatous spreading ground cover.  North of Zone 8, it will not survive winter but may be grown as an annual.  It is easily grown in a wide range of medium moisture soils in part shade to full shade.  Best performance occurs in soils with regular moisture, but plants tolerate both periods of drought as well as moist to wet conditions.  Plants also tolerate full sun in native areas along the West coast.  Plants will spread by rhizomes and self-seeding to form a ground cover.  Propagate by seed or division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex tumulicola, sometimes commonly called foothill sedge or Berkeley sedge, is an evergreen perennial sedge that grows in arching clumps to 1-2' tall.  It is native to open woods, meadows and coastal prairies from the central coast of California north to Oregon and Washington.  Plants feature pubescent, narrow, grass-like, medium green leaves (to 18"" long and 1/8"" wide).   Brown, non-showy flowers bloom in spring atop stems rising above the foliage to 2' tall.  

Carex divulsa is a European species of Carex which at one point was sold in California by mistake as Carex tumulicola.  It differs inter alia from the California native by being a more aggressive spreader with winter hardiness to USDA Zone 4.

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this evergreen sedge will form an impressive ground cover which is not only ornamentally attractive but also helps stabilize soils and control erosion.  Flowers are somewhat insignificant.  Group or mass.  Also effective accent for borders or smaller gardens.  Can be mowed and used as a lawn substitute, particularly for difficult areas of the landscape.  True beauty of this sedge is in its evergreen foliage.  Birds are attracted to the plant's seed.

Culture
Grows well in damp to very wet soils in full sun to partial shade. Seeds should be planted in the fall or moist-stratified and planted in the spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex vulpinoidea is a Missouri native sedge, which grows on moist open ground in swamps, wet prairies or near water. It is one of the most abundant sedges in the state. Its narrow grass-like leaf blades grow in 2 feet clumps up to 3 feet in height. The seedheads, which spray out attractively from the center of the clump, resemble a fox's tail but are short-lived.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
This sedge may be weedy and spreads rapidly.
","
Garden Uses
Is useful for locations that remain moist such as around water gardens or near streams, springs, or ponds. It may also grow well in the partial shade of a moist woods.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. This plant is intolerant of frost. It is best grown in tropical or semi-tropical climates in rich, humusy, consistently moist but well-drained organic loams in full sun. Best fruit develops in full sun. Plants tolerate light shade if grown ornamentally instead of for fruit. In St. Louis, plants may be grown in large tubs that should be overwintered indoors in bright locations. Container plants may need to be replaced every 4-5 years. Papayas can be heavy feeders, so regular fertilization is necessary.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carica papaya, commonly called papaya, is a small, frost-tender, succulent, broadleaf evergreen tree that bears papaya fruits throughout the year. Each tree (Hortus Third asserts papaya is technically a giant herb because it never produces true woody tissue) typically has a single, unbranched, non-woody trunk bearing the scars of old leaf bases. The trunk is topped by an umbrella-like canopy of palmately lobed leaves. Large, fleshy, melon-like fruits (papayas) hang in clusters attached to the trunk top just under the leaf canopy. Papaya typically grows to 6-20' tall (container plants to 10' tall) and is most noted for its edible melon-like fruit. It is native to lowland tropical areas of Central and South America, but is now grown in tropical to subtropical regions throughout the world both commercially and in home gardens. In the U.S., it is commercially grown in southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii. Seven lobed leaves (to 2' wide) on leaf stalks to 2-3' long are ornamentally attractive. Species plants are typically dioecious (separate male and female trees), but cultivars are hermaphroditic. Fragrant, trumpet-shaped, yellowish-white flowers bloom throughout the year, with males in long racemes and females in small clusters or solitary. Female flowers give way to smooth-skinned green fruits that ripen to yellow-orange with a yellow to pinkish-orange flesh and central cavity of pea-sized black seeds. Fruits and seeds are edible. Commercially sold fruits are typically 6-8"" long and weigh about one pound, but fruits in the wild in ideal growing conditions can grow much larger with a wieght of up to 20 pounds. Papain (an enzyme extracted from the milky sap of green fruit) is popularly used as a meat tenderizer, chewing gum additive and beer clarifier plus for a large number of additional medical, cosmetic and industrial purposes.Genus name comes from Greek meaning a kind of fig in reference to the fig-shaped leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rots may occur in overly moist soils. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Grown for fruit production. Trees are short-lived, but have some ornamental value as large-leaved tropical plants.

Culture
Easily grown in sandy to loamy, well-draining, soil in full sun. In hotter conditions, can benefit from some afternoon shade. Tolerant of drought and dry soils once established, but will appreciate the occasional soaking during hot, dry periods of the summer. This plant does not tolerate wet soils however, so care should be taken to not overwater. Hardy in Zones 8-10. Pruning can be utilized after flowering to shape this shrub into a desired form and to remove long, leggy stems.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carpenteria californica, commonly called bush anemone or tree anemone, is a medium-sized, densely branched evergreen shrub narrowly endemic to the dry, granite slopes of the western foothills of California's Sierra Nevada Mountains in Fresno and Madera counties. Quite rare in the wild, this plant is more well known in cultivation. In the home garden, it typically reaches 6' tall and 3' wide, though in ideal conditions it can grow up to 12' tall and 8' wide. The narrow, lance-shaped to elliptical leaves are 3-5"" long, somewhat leathery, glossy, and dark green in color, with dense, white hairs on the undersides. Showy, fragrant, flowers (3"" in diameter) with white petals and numerous bright, yellow stamens bloom in clusters from late spring to early summer.The genus Carpenteria honors William Marbury Carpenter (1811-1848), a natural scientist of the southern United States.The specific epithet californica refers to the native range of this species.The common names bush anemone and tree anemone refer to the similarities of the flowers of this species to those of the genus Anemone, particularly the five-petaled form and showy, yellow stamens.'Elizabeth' is smaller in most respects compared to the species. Its maximum size is 6' tall and 3' wide, with a more compact habit. The flowers are also smaller, only around 1.5"" in diameter, but this cultivar is more floriferous and equally as fragrant. The flowers bloom in clusters of up to 20. Named after California botanist Elizabeth McClintock (1912-2004).
","
Problems
This plant, particularly when under stress, is susceptible to aphids. Insecticidal soaps and oils can be effect treatments for aphids if caught early, but large infestations can disfigure the young growing buds. Scale can also be problematic. The best course of action is to address what may be causing the plant stress, including soil conditions and overwatering.
","
Garden Uses
Use in dry, native-focused landscapes and pollinator gardens. Can be pruned after flowering into a more formal shape if desired. Could make a lovely informal hedge.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Needs little pruning when grown as a tree, but responds well to hard pruning if grown as a hedge. Best pruned during the period of late summer to mid-winter to avoid significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carpinus betulus commonly called European hornbeam is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 80’) tall with a pyramidal to oval-rounded crown. Ovate, sharply-toothed, dark green leaves (to 5” long) are clean and attractive throughout the growing season with little susceptibility to foliar diseases. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow to orange in fall. Monoecious flowering catkins form in early spring before the foliage emerges. Male catkins (to 1.5” long) are yellowish and female catkins (to 3” long) are greenish. Fruits are small nutlets in 3-lobed bracts that appear in drooping 5” long clusters in summer. Trunks have smooth gray bark and distinctive muscle-like fluting.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name.Specific epithet is in reference to the birch-like (Betulus) characteristics of this species.Common name comes from the extremely hard wood of this tree that will take a horn-like polish and was once used in Europe to make yokes for oxen (the beam between the ox horns).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carpinus caroliniana, commonly called American hornbeam, is a slow-growing, deciduous, small to medium-sized understory tree with an attractive globular form. It is native to Missouri where it is typically found in rich moist woods, valleys, ravine bottoms and rocky slopes along streams throughout the eastern and Ozark regions of the state (Steyermark). Typically grows 20-35' tall. The smooth, gray trunk and larger branches of a mature tree exhibit a distinctive muscle-like fluting that has given rise to another common name of musclewood for this tree. Flowers appear in spring in separate male and female catkins, with the female catkins giving way to distinctive clusters of winged nutlets. Serrated, elliptic-oval, dark green leaves often produce respectable shades of yellow, orange and red in fall. The extremely hard wood of this tree will, as the common name suggests, take a horn-like polish and was once used by early Americans to make bowls, tool handles and ox yokes. Commercial use of hornbeam wood is not practicable, however, due to the limited amount of wood that can be harvested per tree.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name.Specific epithet means of North or South Carolina.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spots, cankers and twig blight are occasional disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
An attractively shaped, low-maintenance understory tree for shady sites. May be grown in lawns or naturalized in woodland areas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carya cordiformis, commonly called bitternut hickory, is a medium to large, broadly columnar, deciduous tree that typically grows 50-80’ tall with an irregular, oval-rounded crown. It is native to forested areas (wet bottom lands to some upland dry sites) in the eastern and central U.S. and Canada. In Missouri, it is found throughout the state in a variety of locations including low woods, river bottoms along streams, sloughs, ponds and slope/bluff bases (Steyermark). Compound, odd-pinnate, light to medium green leaves (each to 6-12” long) have 5-9 ovate-lanceolate leaflets. Leaflets grow 3-6” long. Leaves turn yellow in fall. Non-showy, monoecious, green flowers bloom in April-May, with the male flowers in catkins (to 4” long) and the female flowers on short spikes. Female flowers give way to fruits (inedible rounded nuts), but only after the tree reaches about 25 years old. Each nut is encased in a husk which splits open in fall when ripe. Although the nuts are, as the common name suggests, bitter tasting and unpalatable to humans, some mammals (e.g., squirrels) eat them. Smooth gray bark develops ridges as it matures. Buds turn a bright mustard yellow in winter, which can be a significant aid in tree identification. Several species of moth are attracted to the foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek word karya used for walnut trees.Specific epithet comes from Latin cordata (heart-shaped) in probable reference to the fruit husks.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Hickory bark beetle, pecan weevil, borers and twig girdler can be problems in some areas of its range. White heart rot, anthracnose, leaf blotch, powdery mildew, leaf spot, catkin blight and crown gall are occasional diseases. Large trees can produce considerable litter through twig, leaf and fruit (nut) drop.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carya glabra, commonly called pignut hickory, is a medium to large, deciduous tree with a straight trunk and rounded crown that typically grows 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall. It is primarily native to hillsides and ridges in somewhat dry soils, but may also be found in some moist soils. It grows throughout the eastern and central U. S., with concentrations in Appalachian forests and the Ohio River valley. In Missouri, it is found in dry upland ridges in the far southeastern part of the State (Steyermark). Compound, odd-pinnate, dark yellowish-green leaves (each to 6-12” long) have 5-7, toothed, ovate-lanceolate leaflets. Leaflets grow 3-6” long. Leaves turn an attractive yellow in fall. Gray bark develops scaly ridges as it matures. Non-showy, monoecious, yellowish-green flowers bloom in April-May, with the male flowers in drooping catkins (to 3” long) and the female flowers on short spikes. Female flowers give way to fruits (rounded nuts), but only after the tree reaches about 25 years old. Each nut is encased in a ridged husk which partially splits open in fall when ripe. Although the nuts are usually bitter and unpalatable to humans, some mammals (e.g., squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons and black bears) eat them. Hogs were found by early U.S. settlers to eat the nuts, thus giving rise to the common name of pignut hickory. Settlers also split saplings to make brooms, hence the additional common name of broom hickory.Genus name comes from the Greek word karya used for walnut trees.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning smooth in reference to the hairless leaves and twigs of this tree.

Nut production can be sparse in the northern part of its growing range, particularly when spring is late and summer is cool. May be grown from seed, but it normally takes 8-10 years for a young tree to bear a nut crop.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carya illinoinensis, commonly called hardy pecan, is a large deciduous lowland tree that is the largest of the hickories.  It typically grows 75-100’ (infrequently to 150’) tall with a large rounded spreading crown.  Trunks mature to 2-4’ in diameter.  It is native from Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio south to Alabama and Mexico, being primarily found in the Mississippi River valley and the valleys of its principal tributaries.  Pecan features medium green, odd-pinnate, compound leaves, with each leaf having 9-17 pointed leaflets.  Leaflets range from 2-7” long.  Leaves mature to yellow green in summer, eventually turning yellow brown in fall.  Non-showy, monoecious greenish yellow flowers appear in April-May, the male flowers in pendulous catkins (to 4” long) and the female flowers in short spikes.  Female flowers give way to sweet, edible nuts.  Each nut is encased in a thin husk which splits open in four sections when ripe in fall.  Pecans are an important commercial nut crop in the U.S.  Most pecan commercial plantings are located in the southern U.S., from North Carolina to Florida west to Arizona and California.  Many cultivars are available.Genus name comes from the Greek word karya used for walnut trees.Specific epithet means of Illinois, which is part of its native range.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Scab can infect both nuts and foliage, although scab resistant cultivars are available. Aphids, pecan weevils, twig girdlers and fall webworms can also do damage.

Best grown in humusy, rich, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. This tree needs a very large space within which to grow. In the wild, it grows in areas that are periodically flooded. It is difficult to transplant because of its deep taproot. Cross-pollination generally produces a more abundant crop of better quality nuts.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carya laciniosa, commonly called shellbark hickory, is a large deciduous lowland tree that is native from New York to Iowa south to Tennessee and Oklahoma. It primarily occurs in the Ohio and upper Mississippi River valleys. In Missouri, it is most frequently found in low woods, bottomland, river flood plains and streambanks along the major streams and rivers in the state (Steyermark). It typically grows 60-80’ (infrequently to 120’) tall with a narrow rounded crown. Trunks mature to 3-4’ in diameter. This tree features odd-pinnate compound leaves, each leaf having 7 (less frequently 5 or 9) dark green, finely-toothed, broadly lance-shaped, pointed leaflets. Leaflets range from 4-8” long. Leaves turn yellow to golden brown in fall. Non-showy, monoecious greenish yellow flowers appear in April-May, the male flowers in pendulous catkins (to 4-8” long) and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to edible egg-shaped nuts. Each nut is encased in a very thick husk which splits open in four sections when ripe in fall. Nuts are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Bark of young trees is gray and smooth, but exfoliates in long strips with age. This tree is very similar in appearance to shagbark hickory (see C. ovata), except shellbark has inter alia (1) leaves with 7 leaflets, (2) thicker husks on the nuts, (3) orange-brown twigs and (4) less pronounced bark exfoliation. This tree is sometimes also commonly called king nut hickory in reference to the fact that shellbark nuts are the largest in size of the hickories.Genus name comes from the Greek word karya used for walnut trees.Specific epithet means shredded in reference to the shaggy bark.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carya ovata, commonly called shagbark hickory, is a large deciduous tree that typically grows 70-90’ (infrequently to 120’) tall with an irregular, oval-rounded crown. It is native from Quebec to Minnesota south to Georgia and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs on both dry upland wooded slopes and hills and in moist valleys and lowland woods throughout the state (Steyermark). Trunks mature to 2-3’ in diameter. This tree features smooth, medium yellow-green, odd-pinnate, compound leaves, each leaf having 5 (less frequently 7 or 9) finely-toothed, broadly lance-shaped, pointed leaflets. Leaflets range from 3-7” long. Leaves turn yellow to golden brown in fall. Non-showy, monoecious greenish yellow flowers appear in April-May, the male flowers in pendulous catkins (to 3-5” long) and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to edible oval-rounded nuts. Each nut is encased in a moderately thick husk which splits open in four sections when ripe in fall. Nuts were an important food source to Native Americans and early settlers, and are commercially sold today. Nuts are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Bark of young trees is gray and smooth, but exfoliates in long strips with age. The exfoliation is more recurved and pronounced than on the similar-in-appearance shellbark hickory (see C. laciniosa). Hickory wood is often used to cure/smoke meats. It is also an excellent firewood/fuel. The wood is extremely hard and is used to make a variety of products including tool handles, ladders, gun stocks and furniture. Andrew Jackson, 7th president of the U.S., was affectionately known as Old Hickory in recognition of his tough character.Genus name comes from the Greek word karya used for walnut trees.Specific epithet means egg-shaped.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carya tomentosa, commonly called mockernut hickory, is a medium to large, deciduous tree with a straight trunk and rounded crown that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall. It is primarily native to hillsides and ridges in somewhat dry soils. It grows throughout the eastern and central U.S., with concentrations of tall trees in the Ohio River valley and Mississippi River valley. In Missouri, it is found in dry upland woods, ridges and slopes throughout the State, except it is not present in the southeastern lowlands and northwestern corner (Steyermark). Compound, odd-pinnate, dark yellowish-green leaves (each to 6-12” long) have 5-7, toothed, ovate-lanceolate leaflets. Leaflets grow 3-6” long. Leaflet undersides are downy and glandular. Rachis and petiole are pubescent. Leaflets are aromatic when cut or bruised. Leaves turn an attractive yellow in fall. Thin dark gray bark develops furrows and flattened ridging as it matures. Non-showy, monoecious, yellowish-green flowers bloom in April-May, with the male flowers in drooping catkins (to 6” long) and the female flowers on short spikes. Female flowers give way to fruits (rounded nuts), but only after the tree reaches about 25 years old. Each nut is encased in a thick, four-grooved husk which splits open in fall when ripe. Nuts are edible for humans but can be very difficult to extract from the husks, hence the common name of mockernut. Nuts are eaten by a variety of mammals including squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, raccoons and black bears. Light colored sap wood of this tree gives rise to a sometimes used common name of white hickory.Genus name comes from the Greek word karya used for walnut trees.Specific epithet means with short hairs in reference to the leaflet undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Hickory bark beetle, pecan weevil, borers and twig girdler can be problems in some areas of its range. White heart rot, anthracnose, leaf blotch, powdery mildew, leaf spot, cankers, catkin blight, crown gall and scab are occasional diseases. Large trees can produce considerable litter through twig, leaf and fruit (nut) drop.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cassia fistula, commonly called golden shower tree, is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to 30-40' tall in an upright form often open at the top.  It is native to India, Malaysia and Southeast Asia.  It is well-known for producing a show-stopping bloom of yellow flowers in May-June/July.  Even pinnate compound leaves to 12-16"" long with 4-8 pairs of ovate-lanceolate leaflets (each leaflet to 4"" long) per leaf.  Leaves usually drop in April as a prelude to flowering which occurs from May to early July.  Five-petaled, bright yellow flowers bloom in 8-18"" pendulous terminal racemes which cover the tree with profuse bloom.  Flowers are lightly scented.  Leaves return as the flowering progresses, with foliage totally restored by July.  Tree is often considered to be semi-deciduous or semi-evergreen because of this brief loss of leaves.  A second less significant bloom often occurs in September but without loss of leaves.  Flowers are followed by slender, terete, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long.  Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year.  Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.  Golden shower tree is the National tree of Thailand and the national flower of Thailand.  Popular plant as ornamental and for herbal medicine.  Dried fruit has medicinal properties.  Is now widely grown in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet means hollow like a pipe.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some tolerance for brief light frost with temperatures to 25 degrees F.  Mildew and leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental.  Shade tree.  Formerly planted in some populated areas as a street tree, but this use has waned as planners have shifted to using Cassia x nealiae for this purpose because this hybrid does not drop as many leaves at flowering time and does not produce any seed pods.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cassia grandis, commonly called pink shower, is a medium-sized tree that typically matures to 40-60' tall, but sometimes to as much as 100' tall in the lowland forests of its native habitat in Central and northern South America.   It is noted for producing large pinnate leaves, a showy display of pink flowers in spring and large bean-like seed pods.   This tree is now grown primarily as an ornamental in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.  Each even-pinnate compound leaf (6-10"" long) has 8-20 pairs of small elliptic-oblong leaflets (each to 2.5"" long).  This tree is considered semi-evergreen (drops some leaves during the year, sometimes during dry season).  This tree is particularly noted for producing a show-stopping bloom of coral pink flowers arranged in 4-10"" long drooping racemes (20-40 flowers per raceme) in early spring.  Leaf drop often occurs in winter with the new leaves emerging on the tree in February as the flowers appear.  Bloom time extends from February-April, but in some climates begins later in spring extending into summer.  Flowers are followed by slender, woody bean pods which grow to 2' (infrequently to 3') long.  Each pod has 70-80 seeds.  Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year.  Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet means big or showy.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cassia leptophylla, commonly called gold medallion tree, is a small open-crowned tree with spreading, slightly drooping branches.  It typically matures to 20-30' tall.   It is native to Brazil.  It is noted for producing large pinnate leaves, a showy display of yellow flowers in summer and large bean-like seed pods following the flowers.  This tree is now grown primarily as an ornamental in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.  It is noted for performing better in the climate of the State of California than other species of Cassia.  Each even-pinnate compound leaf (to 12-18"" long) has 9-14 pairs of small narrow leaflets (each to 2.5"" long).  This tree is considered to be semi-evergreen (drops some leaves during the year, sometimes in tropical climates having dry seasons and sometimes in winter if extended cool weather or a tinge of frost occurs).  This tree is particularly noted for producing a show-stopping bloom of fragrant yellow flowers (2-3"" wide) arranged in 6-10"" long terminal clusters (racemes), each containing 30-50 flowers.  Flowers bloom in summer sometimes extending into early fall.  Flowers are followed by slender, twisted, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long.  Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year.  Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet comes from Greek leptos meaning narrow and phyllon meaning leaf in reference to the narrow leaves of this tree.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Native to Japan, Chinese chestnut is a small to medium sized, broad, low-branched, deciduous tree that typically grows 30-40' tall with an open rounded crown.  It is primarily grown as an ornamental tree.  Its nuts are large and edible, but with a bitter flavor (high tannin content), and are generally considered to be much inferior in flavor to other chestnuts in the genus.  Japanese chestnut is noted for having resistance to chestnut blight which is the disease that has nearly wiped out the native American chestnut (see Castanea dentata).  Oblong-lanceolate, toothed, dark green leaves (3-7” long) are pubescent beneath.  Leaves turn varying shades of yellow and bronze in fall.  Aromatic, monoecious, creamy yellowish-white flowers appear in catkins in late spring (May-June in St. Louis), the male flowers located at the top portion of the catkin and the female flowers located near the base.  Flowers can be quite showy, albeit for a brief period.  Flowers are followed by edible chestnuts which are encased in spiny dehiscent burs (2-3” diameter), usually 2-3 nuts per bur.  Nut size is variable (from 2"" diameter to much smaller).  When the chestnuts are ripe, the burs turn yellow and split open.  Although Japanese chestnuts are sometime sold in farmers’ markets, it is the Spanish chestnut, Castanea sativa, that produces the chestnuts most often sold commercially in the U.S.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet means with a rounded scalloped edge.
","
Problems
Japanese chestnut is resistant, but not immune, to chestnut blight (Endothia parasitica) which is a fatal fungal bark disease.  Also susceptible to leaf spot, anthracnose and twig and stem cankers. Weevils can be a problem in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful specimen shade tree for lawns.  Unfortunately, as is the case with the fruit of the sweet gum but perhaps more so, falling chestnuts can pose a significant litter problem, and often make walking barefoot in the lawn a real adventure.  On the positive side, the chestnuts may be harvested for roasting on an open fire as it were.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Castanea dentata, commonly called American chesnut, was once a major component of the Eastern hardwood forest. It is almost extinct in the wild now, having succumbed to chestnut blight, a bark fungal disease that probably entered the U.S. in a shipment of nursery stock from Japan in the late 1890s. American chestnut now persists mostly in the form of sprouts from old stumps and root systems. Typically the sprouts grow up and possibly flower and fruit for several years before dying back from the blight. Before blight introduction, mature trees typically reached 50-75’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with globular spreading crowns. Oblong-lanceolate, toothed, dull green leaves (6-10” long) turn shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic creamy yellow-white male flowers are densely clustered in slender catkins (4-8” long). Female flowers appear in smaller inconspicuous catkins. Blooms in June. Small nuts (hazel nut size) are sweet and edible, and are encased in spiny burrs (2-3” diameter). H. W. Longfellow’s poem “The Village Blacksmith” begins with the line “Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands….” in reference to this once stately and popular American tree.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet means toothed in reference to the toothed leaves.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Castanea sativa, commonly called Spanish chestnut or sweet chestnut or European chestnut, is a large, pyramidal-rounded to broad-columnar deciduous tree in the beech family that typically matures to 80-100’ tall with a substantial trunk growing to as much as 7’ in diameter.  It is native to high forest areas of western Asia from Iran to the Balkans. Edible chestnuts have been cultivated from this tree for human consumption since ancient times.  Today this species is grown throughout much of Europe, northern Africa and southwestern Asia.  Growth is widespread in Great Britain where this tree was first introduced during the Roman occupation.  

Spanish chestnut was first planted in the eastern U.S. in Delaware in 1803.  It was commonly grown for almost 100 years without problems until a deadly chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) invaded the U.S. via a shipment of nursery stock from Japan in the late 1890’s.  The American chestnut (Castanea dentate), once a major component of the eastern U.S. hardwood forest, came under severe attack from this blight which became a death sentence for that species.  Spanish chestnut was for a short time considered to be a possible replacement in the eastern U.S. for the doomed American chestnut, but unfortunately Spanish chestnut was also susceptible to the blight, albeit to a lesser extent.  Although some naturalized pockets of Spanish chestnut continue to grow in a few eastern states including Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Alabama, the species is not commercially grown there as a food crop.  U.S. commercial growth is now limited to a small number of areas in western states where the blight is not yet a serious problem.

Chestnut blight appears to be much less aggressive in the cool and wet summer conditions in many parts of Europe that it is in the eastern U.S.  The vast majority of chestnuts consumed as food in the U.S. today are imported from Spanish chestnut cultivars/hybrids commercially grown in Europe (most from Italy).

Spanish chestnut features coarsely-toothed, oblong-lanceolate, dark green leaves (to 6-10” long), each leaf having about 20 pairs of prominent parallel veins.  Leaves are slightly furry with a lighter green color beneath.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Tiny, densely-clustered, monoecious flowers bloom in yellowish-green catkins (each to 4-8” long) in early to mid-summer. Flowers in the mid to upper portions of bisexual catkins are males, with a much smaller number of female flowers appearing at the base of such catkins.  Pollinated female flowers are followed by prickly husks, each containing 3-7 brownish nuts which fall from the tree in October.  Although C. sativa has separate male and female flowers on the same tree, these flowers are largely self-incompatible, thus more than one tree is normally planted in order to produce nuts (assuming nut production is a goal).  Purplish-gray bark develops fissures with age.    

Growth of chestnut trees in many parts of North America today is perhaps best done with blight resistant species such as Japanese chestnut (C. crenata) or Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) plus a number of blight resistant hybrids.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word sativa meaning sown or cultivated by humans (as opposed to wild).Common name of Spanish chestnut probably derives from the fact that some of the best chestnuts imported into England many years ago were grown in Spain.
","
Problems
Chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica formerly Endothia parasitica).  Development of blight-resistant cultivars and hybrids has been a priority for some time.  Also susceptible to leaf spots, anthracnose and powdery mildew.
","
Garden Uses
Large nut-producing tree that unfortunately is susceptible to chestnut blight.  Grown for production of edible nuts and/or ornamental value.  Matures into a dense shade tree.  Needs adequate space.  For ornamental use, it is best located in areas where litter from the tree (nuts falling to the ground) and unpleasant pollen aromas will not be a problem.  Excellent tree for parks and large gardens.  For culinary use, nuts may be roasted over a fire or preserved in syrup as the popular French delicacy called marrons glaces.

Culture
Best grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. This species is primarily biennial: basal rosette the first year and flowering stalk the second year, with plant death occurring shortly after seed set and with new seed usually germinating in early fall. Species is also semi-parasitic in that its roots will attach to and absorb some nutrients and water from the roots of certain other plants. Evidence suggests that paintbrush will perform best in cultivation when grown in combination with one or more of the plants it commonly parasitizes in the wild (e.g., Schizachyrium, Penstemon and/or Sisyrinchium). Difficult to grow from seed. Although plants will reseed in optimum growing conditions, reseeding alone is often not enough to keep plants in the garden unless new plants and/or additional seeding are done each year until a colony is established.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Castilleja coccinea, commonly called Indian paintbrush or painted cup, is a biennial member of the broomrape family (Orobanchaceae) that typically grows on unbranched stems to 1-1.5' tall (less frequently to 2'). It is a Missouri native which occurs in prairies, rocky glades, moist and open woodlands, thickets and streambanks in the eastern, central and southern parts of the State (Steyermark). The large, fan-shaped, orange-red ""flowers"" are actually brightly-colored, three-lobed, leafy bracts which appear at the stem tops in dense spikes and which surround and hide the tiny greenish-yellow true flowers. Blooms spring to early summer. Two types of medium green leaves: entire, lance-shaped leaves in a basal rosette and stem leaves divided into 3-5 deep, narrow lobes.Genus name comes from an 18th century botanist, Domingo Castillejo, of Cadiz, Spain.Specific epithet means scarlet.Common name of paintbrush refers to the supposed resemblance of the flowering plant to a brush dipped in paint.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Plant foliage disappears in early summer shortly after seed set. Difficult to establish and keep in a garden.
","
Garden Uses
Perhaps best reserved for naturalizing in native plant gardens, prairies or glades.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions including both wet and dry soils. Tolerant of seasonal flooding. Prefers moist fertile loams.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Catalpa bignonioides, commonly called Southern catalpa, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that typically grows to 30-40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with an irregular, broad-rounded crown. It is native to a relatively small area extending from central Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia south to the Florida panhandle. It most often occurs in moist soils along streams and river banks. Very broad leaves (to 10” long and 6” wide) are short-pointed at the tip and rounded or heart-shaped at the base. Leaves are light green above and pubescent below. Leaves emit a somewhat disagreeable aroma when bruised. Bell-shaped, fragrant, white flowers (to 1.5” across) with purple and yellow inner markings bloom in May-June in many-flowered upright panicles (to 10” tall). Flowers are very ornamental. After flowering, seeds appear in long narrow pods (to 15” long). Pods mature to dark brown in fall and then split open lengthwise to release the seeds. Seed pods give rise to the additional common name of cigar tree.Genus name comes from a North American Indian name.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Bignonia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, leaf spots, mildew, dieback, anthracnose and twig blight. The larvae (caterpillars) of the catalpa sphinx moth may do considerable damage when feeding on the leaves. Watch for mealybugs, aphids, scale and whiteflies.
","
Garden Uses
A mature, symmetrically rounded catalpa tree can be a tree of great beauty, particularly in spring when the foliage is young and the flowers are in bloom. Unfortunately, it is otherwise a rather coarse tree that many believe does not deserve a prominent place in the landscape. Branches are brittle and mature trees infrequently exhibit classic form. Foliage also tends to depreciate as the growing season progresses, the large leaves being subject to damage from hail, wind, insects and sometimes disease. It has been widely planted in urban areas as a street tree and lawn tree, and can also be effectively used in the landscape for difficult areas such as moist low spots or dry areas with poor soils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Catalpa fargesii f. duciouxii, sometimes commonly called Chinese bean tree, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree with an open rounded crown that is native to central China. It was discovered by westerners around 1900, and was subsequently named after French plant collector Pere Francois Ducloux. This catalpa is most distinguished by its attractive foliage and spectacular flowers. Unlobed, broad-ovate leaves with pointed tips emerge in spring with bronze tinges, but mature to a rich medium green. Rosy-pink flowers with purple-brown spotting bloom in panicles in late spring (May-June). Flowers of this plant are considered to be ornamentally superior to the flowers of most other catalpas. Flowers give way to extremely narrow seedpods (to 1/4” wide) that may grow to as long as 30”. The seedpods mature in fall to dark brown and then split open lengthwise to release the seeds within.Genus name comes from a North American Indian name.Specific epithet honors Pere Paul Guillaume Farges (1844-1912), French missionary, naturalist and plant collector.

","
Garden Uses
A mature, symmetrically rounded catalpa tree can be a tree of great beauty, particularly in spring and early summer when the foliage is young and the flowers are in bloom. Unfortunately, it is otherwise a rather coarse tree that does not always deserve a prominent place in the landscape. Branches are brittle and mature trees infrequently exhibit classic form. Foliage also tends to depreciate as the growing season progresses, the large leaves being subject to damage from hail, wind, insects and sometime disease. It can be effectively used in the landscape for difficult areas such as moist low spots or dry areas with poor soils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Catalpa ovata, commonly called Chinese catalpa, yellow catalpa and Japanese catalpa, is a small deciduous tree that typically grows to 30’ tall and as wide with a spreading crown. It is native to forested areas in western China. Broad-ovate, light green leaves (to 10” long and wide) are usually entire but sometimes 3-5 lobed. Leaves abruptly taper to points at the tips and are mostly cordate at the bases. Leaves are glabrous except for downy leaf veins beneath. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow in fall. Flowers are attractive, but not as showy as C. bignoniodes (southern catalpa) and C. speciosa (northern catalpa). Bell-shaped, orchid-like, yellowish-white flowers (each to 3/4” long) with purple and orange inner spotting appear in panicles (to 10” long) in late spring (late May to early June in St. Louis). Flowers give way to long, slender, green seedpods (to 16” long and 1/3” wide). The seedpods mature in fall to dark brown and then split open lengthwise to release the seeds within. Bark of mature trees is fissured, prominently ridged and pale gray-brown. Chinese catalpa has escaped gardens and naturalized in some states in the eastern U.S.Genus name comes from a North American Indian name.Specific epithet means ovate or egg-shaped.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Catalpa speciosa, commonly called northern catalpa, is a medium to large, deciduous tree that typically grows to 40-70’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with an irregular, open-rounded to narrow-oval crown. It is native to a relatively small area extending from western Tennessee, northeastern Arkansas and the lowlands of southeastern Missouri north to southern Illinois and southern Indiana. In Missouri, it typically occurs along streams, bluff bases and in both low and upland woods (Steyermark). Broad ovate to ovate-oblong leaves (to 12” long) are pointed at the tips and rounded to cordate at the bases. Leaves are light green to yellow green above and densely pubescent below. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow in fall. Flowers can be a real showstopper, however. Bell-shaped, orchid-like white flowers (to 2” long) with purple and yellow inner spotting appear in panicles in late spring (late May to early June in St. Louis). Flowers give way to long slender green seedpods (12-22” long). The seedpods mature in fall to dark brown and then split open lengthwise to release the seeds within. Seedpods give rise to the common name of cigar tree, although they actually are longer and thinner than most cigars. Abundant pods are produced every 2 to 3 years. Bark of mature trees is fissured, prominently ridged and pale gray-brown. The leaves of this species do not emit an unpleasant aroma when bruised as is the case with the similar southern catalpa (Catalpa bignonioides).Genus name comes from a North American Indian name.Specific epithet means showy.

Culture
Best grown in loose, sandy-humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid unamended heavy clay soils. Also avoid wet soils, especially in winter. Plants have some drought tolerance. Plants may be grown from seed. In optimum growing conditions, plants will self seed in the garden. Plants do not perform well in the deep South (south of USDA Zone 7) due to high summer heat and humidity.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Catananche caerulea, commonly called Cupid’s dart, is a short-lived, clump-forming perennial of the aster family. Blue to lavender-blue flowers (to 2” diameter) with dark centers bloom singly on naked wiry stems rising to 2’ tall from a mostly basal clump of narrow, lanceolate, grass-like, gray-green leaves (each 8-12” long). Each flower is subtended by overlapping papery bracts. Flowers bloom freely from mid-summer to autumn. Early Greeks and Romans used this Mediterranean native to make love potions, hence the genus name and common name of Cupid’s dart.Genus name comes from the Greek name meaning a strong incentive.Specific epithet means dark blue in reference to flower color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for powdery mildew.
","
Garden Uses
Free flowering perennial for beds, border fronts and cottage gardens. Best when massed. Cutting gardens. Excellent for dried flower arrangements.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it grows as a woody based perennial. In the St. Louis area, it is best grown as an annual bedding plant in well-drained sandy loams in full sun to part shade. Needs regular moisture, but avoid overhead watering. Superior soil drainage is the key to growing this annual well. Start seeds indoors 12-16 weeks before last frost date. Set out seedlings or purchased starter plants in spring after last frost date. Thrives in hot and humid summer weather. Cuttings may be taken from plants in late summer for overwintering so as to provide a stock the following spring. Container plants may be overwintered indoors. May self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Catharanthus roseus, commonly called periwinkle, Madagascar periwinkle or annual vinca, is an erect to spreading tender perennial in the dogbane family typically mounding 6-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall and as wide. It produces attractive bushy foliage that is covered by an often profuse bloom of phlox-like flowers from summer to frost. Best flowering is in summer. Tubular flowers have five flattened petal-like lobes and appear singly in the upper leaf axils. Species flowers are rosy-pink to red with mauve throats. However, species plants are seldom seen in commerce today, having been largely replaced by larger flowered cultivars, many of which are dwarf to compact plants that sometimes have overlapping petals. Cultivars expand the available color range to include pale pink, rose, hot pink, red, lilac, and white, often with contrasting darker throats/eyes. Oblong to ovate glossy green leaves (to 2” long). Synonymous with and formerly know as Vinca rosea.Specific epithet means rose colored.

Culture
Best grown in shady woodland areas in rich, moist, neutral to slightly acidic soils. Needs consistently moist soils that do not dry out. Plants may be grown from seed, but usually will not flower until the third or fourth year. May be divided, but established plants are generally best left undisturbed. Can spread very slowly by rhizomes over time to form colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caulophyllum thalictroides, commonly called blue cohosh, is a Missouri native perennial which grows 1-3' tall on strong, upright stems. It is valued not for its flowers but for its lacy, ternately-compound, blue-green foliage and its erect clusters of blue, fruit-like seeds. Foliage is suggestive of meadow rue (Thalictrum), hence the species name. Leaves appear at mid-stem, emerging a smoky blue in spring and turning bluish-green at maturity. Young plants are covered with a whitish, waxy bloom. Inconspicuous, brownish-green to yellowish-green flowers (1/2"" diameter), each with 6 pointed sepals, appear in spring. Flowers give way in summer to attractive blue berry-like seeds (outer seed coating turns fleshy and blue as seeds mature) which resemble small grapes and provide good ornamental interest into fall after foliage decline has occurred.Genus name comes from the Greek words kaulos meaning a stem and phyllon meaning a leaf.Specific epithet means like the genus Thalictrum.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slow to establish from seed. Berry-like seeds are poisonous.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in sandy loams or rocky soils with good drainage. Thick, woody, red roots go deep and help plant withstand droughty conditions, but make established shrubs difficult to transplant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ceanothus americanus, commonly called New Jersey tea, is a compact, dense, rounded shrub which typically grows 2-3' tall (less frequently to 4'). It is native to Missouri where it occurs in prairies, glades, dry open woods and thickets throughout the state (Steyermark). Cylindrical clusters (1-2"" long) of tiny, fragrant, white flowers (1/8"") appear on long stalks at the stem ends or upper leaf axils in late spring. Toothed, broad-ovate, medium to dark green leaves (to 4"" long) are gray and hairy below. Young twigs are noticeably yellow and stand out in winter.Genus name comes from keanothos which is an ancient Greek name relating to some plants in the buckthorn family.Specific epithet means from America, North or South.Dried leaves were used as a tea substitute, albeit without caffeine, in American Revolutionary War times, hence the common name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to leaf spot and powdery mildew.
","
Garden Uses
Shrub borders or native plant gardens. Also effective as a shrubby ground cover for hard-to-grow areas such as dry rocky slopes and banks.

Culture
Best grown in medium to dry, alkaline, well-draining soils in full sun. Drought tolerant once established. This plant has a deep and extensive root system, and should not be disturbed once established. Can be grown in an area with some light shade, but prefers full sun. Hardy in Zones 4-8.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ceanothus herbaceus, commonly known as inland New Jersey tea or prairie redroot, is a small, upright, deciduous shrub native to glades, rocky prairie slopes, and sandy, loess hills in the central United States. In Missouri this species is mostly restricted to the western part of the state where it is relatively uncommon. This plant can reach up to 3' tall with a 2' spread. The new growth emerges in spring on slender stems with green to redish bark. The glossy leaves (between 1-2"" long and 0.5-1"" wide) are elliptic to lanceolate in shape, have prominent venation, and serrated margins. Small, white flowers borne in rounded, dense, terminal clusters (up to 3"" in diameter) appear April to June. The fruits are small, dark brown to black capsules with three segments. This plant is attractive to butterflies and other insect pollinators, and is a known host plant for the mottled duskywing and spring azure butterflies. Birds eat the seeds and use this shrub for cover and nesting habitat.Genus name comes from keanothos which is an ancient Greek name relating to some plants in the buckthorn family.The specific epithet herbaceus means herbaceous or not woody, in reference to the tendency of this species to send up herbaceous to semi-woody new growth that dies back in the winter.The common name of inland New Jersey tea comes from this plant's native range as compared to the related plant Ceanothus americanus, commonly called New Jersey tea. The range of C. americanus extends from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. The dried leaves were used by various Native American tribes to make a medicinal tea. A red dye can be obtained from the roots, hence the common name prairie redroot.
","
Problems
No known pest or disease problems. Deer and rabbits will readily browse this plant.
","
Garden Uses
This plant will do well in moderately dry and sunny locations in the garden provided there is good drainage. Suitable for rock gardens, gravel gardens, native gardens or naturalized areas. Also useful for hard-to-grow areas such as dry rocky slopes and banks.

Culture
Best grown in deep, moist but well-drained, acidic loams in full sun. Drought tolerant once established. Intolerant of poorly drained wet soils. Best tolerance of the true cedars for hot and humid summers. Not reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area where this tree probably should not be grown. If attempted, however, site young trees in locations protected from winter winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cedrus deodara, know as Deodar cedar, is an evergreen conifers that is pyramidal when young, maturing to flat-topped trees with broad-spreading horizontal branching. Deodar cedar is perhaps the most pendulous of the true cedars, with drooping branchlets and branching that is gracefully drooping at the tips. Lower branches typically remain on the tree as it ages, often touching the ground. This is a medium-growing tree that typically matures to 40-50’ tall in its first 25 years. In its native habitat, trees reportedly will grow much taller over time, sometimes reaching 150-200’ tall. Dark grayish-green needles (to 1.25” long) appear in clusters. Upright cones (to 4” long). It is native to the Himalayas.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet comes from the North Indian name of this plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Tip blight and root rot may occur. Winter hardiness is a concern in the St. Louis area where consideration should be given to planting a cultivar such as ‘Shalimar’ that has slightly better hardiness than the species. Notwithstanding the winter hardiness problems, these plants usually struggle in the St. Louis area where environmental conditions do not favor most conifers.

Cedrus libani, commonly called cedar of Lebanon, is an evergreen conifer that, with age, develops a massive trunk, a flattened top and broad spreading horizontal branching.  It is native to mountainous areas of Lebanon, Syria and Turkey.  Lower branches typically remain on the tree as it ages, often touching the ground.  It is a slow-growing tree that may reach only 20’ tall in its first 20 years.  Over time, cedar of Lebanon will typically grow to 40-60’ (infrequently to 120’ or more) tall.   This tree is the national emblem of Lebanon. It appears in the center of the flag of Lebanon.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet means of Mount Lebanon, Lebanon.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.  Intolerant of frost.  Fast-growing tree.  Best sited in moist well-drained soils in full sun.  Water needs vary during the year.  Trees appreciate abundant moisture during their vegetative period, but prefer much less moisture in winter during the dry season (December – February in southern Florida) when trees have lost most of their leaves or are deciduous.  Flowers typically begin blooming in February near the end of the dry season, followed by fruiting.  New foliage typically begins to appear shortly after flowering.  Propagate from seed or cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ceiba pentandra, commonly known as kapok or silk-cotton tree, is a fast-growing (to 13’ per year), deciduous (leaves drop during the dry season) tropical tree of the Bombax family that typically matures to 75-125’, but infrequently soars to as much as 230’ tall with a broad-spreading, somewhat flattened crown consisting of nearly horizontal branching.  This large tree is perhaps best known as being the source of kapok which is a cotton-like, water-resistant fiber harvested from the seed pods.  Kapok was at one time a popular down-like substance used as a stuffing for mattresses, life jackets, pillows, upholstery and as insulation.  Although once commercially popular, kapok fiber has now been largely replaced by synthetics.  

This tree is native to tropical America from Mexico south through Central America and the northern parts of South America to the Amazon basin. It probably was introduced into Africa many years ago, one theory being that unopened seed pods, which do not sink in water, floated from eastern Latin America to Africa.  It is believed to be the tallest tree on the continent of Africa.  It is now common in many areas of the tropics around the world.

Massive, straight, often spiny trunks on mature trees have wide spreading buttresses at the base.  Trunk diameter on average size trees will reach 6’ at maturity, but may extend to as much as 9’ or more on large trees.  Palmate compound leaves have 5-9 leaflets (each 3-7” long) with all leaflets extending outward from a single point at the base of the leaf.  Creamy white to pink flowers bloom in clusters before the leaves appear.  Flowers have bell-shaped calyces with five shallow lobes, five pubescent, oblong to spatulate petals, and 5 stamens fused into a tube.  Pungent-smelling flowers attract bats which in turn help pollinate the flowers.  Fruits are ellipsoid woody capsules (3-6” long and 2” diameter) each of which contains up to 200 tiny seeds embedded in cotton-like kapok.  Each tree may produce up to 4,000 fruits each season, which amounts to a lot of kapok (800,000 seeds per tree per season).  Capsules split open when ripe to release the silky seeds which are easily distributed by wind.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the South American name for the silk cotton tree.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words pente meaning five and andro meaning stamen in reference to plant flowers having five stamens.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Easily grown in most soils.  Best in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun.  Lean soils help restrain growth.  Will grow in part shade, but needs full sun for best flowering and subsequent fruit display.  Prune in late winter to early spring.  Mature vines require little pruning other than removal of dead or excess growth.  These plants are primarily dioecious (separate male and female plants),  although some plants have a few perfect flowers.  Female plants need a male pollinator to produce the attractive fruit that is the signature of this vine.  Unfortunately, some nurseries do not sell the vines as male or female (as is commonly done with hollies).  Generally one male plant is needed for 6-9 female plants.  Female plants may be vegetatively propagated to create more female plants.  Vines may be grown on structures or allowed to ramble along the ground.  It is generally best to avoid growing vines up small trees or through shrubs because vines grow rapidly and can girdle trunks and branches causing damage and sometimes death.  Vines sucker at the roots to form large colonies in the wild.  Vines will also aggressively self-seed, often with assistance from local bird populations. 

Notwithstanding its ornamental assets, this plant is considered to be an invasive weed in many parts of the eastern U.S. because of its ability to spread aggressively in the landscape.  Michael Dirr recommends that this plant “needs to be outlawed as a real biological gun-slinger (seed disperser).”
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celastrus orbiculatus, commonly known as Chinese bittersweet or oriental bittersweet, is a perennial, deciduous,  twining woody vine that can grow to 60’ long or more with a stem diameter of up to 4”.  Growth habit is climbing and/or sprawling.  It is native to Korea, China and Japan, but was introduced into the U.S. around 1860 as an ornamental vine.  It has escaped cultivation in the eastern U.S. since its introduction and has naturalized in a variety of locations including mixed hardwood forests, forest margins, fields, old homesites, and road margins.  It is currently included on a number of invasive species lists.  Ornamental attributes include (a) brown straited bark, (b) alternate elliptical to circular light green leaves (2-5”) which turn yellow in fall, (c) small, inconspicuous, greenish white flowers in clusters of 3-7 bloom May to early June, and (d) small, globose, pea-sized fruits which emerge green when young but ripen to yellow before splitting open in fall to reveal showy scarlet berries that persist into winter.   

This vine closely resembles American bittersweet (Celastrus scandens), but the main differences are that C. scandens has its flowers and fruits located at the branch ends, whereas C. orbiculatus has its flowers and fruits located in the leaf axils.  In addition, C. orbiculatis is much more invasive in the landscape.    

C. orbiculatus is a fast-growing vine that can easily cover, shade and outcompete other vegetation.  It can girdle and kill large trees.  Birds and other wildlife eat the berries and distribute the seed.   This vine hybridizes with the native American C. scandens to produce plants with viable seed, which suggests possible loss of genetic identity for the native species over time.Genus name comes from the Greek word kelastros for an evergreen tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin orbiculatus meaning disc-shaped.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Euonymus scale and two-marked treehoppers may cause significant damage in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Chinese bittersweet should not be planted in the eastern or midwestern U. S. because of invasive potential.     

Where appropriate, it can be an interesting addition to woodland gardens and naturalized areas.  Provides quick cover for fences, arbors, trellises, posts, walls or other structures in the landscape.  Also may be grown along the ground to camouflage rock piles or old tree stumps.

Culture
Easily grown in most soils. Best in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun. Lean soils help restrain growth. Will grow in part shade, but needs full sun for best flowering and subsequent fruit display. Prune in late winter to early spring. Mature vines require little pruning other than removal of dead or excess growth. These plants are primarily dioecious (separate male and female plants), although some have a few perfect flowers. Female plants need a male pollinator to produce the attractive fruit that is the signature of this vine. Unfortunately, some nurseries do not sell the vines as male or female (as is commonly done with hollies). Generally one male plant is needed for 6-9 female plants. Female plants may be vegetatively propagated to create more female plants. Vines may be grown on structures or allowed to ramble along the ground. It is generally best to avoid growing vines up small trees or through shrubs because vines grow rapidly and can girdle trunks and branches causing damage and sometimes death. Vines sucker at the roots to form large colonies in the wild. Vines will also self-seed, often with assistance from local bird populations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celastrus scandens, commonly called American bittersweet, is a deciduous twining woody vine that is best known for its showy red berries that brighten up fall and winter landscapes. This species is native to central and eastern North America including Missouri. In Missouri, bittersweet is typically found in woodland areas, thickets, rocky slopes, bluffs, glade peripheries and along fence rows throughout the State (Steyermark). It is often seen growing along the ground, over and through low shrubs or circling trees in the wild. Berry-laden branches are prized for use as indoor decorations, and collection of the branches in the wild has significantly reduced the wild populations in some areas. Rapidly grows to 20’. It produces serrate, elliptic to ovate, yellowish-green leaves (to 4” long). Staminate and pistillate flowers appear in clusters on separate plants in late spring. Flowers are greenish-white to yellow. Fertilized female flowers give way in summer to spherical orange-yellow fruits. Fruits split open in fall to reveal scarlet fleshy berry-like seeds (arils). Fruits are poisonous if ingested, but are considered to be quite tasty by many birds. In the 1700s, plants were given the name bittersweet by European colonists because their fruits purportedly resembled in appearance the fruits of a Eurasian nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) that was known to them as bittersweet. The common name of false bittersweet also came to be used for the within species to distinguish it from the Eurasian nightshade. American bittersweet is the generally accepted common name that is used today, in large part to distinguish this American native from its aggressive Asiatic relative, C. orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) which has escaped cultivation and is naturalizing in parts of eastern and central North America.Genus name comes from the Greek word kelastros for an evergreen tree.Specific epithet means climbing.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Euonymus scale and two-marked treehoppers may cause significant damage in some areas.

Culture
Celosia is a tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. It is grown in the St. Louis area as a warm weather annual. It is easily grown in humusy, moderately fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade and dry soils. Thrives in hot and humid St. Louis summers. Seed may be sown directly in the garden after last spring frost date. For earlier bloom, start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date. Set out seedlings or purchased plants after last frost date. Taller cultivars should be planted in locations sheltered from strong winds. Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celosia argentea var. cristata is currently divided into four different groups: (1) Plumosa Group, (2) Cristata Group, (3) Childsii Group and (4) Spicata Group. 

Plumosa Group plants (commonly called feather celosia, plumed celosia or feathered amaranth) are old garden favorites that feature narrow-pyramidal, plume-like flower heads (4-10” long) composed of tiny, densely-packed, vividly-colored flowers. Flower colors include bright shades of orange, red, purple, yellow and cream. Flowers bloom throughout summer into fall (sometimes to frost) on erect stems clad with spear-shaped green to red-purple leaves. The flower heads sometimes project an artificial, almost plastic-like appearance that, to some gardeners, may border on the gaudy. Plumosa Group cultivars range in size from dwarf to tall (8-36”). Selections include Kimono Series (to 8”) and Century Series (to 2’) plus individual cultivars of merit such as ‘Apricot Brandy’ (pale orange flowers to 20” with green-purple leaves), ‘Forest Fire’ (scarlet flowers to 24” with maroon leaves), and ‘New Look‘ (red flowers to 14” with purple-bronze leaves).Genus name comes from the Greek word keleos meaning burning for the colorful flowers.Specific epithet means having tassel-like tips or crested.New Look' is a 1988 introduction that features bright red flower plumes and purple-bronze leaves. It typically grows to 14"" tall with a spread to 12"".
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to root rot, particularly in poorly-drained soils. Fungal leaf spot diseases may also occur.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or group in beds, borders or cutting gardens. Edging. Good fresh cut or dried flower. Containers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celtis australis, commonly known as Mediterranean hackberry, European hackberry or European nettle tree, is a medium to large deciduous tree that typically grows 40-70’ tall with upright-arching branching and a rounded spreading crown.  Trunk diameter ranges from 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’).  It is native to the Mediterranean area (southern Europe, northern Africa and southwestern Asia).  Mature trees have smooth gray bark.  Rough textured, sharply-toothed, ovate-lanceolate, dark green leaves (to 5"" long) taper to long points.  Leaves are gray pubescent beneath.  Undistinguished yellow fall color.  Apetalous, unisexual or bi-sexual flowers appear in spring (April-May).  Female flowers give way to a crop of rounded, fleshy, berry-like drupes (fruits) which mature in fall to dark purple.  Fleshy parts of each drupe are edible and somewhat sweet.   Each drupe (1/4"" diameter) has one round seed within.  Drupes are attractive to a variety of wildlife.  Birds consume the drupes and disperse the seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word austral meaning southern.
","
Problems
Witches’ broom (dwarfed, dense, contorted twig clusters at the branch ends) is common in some areas.  It does no significant harm to the tree, but can produce unsightly results.  Hackberry nipple gall (disfigures leaves) is less of a problem with this species than with Celtis occidentalis.  Powdery mildew, leaf spot and root rot may occur.  Watch for lacebugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
Mediterranean hackberry is not winter hardy to the St. Louis area.  It is a tough shade tree that grows in a wide range of soils.  Cultivars resistant to witches' broom are better selections than the species for landscape use.  This tree may be used as a lawn tree or street tree.  Seeds can pose clean up problems if trees are sited near sidewalks or patios, however.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celtis laevigata, commonly called sugarberry, sugar hackberry or southern hackberry, is basically a southern version of common or northern hackberry (see C. occidentalis). Sugarberry differs from common hackberry inter alia by (1) fruits are juicier and sweeter, (2) bark is less corky, (3) leaves are narrower with mostly smooth margins, (4) better resistance to witches’ broom and (5) less winter hardiness. Sugarberry is a medium to large sized deciduous tree that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with upright-arching branching and a rounded spreading crown. Trunk diameter ranges from 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’). This tree is native to and widely distributed throughout the southeast and south central U.S. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams and floodplains mostly south of the Missouri River except for the Ozark region. (Steyermark). Mature gray bark develops a warty texture. Insignificant, mostly monoecious, greenish flowers appear in spring (April –May), with male flowers in clusters and female flowers solitary. Female flowers give way to an often abundant fruit crop of round fleshy berry-like drupes maturing to deep purple. Each drupe has one round brown seed within. Fruits are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Birds consume the fruits and disperse the seeds. Fleshy parts of the fruit are edible and sweet. Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, rough-textured, untoothed, glossy to dull green leaves (2-4” long) have mostly uneven leaf bases. Undistinguished yellow fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another tree.Specific epithet means smooth.
","
Problems
Hackberry nipple gall is so common in the St. Louis area that it is often used as an aid in identifying hackberries. Although the galls do not hurt these trees, they often significantly disfigure the leaves. Sugarberry has good resistance to witches’ broom (dwarfed, dense, contorted twig clusters at the branch ends). Powdery mildew and leaf spot may occur. Watch for lacebugs and scale.

It has been declared to be a noxious weed in parts of South Africa and along the eastern coast of Australia where it rapidly colonizes certain areas replacing native vegetation. This tree is not considered to be invasive in the U.S.‘Green Cascade’ must be asexually propagated in order to duplicate its weeping form.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celtis sinensis, commonly called Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous (infrequently semi-evergreen), fast-growing tree in the hemp family (formerly included in the elm family) that typically matures to 40-60’ tall and 35-50’ wide with a round wide-spreading crown.  It is native to slopes in eastern China, Japan and Korea.  Pointed, ovate to ovate-elliptic, round-toothed green leaves (2-5.5” long) are dark and glossy above but paler and somewhat hairy beneath with rounded to obliquely truncate bases.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Inconspicuous monoecious greenish flowers bloom from the leaf axils and stem bases in spring (March-early May).  Female flowers are followed by fruits (globose drupes to 1/3” long) which have stalks about the same length as the leaf stalks.  Immature fruits are green, but mature to orange before finally turning reddish-brown in fall.  Birds consume the drupes and disperse the seeds.  Mature trees have smooth gray to gray-brown bark.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another tree.Specific epithet means Chinese.‘Green Cascade’ is a weeping cultivar whose branches weep to the ground.  It is best trained over gates, pergolas, garden arbors or large trellises.  It has no tendrils and will not twine like a vine, so it must be attached to a support structure by tying or draping.  Unsupported plants will not grow as upright trees, but will simply spread along the ground in a mounded form (sometimes being referred to as “hackberry snakes”).  Supported trees may be trained to varying heights.  ‘Green Cascade’ was reportedly brought into the U.S. from Japan in 1983 as seed collected from a specimen tree at Suwa Jinja shrine in the village of Kamiyamaguchimura.  It is winter hardy to USDA Zones 7 (perhaps 6) -9.

Culture
Cool weather annual that is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Plant stems will droop in too much shade. Plants tolerate poor soils. Avoid wet soils. New plants may be grown each year by planting seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date or outdoors at the last spring frost date. In mild winter climates, seed may be planted outdoors in fall. Plants may reseed in the garden. Deadheading spent flower heads will limit self-seeding, but in the process removes from the garden seeds that are loved by birds. Taller plants may need staking or other support.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centaurea cyanus is an annual cornflower native to Europe that has escaped gardens and naturalized throughout much of the United States and southern Canada. In Missouri, it is typically found in fields and waste grounds and along railroads and roadsides (Steyermark). Purple-blue flowers (sometimes pink to white) bloom from late spring into summer on 1- to 3-foot tall stems clad with lyrate-pinnatifid lower leaves and narrow lanceolate upper leaves. Each flower (to 1.5” diameter) is subtended an involucre of overlapping bracts. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek word kentauros meaning centaur.Specific epithet means blue for flower color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Wilt, rots and rusts may occur. Watch for aphids and mealybugs.

Culture
Easily grown in average, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Addition of sand to the soil helps promote good drainage. Plants prefer cool summer climates and do not perform well south of USDA Zone 7. Mature plants tolerate dryish soils. Avoid wet soils. Plants may be grown from seed, and may escape gardens/naturalize by self-seeding, but are not considered invasive as is the case with some of the knapweeds. Stems may flop on taller plants. Cut flowering stems back after bloom is completed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centaurea dealbata, commonly called Persian cornflower or knapweed, is native to Iran and the Caucasus. It is a clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 24-30"" tall with a spread to 24"" wide. Pinnately-lobed basal foliage (to 18-24"" long) is dark green above with whitish hairs underneath. Cornflower-like, lavender to rosy pink flowers (2-3"" diameter), each flower having a deeply fringed ring of outer petals surrounding a center of paler inner petals, bloom from late spring to early summer atop stems clad with small, entire, sessile, upper leaves. Each flower head has distinctive involucre bracts. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek word kentauros meaning centaur.Specific epithet means whitened for covered with opaque white powder.

Culture
Easily grown in average to sandy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers slightly alkaline soils in full sun.  Limestone may be added to acidic soils.  Tolerates dry soils.  Does well in poor, infertile soils where it usually grows in a more compact form.  Freely self-seeds in optimum growing conditions to the point of being somewhat invasive and weedy.  Promptly remove (shear if large planting) spent flower stems to encourage additional bloom and to prevent seeds from forming.   Plants are generally less vigorous in the hot and humid summers of the Southeastern U.S. than in cool summer climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centranthus ruber, commonly called red valerian or Jupiter’s beard, is a well-branched, bushy, clump-forming, woody-based perennial which is valued for its ability to produce, often in poor soils, a showy bloom of star-shaped crimson, pink or white flowers from spring to frost.  Although native to the Mediterranean, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the United States, particularly along the west coast.  Flowers (each to 1/2"") appear in dense terminal clusters (cymes) atop upright to relaxed stems rising above the foliage to 1.5-3' tall.  Flowers are fragrant.  If not deadheaded, flowers give way to dandelion-like seed heads which are typically disbursed around the landscape by wind.  Fleshy, sessile, oval to lanceolate leaves (to 4"" long) are gray-green.Genus name comes from the Greek words kentron meaning a spur and anthos meaning a flower for the spurred flower.Specific epithet means red in reference to flower color of species plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Mealy bugs and aphids are occasional visitors.  Crown rot may develop in overly moist soils.  Invasive spread can be troublesome in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens.  Naturalized areas.  Stone walls.  Slope or bank cover to help combat erosion.  Borders, particularly as specimens or in small groups where planting can be more easily managed.   Effective ground cover.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where this perennial is easily grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates some part shade.  Intolerant of frost.  When grown in tropical to semi-tropical climates, it will remain in the garden as a perennial.  However, it must be grown as an annual in climates north of USDA Zone 10 because the plant will die off in fall at the time of the first frost.  For growth as an annual, plants may be grown by seed started indoors 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date, with seed transplanted outdoors after last spring frost date.  Replant seedlings in spring each year.   Plants will self-seed in the garden, sometimes aggressively in frost-free climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centratherum punctatum, commonly called Brazilian bachelor’s button, is a tender perennial that typically grows to 12-18” tall.  It is a spreading ground cover which is highlighted by a long continuous June-September bloom of fluffy, button-shaped, lavender-blue flowers (to 1” wide).  It is native to Brazil.  Perennial plants will spread in the garden to 2-4’ wide or more.  Annual plants will spread to 2’ wide.  Stems are clad with simple, coarsely-toothed, oval to elliptic, olive green to pale green leaves (each to 2-3” long) with depressed veins.  Leaves are pleasantly fragrant.Genus name come from the Greek kentron meaning a spur and antheros meaning a barb or spine.Specific epithet means spotted.‘Button Beauty’ is an improved version of the species featuring slightly larger flowers on more vigorous plants.

Culture
Easily grown in moist, humusy soils in full sun to part shade. Grows very well in wet soils, including flood conditions and shallow standing water. Adapts to a wide range of soils except dry ones. Pruning is usually not necessary, but may be done in early spring to shape. If plants become unmanageable, however, they may be cut back near to the ground in early spring to revitalize.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Genus name comes from the Greek words kephale meaning ""head"" and anthos meaning ""flower"".Buttonbush is a somewhat coarse, deciduous shrub with an open-rounded habit that typically grows 6-12’ (infrequently to 20’) tall. It is common throughout Missouri, most frequently occurring in wet open areas, low woods, thickets, swamps, upland sink-hole ponds, river bottomland and stream/pond margins (Steyermark). Tiny, tubular, 5-lobed, fragrant white flowers appear in dense, spherical, long-stalked flower heads (to 1.5” diameter) in early to mid-summer. Long, projecting styles give the flower heads a distinctively pincushion-like appearance. Flower heads are very attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other insect pollinators. Flower heads mature into hard spherical ball-like fruits consisting of multiple tiny two-seeded nutlets. Fruiting heads usually persist throughout the winter. Ovate to elliptic glossy bright green leaves (to 6” long) are in pairs or whorls. Leaves emerge late in spring.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Naturalize in woodland areas, native plant gardens, pond margins, low spots or shrub borders. May also be grown in shallow water at the edge of ponds or large water gardens.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Flowering stems tend to flop if plants are grown in anything less than full sun. Foliage generally declines as the summer progresses, particularly if soils are allowed to dry out. Deadhead spent flowers to promote additional bloom. At the end of the flowering period, cut back all flowering stems to the ground and trim back foliage as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cephalaria gigantea, commonly called giant scabious or yellow scabious, is native to moist soils from the Caucusus to Siberia. Closely related to and in the same family as scabiosas (pin cushion flowers), this vigorous plant is primarily grown for its large size, attractive young foliage and yellow flowers. It is an erect, clump-forming perennial that typically grows 4- 6’ (infrequently to 8’) tall. Scabiosa-like primrose yellow flowers (to 2.5” diameter) bloom in summer. Flowers appear singly atop stiff, wiry, branched, sparsely-leaved stems rising well above the foliage mound to 6’ tall. Pinnately-divided, dark green, basal leaves (to 16” long) with oblong to lance-shaped segments. Synonymous with C. tartarica. Also commonly called Tartarian cephalaria.Genus name comes from the Greek word kephale meaning a head for the flower head.Specific epithet means unusually tall or large.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Taller plants may need some staking or support.
","
Garden Uses
This plant needs a large space. Border rears or cottage gardens. Naturalize in wildflower meadows or wild areas.

Culture
Best grown in moist, sandy, well-drained soils in shady areas of the landscape. Tolerates shady conditions better than most needled evergreens. Tolerates full sun in cool summers, but prefers part shade conditions in areas with hot summers. Plants have good heat tolerance. Established plants tolerate some drought. Plants are not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they should be planted in protected locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cephalotaxus harringtonia, commonly called plum yew, is a dioecious coniferous evergreen that typically grows as a shrub to 5-10’ tall, but may be trained as a tree that could eventually rise to as much as 20-30’ tall. Growth is slow, however, and it often takes as much as 10 years for a plant to reach 4’ tall.  It is native to shaded woodland areas in Japan, northeastern China and Korea.  Linear, spirally-arranged, yew-like, evergreen leaves (to 1.5” long) appear in a v-shaped pattern on erect stems, many of which rise up from the base of the plant.  Female flowers produce fleshy, edible, plum-like fruits (to 1"" long).  If fruits are desired, female plants with at least one male pollinator are required for fruit production to occur.  Excellent tolerance for both shade and hot weather make this species an interesting substitute in the southeastern U.S. for true yews (Taxus) that usually struggle south of USDA Zone 7.The genus name Cephalotaxus comes from the Greek words kephale meaning ""head"" and Taxus meaning ""yew"" for its resemblance to yews (Genus Taxus).Specific epithet honors the Earl of Harrington who became an early enthusiast for the species after its introduction to Europe in the 1820s.Plants are commonly called plum yews because the fruits on female plants resemble tiny plums and the foliage resembles that of yews (Taxus).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Accent, group or mass. Excellent evergreen conifer for shady locations in the landscape.

Culture
Best grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a somewhat wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones which inevitably lead to root rot.  Grows well in cool summer climates.  Intolerant of the high summer heat and humidity of the deep South.  Plants will easily self-seed in the garden.  Best to shear off flower stems after bloom in order to prevent self-seeding, reduce future foliage decline, and shape/neaten the foliage mat.  Divide every year if needed to help maintain compact size.  Starter plants may be planted 9-12” apart to quickly cover large areas.  

As is the case with many of the different species of chickweeds, this plant has the potential to spread rapidly in the landscape, particularly after invading lawn grass areas, to the point where many gardeners consider it to be more of a troublesome weed than a valued flowering perennial.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cerastium arvense, commonly known as field chickweed, meadow chickweed or field mouse-ear, is a multi-stemmed herbaceous perennial.  It grows in a variety of different forms, ranging from (1) strongly rhizomatous (taproot absent), long-creeping, mat-forming plants to (2) tap-rooted (sometimes shortly rhizomatous), clumping, and more upright plants.  Height ranges from 2-18” tall.  Field chickweed is endemic to North America, Europe and some areas of South America.  It typically thrives in open sunny habitats at elevations ranging from sea level to 12,000 feet.  Common growing habitats include rocky alpine areas, valleys, meadows, fields, plains, grassy areas, and, in particular, human disturbed areas such as lawns and roadsides.  Many subspecies of this plant have been identified, but experts are in disagreement as to how many of those subspecies should be recognized given its worldwide distribution, highly variable plant form and diversity of habitat.  It is sometimes difficult to distinguish this plant in the wild from similar species of chickweed.  

Field chickweed is an upright tap-rooted plant that typically forms a foliage mound to 8” tall, with flowering stems rising well above the foliage in spring to 14-18” tall carrying clusters (cymes) of white flowers.  It is a rhizomatous plant that produces lengthy creeping shoots which often form densely matted colonies.  Plants are usually somewhat hairy in texture.  Linear to lance-shaped to oblong leaves are 1” long and 1/4” wide.   Each open inflorescence typically has 3-5 flowers, with each flower (1/2” to 3/4” wide) having five 2-lobed petals and five green sepals.  Flowers bloom April-August.  Fruit is a seeded capsule to 5/8” long.Genus name comes from the Greek word keras meaning horn in reference to the seed capsule which in some species is bent slightly like a cow’s horn.Specific epithet means growing in or pertaining to cultivated fields.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Damping off may occur in climates with high humidity or locations with too much shade.  Root rot can be a serious problem if plants are grown in poorly-drained soils or in soils that remain wet.  Often becomes a troublesome difficult-to-control lawn weed which can spread easily in the landscape.
","
Garden Uses
Ground cover for informal sunny areas.  Cottage gardens, edgings, or bulb cover.  Small areas of rock gardens.

Culture
Best grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a somewhat wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones which inevitably lead to root rot.  Grows well in cool summer climates.  Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 2.  Intolerant of the high summer heat and humidity of the deep South.  Spreads by runners to fill in areas, but is not considered to be invasive in the hot St. Louis climate where it is less robust than in cooler northern climates.  Plants will self-seed in the garden if spent blooms are not removed.  Best to shear off flower stems after bloom in order to prevent self-seeding, reduce future foliage decline,  and shape/neaten the foliage mat.  Large beds can be mowed on a high setting.  Divide every year if needed to help maintain compact size of the mat.  Starter plants may be planted 9-12” apart to quickly cover large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cerastium tomentosum, known as snow-in-summer, is a short-lived, low-growing, mat-forming perennial which is typically massed in sunny locations as a ground cover.  Tufts of narrow, gray-green leaves (each to 1"" long and 1/4"" wide) form a 6” tall foliage mat.  Leaves are evergreen.  In late spring, flower stems rise above the foliage mat (typically to 8-12”) carrying clusters (cymes) of white blooms which form a snow-like carpet (hence the common name).  Flowers (to 1” diameter) have 5 notched petals and are similar in appearance and closely related to several of the chickweeds.  Less invasive, more compact cultivars of this species usually make better garden plants.Genus name comes from the Greek word keras meaning horn in reference to the seed capsule which in some species is bent slightly like a cow’s horn.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's woolly white leaves and stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Damping off may occur in climates with high humidity or locations with too much shade.  Root rot can be a serious problem if plants are grown in poorly-drained soils or in soils that remain wet.  Plants are short-lived, and dead patches often begin to appear after several years.  In St. Louis, foliage usually declines as the summer progresses.
","
Garden Uses
Ground cover for sunny areas.  Rock gardens, border fronts, cottage gardens, edgings, bulb cover or dry stone wall planting pockets.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Somewhat wide range of soil tolerance except for wet, poorly-drained ones. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as St. Louis. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where it will benefit from a light winter mulch. Spreads by rhizomes and can be somewhat aggressive in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ceratostigma plumbaginoides, commonly called plumbago or leadwort, is a wiry, mat-forming perennial which spreads by rhizomes to form an attractive ground cover. Typically grows 6-10"" tall on generally erect stems rising from the rhizomes. Oval to obovate, shiny, medium green leaves (to 2"" long) turn bronze-red in autumn. Terminal clusters of 5-petaled, gentian blue flowers (1/2 to 3/4"" diameter) appear above the foliage over a long summer to frost bloom period. Flowers resemble those of woodland phlox.Genus name comes from the Greek words keras meaning a horn and stigma from the hornlike projection on the stigma of the flower.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Plumbago.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Will spread.
","
Garden Uses
Late, long-flowering plant serves as excellent ground cover for sunny to partly shaded areas in the landscape. A good plant for interplanting with spring bulbs because foliage emerges late as the bulb foliage is dying back. Underplanting for shrubs. Edger. May be used in rock gardens or border fronts with careful monitoring of spread. As a ground cover, plumbago would probably be as extensively planted as vinca, pachysandra or English ivy, except for the fact that it lacks their evergreen foliage.

Best grown in rich, moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates full sun, but has little tolerance for drought particularly when young.  Best sited in a location protected from strong winds and hot afternoon sun.  This is a dioecious tree (male and female flowers on separate trees).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cercidiphyllum japonicum, commonly called katsura tree, is native to Japan and China.  It is a deciduous, single or multi-trunked, understory tree with a dense, rounded habit that typically matures to 40-60’ tall in cultivation, but can reach 100’ or more in the wild.  It is grown for its beautiful shape and its attractive foliage.  Cordate, round-oval leaves (to 4” long) resemble those of a small redbud (Cercis is the redbud genus and phyllon is Greek for leaf).  Leaves emerge reddish purple in spring, mature to medium green with a slight bluish tinge in summer and turn quality shades of gold, orange and red in fall.  Although not aromatic, the fallen autumn leaves have been varyingly described as smelling of cinnamon, burnt sugar or ripe apples.  Tiny flowers (red on male trees and green on female trees) appear in spring before the foliage but are not particularly showy.  Pollinated flowers on female trees are followed by clusters of greenish pods (to 3/4” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words kerkis meaning redbud or Judas tree and phyllon meaning a leaf for its appearance to redbud (Cercis.)Specific epithet means of Japan.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage may scorch in hot, dry and/or windy conditions.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cercis canadensis, commonly called eastern redbud, is a deciduous, often multi-trunked understory tree with a rounded crown that typically matures to 20-30’ tall with a slightly larger spread.  It is particularly noted for its stunning pea-like rose-purple flowers which bloom profusely on bare branches in early spring (March-April) before the foliage emerges.  This tree is native to eastern and central North America from Connecticut to New York to southern Ontario and the Great Lakes south to Western Texas and Florida.  It is found in open woodlands, thickets, woodland margins, limestone glades and along rocky streams and bluffs throughout Missouri (Steyermark).  Flowers (to ½” wide) bloom in clusters of 4-10.  Flowers are followed by flattened leguminous bean-like dry seedpods (to 2-4” long) that mature to brown in summer. Each pod has 6-12 seeds.  Pods may remain on the tree into winter.  Alternate, simple, cordate, broadly ovate to nearly orbicular, dull green to blue-green leaves (3-5” across) have a papery texture and are short pointed at the tip.  Leaves turn pale yellow to greenish-yellow in fall.  Cercis canadensis is the state tree of Oklahoma.Genus name comes from the Greek word kerkis meaning weaver’s shuttle in reference to the resemblance of each seed pod to a weaver’s shuttle.Specific epithet is in reference to Canada (southern Ontario) being part of the native range of this tree.
","
Problems
Canker can be a significant disease problem.  Verticillium wilt, dieback, leaf spots, mildew and blights may also occur.  Insect pests include Japanese beetles, tree hoppers, leaf hoppers, caterpillars, borers, webworms and scale.  Keeping the tree vigorous by regular watering and fertilization and by pruning out dead branches as needed will help keep the tree healthy.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cercis siliquastrum, commonly called Judas tree or Mediterranean redbud or love tree, is a deciduous, often multi-trunked, understory tree with a rounded crown that typically matures to 15-25’ tall and as wide.   This tree is native to woodlands in the Mediterranean region extending from southern Europe to western Asia.  It is particularly noted for its stunning pea-like rose-purple or purplish-pink flowers which bloom profusely on bare branches in early spring (March-April) before the foliage emerges.  Flowers (each to 3/4” long) bloom in clusters of 3 to 6 on the older growth, typically covering the branches and stems but sometimes also growing from the trunk of the tree.  Flowers are larger than those found on most other Cercis species trees.  Nearly orbicular heart-shaped leaves (to 3-5” long) emerge bronze red in spring, mature to deep green by summer and finally turn pale yellow to greenish-yellow to chestnut in fall.  Rounded leaves lack the distinctive short-pointed tips found on the leaves of C. canadensis.  Flowers are followed by ornamentally showy, pendant, leguminous, flattened, purple seed pods (each to 4” long) which mature by late summer but usually remain on the tree well into winter.Genus name comes from the Greek word kerkis meaning weaver’s shuttle in reference to the resemblance of each seed pod to a weaver’s shuttle.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word siliqua meaning pod and the suffix –astrum meaning partial resemblance.Common name of Judas tree is in reference to the claim that Judas Iscariot reportedly hung himself from a Cercis siliquastrum tree.   Common name of Mediterranean redbud is in regard to the native territory of this tree.  Common name of love tree is in reference to the heart-shaped (cordate) leaves of this tree.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cercocarpus montanus is a woody shrub which grows up to 12' tall. It vase-like shape and silvery seed plumes are perhaps its most outstanding features.  Early summer flowers are insignificant, but give way to fruits (hard nutlets) with long, attractive, silvery-white, feathery tails which cover the shrub in late summer. Commonly called mountain mahogany because the bark is a red mahogany color. Green foliage turns russet in the fall. A native American shrub or small tree which grows in certain dry, chaparral, foothill and lower mountain regions of the West (central Rockies and Sierras from California to Washington).Genus name comes from the Greek words kerkos meaning a tail and karpos meaning a fruit for the fruit's ""tail"".Specific epithet means pertaining to mountains.
","
Problems
No serious problems.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to dry moisture, well-draining soils in full sun to part shade. Can tolerate occasional dry soil conditions. Add organic matter to loosen heavier soils. Fast growth rate. Best flowering with regular moisture during hot, dry weather and plenty of fertilizer during growing periods. Hardy from Zones 8-11. Depending on the climatic conditions, this plant can be grown as an evergreen shrub, deciduous shrub, a more tender, semi-woody perennial, or an annual.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cestrum elegans, commonly called purple cestrum, is a climbing shrub-like perennial native to southern Mexico. Its arching stems are covered in fine, dense hairs, and can reach 6-10' in height with an equal spread. Leaves are elliptic in shape, with a pointed end and fine hairs along the margins. The red to violet tubular flowers (1.5"" long) form in terminal clusters and are attractive to hummingbirds. Blooms are nearly continuous in warmer climates, though the peak is in spring and summer. The flowers are followed by red berries. This plant has been known to escape cultivation where hardy, and in some areas has become a pest species in forest margins and disturbed sites.Genus name is from the Greek name for the plant.The specific epithet elegans means elegant.
","
Problems
No major pest or disease problems reported.
","
Garden Uses
This plant has a tendency to overtake a garden area if given good growing conditions and not properly managed. Can be trained to climb an arbor or trellis. Heavy pruning is recommended for smaller garden areas and more formal landscapes. Where not hardy, use as an annual in a bird garden or to add tropical interest to a mixed border.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best flowering occurs in full sun. Adapts to a wide range of soil conditions, but prefers well-drained loams. Established plants tolerate some dry soils. Plants bloom on old growth. Avoid heavy pruning. Prune to shape as needed in spring after flowering to stimulate growth of flowering spurs which will improve bloom for the following year (although such pruning will reduce fruit production for the current year). Promptly remove root suckers to control possible spread.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chaenomeles japonica, commonly called Japanese quince, is a low-growing, densely-branched, deciduous shrub with spiny, often-tangled, gray-brown twigs. It typically grows to 3’ tall but spreads to 6' wide. Five-petaled, orange-scarlet flowers (to 1.5” across) with creamy white stamens bloom before the leaves unfold in an often showy early spring floral display. Flowers are followed by hard, greenish-yellow fruits (1.5” pomes that are commonly called quinces) which ripen in early autumn. Ripe quinces are fragrant. Quinces are edible, but usually are considered too bitter to be eaten directly from the shrub. Quinces are sometimes used to make preserves and jellies. Coarsely-toothed, broad-oval, green leaves (to 2” long). No appreciable fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek words chaino meaning to gape and melon meaning an apple in the incorrect belief that the fruits split open.Specific epithet means Japanese.
","
Problems
Susceptible to fungal leaf spot (particularly in years with heavy spring rainfall) which can cause considerable leaf defoliation. Fireblight and scab can be problems in some areas. Aphids can cause significant damage to new growth. Lesser pests include scale and mites. Chlorosis (yellowing of foliage) will occur in high pH soils. Flower buds are susceptible to significant damage from early spring frosts.
","
Garden Uses
Low hedge. Specimen or group in shrub border or cottage garden. Shrubs may also be trained against a wall. Branches may be clipped and forced for winter bloom.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Chaenomeles speciosa, commonly called flowering quince, is a dense, broad-rounded, deciduous shrub with often-tangled, spiny, gray-brown twigs.  It typically grows to 6-10’ tall and as wide.  It is native to China, Tibet and Myanmar (Burma).  Scarlet to red (less frequently pink or white) five-petaled flowers (to 2” diameter) bloom before the leaves fully unfold in an often showy early spring bloom (late March - April).  Flowers are followed by hard, dot-speckled, edible, yellowish-green fruits (2.5” quinces) that are rather bitter when eaten fresh from the shrub, but quite tasty in preserves and jellies.  Finely-toothed, oval to oblong, glossy dark green leaves (to 3.5” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words chaino meaning to gape and melon meaning an apple in the incorrect belief that the fruits split open.Specific epithet means showy.

Culture
Showy annual wild flower that is easily grown from seed in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Favors somewhat poor soils because of reduced competition from other plants.  Spreads invasively by self-seeding, particularly in dry open areas.  Plant seeds late March to May.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaecrista fasciculate, commonly known by a large number of common names including partridge pea, prairie senna, golden cassia, large-flowered sensitive pea, sleeping plant, and locust weed, is a showy annual flower in the legume family that typically grows to 1-3’ tall.  Shorter plants stand erect, but taller plants tend to sprawl.  It is native to a variety of habitats including rocky open woods, upland slopes, ridges, bluffs, prairies, grasslands, rocky fields and open thickets in the eastern, mid-western and Great Plains sections of the U. S. from Massachusetts to South Dakota south to New Mexico and Florida.  

Large, showy, yellow flowers (to 1” across) bloom from the upper leaf axils in short clusters (each to 2-6 flowers) from late June to September.  Each flower has 5 rounded yellow petals and 10 stamens (6 red and 4 yellow).  Flowers are borne on stems clad with alternate, pinnate-compound leaves, each leaf having 8-18 pairs of small, narrow, linear-oblong 2/3-inch long leaflets.  Leaves will usually fold together (collapse) when touched giving rise to the common name of sensitive pea.  Leaves are also sensitive to daylight, folding their leaflets in late afternoon each day as darkness approaches.  Flowers give way to narrow, flattened, dehiscent seed pods (each to 2 1/2” long).  Each pod is initially green but matures to brown before splitting open on both sides in fall to explosively expel the seeds within.  Seeds are regularly consumed by birds.  Plants provide cover for game birds and browse for deer.  Flowers are a good nectar source for bees and butterflies.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Cassia chamaecrista and Cassia fasciculate.Genus name come from the Greek words chamae meaning low growth and crista meaning crested.Specific epithet means banded or bundled nerve fibers in reference to the sensitivity of the leaflets.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Mildew and leaf spot may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Popular long-flowering ornamental annual that is perfect for a naturalized setting or meadow where it can freely spread.  Native gardens.  Sometimes planted for erosion control to stabilize banks.  Improves soil fertility (fixes nitrogen).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, commonly known as Lawson's cypress, is a tall, narrow-pyramidal, scaly-leaved, evergreen conifer with short spreading branches and flattened twigs.  It is the tallest member of the cypress family.  In its native habitat, it will grow over time to 110-175' (sometimes to 200' or more) tall and to 4-6' in diameter,  but usually much shorter (to 40-60' tall) in cultivation.  This tree has a very small native range; primarily being found on seaward slopes in a coastal belt along Pacific Coast mountain ranges from Coos Bay in southwestern Oregon to the Klamath River in northwestern California, with isolated additional populations in northern California near the Trinity Mountains and Mount Shasta.   It sometimes grows in pure stands, but also is found growing with western red cedar, grand fir, western hemlock and Sikta spruce.  Tiny, scale-like, bright green to blue green leaves (to 1/16"" long) with silver marks beneath are pressed against the branchlets.  Spherical female cones (1/4 to 3/8"" diameter) are green maturing to brown.  Oblong male cones are smaller, reddish-brown and oblong.  Thick, silvery-brown to reddish-brown bark is furrowed and ridged.  Wood is hard and durable.  Although the supply is limited, lumber from this tree is in great demand.  Charles Lawson (1794-1873) was a Scottish nurseryman.  

Another common name for this tree is Port Orford cedar (unfortunately misleading because this is not a cedar) in recognition of the discovery of this tree in 1854 near the area now occupied by the town of Port Orford, Oregon.Genus name comes from Greek chamai meaning dwarf or to the ground and kyparissos meaning cypress tree.
","
Problems
Phytophthora lateralis is a fungus which has spread through the native range of this tree at a rapid rate.  It causes an often-fatal root rot disease which poses a significant threat to the survival of the species.
","
Garden Uses
Huge tree that is infrequently grown in landscapes.  A large number of compact to dwarf cultivars of this species are available in commerce for ornamental plantings.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaedaphne calyculata, commonly known as leatherleaf, is a rhizomatous broadleaf evergreen shrub that is native to wet soils in bogs, fens, pond peripheries and meadows in the cooler areas of North America, Europe and Asia. In the U. S., it is found in Alaska and from Minnesota to Maine south to Illinois and Georgia. It typically grows to 1-3’ tall and as wide, and is noted for its glossy green foliage and white spring flowers. Short-stalked, urn-shaped white flowers in small-leaved, one-sided, terminal racemes (to 5” long) bloom in spring (April-May). Fruits are flattened five-chambered capsules. Elliptic to oblong evergreen leaves (to 2” long) have slightly rolled margins that are finely toothed or smooth, with distinctive white or rusty brown scales present on the leaf undersides.Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning on the ground or dwarf and daphne meaning laurel.‘Verdant’ was discovered in the New Jersey Pine Barrens in 1985 and subsequently introduced into commerce in the 1990s. This cultivar was selected for the improved quality of its evergreen foliage in winter (verdant meaning green).

Chamaedorea elegans, commonly called parlor palm or neanthe bella palm, is a small, compact, usually single-trunked palm that is native to rainforests from southeastern Mexico to northern Guatemala.  Where winter hardy, it will rise to 5-6' tall in shady areas of the landscape.  As a houseplant, this palm usually grows to 4' tall and is particularly noted for its dense, attractive foliage, compact shape and easy maintenance.  Handsome, arching, green pinnate leaves, with 12 or more pairs of narrow leaflets per leaf, lend a tropical flair to indoor locations.  Clusters of yellow flowers in loose spirals may bloom in spring if enough light is present.  Plants are dioecious.  Black fruit is attractive when it appears.Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning on the ground and dorea meaning a gift as the fruits are easily reached from the ground.Specific epithet means elegant.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, moist, acidic, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers good fertility. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. May be grown from seed. Best propagation is by division of the rhizome. Will naturalize in the garden over time. Plants with small rhizomes may not initially produce flowering stalks.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaelirium luteum, commonly called fairy wand, is native to moist, acidic soils in shaded areas of meadows, woods and thickets in eastern North America. It is a dioecious plant with a short-rhizome that typically grows 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall and features a basal rosette of foliage and a central flowering stalk. Male plants grow up to 2.5’ tall, but female plants may grow as tall as 4’. Tiny flowers in spike-like terminal racemes appear in June. Flowers on the male plant grow in dense, arching, plume-like spikes (to 9” long). Flowers on the female plants are in smaller erect spikes. Female plants produce seed in 3-valved, ellipsoid capsules. The dark green basal leaves (to 8” long) are smooth and spoon-shaped, but the stem leaves are much shorter and narrower. This plant has a number of additional common names including false unicorn root, devil’s bit, blazing star, starwort, rattlesnake-root, squirrel tails and helonias. Plants have become rare in many parts of the original geographic range, and should never be dug from the wild.Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning dwarf and lirion meaning a lily.Specific epithet means yellow.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for slugs and snails.
","
Garden Uses
Group or mass in woodland and/or wildflower gardens. Also appropriate for native plant gardens, cottage gardens or borders. Will naturalize in optimum growing conditions.

Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in well-drained sandy soils. Tolerates some drought. Easily grown from seed. Spreads by creeping stems that root as they go. Can be aggressive in optimum growing conditions. Best in cool summer climates. If grown as a lawn substitute, plant seedlings or divisions 6-12” apart. It can be regularly mowed as a lawn, but tolerates only minimal foot traffic.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaemelum nobile, commonly called chamomile or Roman chamomile, is a low-growing evergreen perennial that forms a spreading mat of aromatic foliage typically growing 3-6” tall and spreading by decumbent stems to 12” wide. Daisy-like flowers with white rays and yellow centers bloom throughout the summer and into early fall. Finely-dissected, fern-like foliage emits a fruity scent when bruised. Flower heads may be dried to make chamomile tea, a soothing herbal tea that has been an historic folk medicine remedy for a variety of ailments including headache, colds, flu, stomach disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. Synonymous with and formerly known as Anthemis nobilis. German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) is a taller plant with similar flowers that also makes a flavorful herbal tea. The name chamomile comes from Greek meaning “apple on the ground” in reference to the plant’s apple-like aroma.Specific epithet means notable or excellent.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8b-11.  Better winter hardiness than most other palms (tolerates brief temperature dips to 15-20 degrees F. in winter).  Easily grown in rich, moist, well-drained soils.  Best growth occurs in Mediterranean-type climates.  Prefers a bright sunny location, but tolerates part shade.  Loses compact shape in too much shade.  Best with consistent moisture, but has some drought tolerance once established.  Avoid overly moist soils.  This palm is often propagated by seed.  Dividing clumps or removing suckers can be difficult.  Specimens purchased in pots from nurseries are often reasonably priced.  In colder areas where plants are not winter hardy, they may be grown in containers which can be brought indoors and overwintered in cool, bright sunny locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaerops humilis, commonly known as Mediterranean fan palm or European fan palm, is a single- to multiple-trunked  evergreen palm with an upright irregular form that typically matures as a shrub or small tree growing to 6-15’ tall with a spread to 6-20’ wide.  It often suckers from the base of the main trunk to form a clump of 8-10 trunks, but it can be easily trained to grow with a single trunk by regularly removing the suckers.  It is the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world, and the only palm that is native to Europe.  Notwithstanding its outdoor growth potential, it typically matures to only 5’ tall when grown indoors in containers.  It is native to rocky hills and mountains of the western Mediterranean Basin from Africa’s Atlas Mountains in Morocco, Algeria and Tunesia to Spain, Portugal, France and Italy.    

Huge, distinctive, triangular, fine-textured, palmate-compound leaves are ornamentally attractive.  Each leaf (to 24” long and as wide) has 10-20 narrow, finger-like, deeply divided leaflets which are arranged in the shape of a fan at the end of a spiny petiole (leaf stalk to 3-4’ long), hence the common name of fan palm.  Leaves are variable in both color (light blue green to silver green) and shape (shrub to small tree).  Bright yellow flowers bloom in spring, but are typically hidden from view behind the leaf stems.  Flowers are followed by dark yellow, orange or brown fruits that ripen in fall.  Flowers and fruits are somewhat inconspicuous and not showy.  Trunks on mature palms are covered with a dark mat of fibers and old leaf bases.

Var. humilis includes the type strain of the species.Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning dwarf and rhops meaning a bush.Specific epithet from Latin means low-growing.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for mealy bugs, scale and spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
Beautiful specimen plant.  Unpruned, it grows in a nice shrubby form.  Pruned (suckers removed), it will grow in single trunk tree form.  Barrier.  Group accent for corner of the landscape.  Containers for patio, deck or foundation areas.  May be grown indoors as a houseplant.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade.  Prefers part shade in hot summer climates.  Needs regular moisture.  Promptly remove spent flower stems to encourage additional bloom and to prevent unwanted self-seeding.  Plants spread by both rhizomes and self-seeding (seeds have silky seed hairs which facilitate easy dispersal by the wind to remote areas).  This plant can be both persistent and aggressive in garden areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamerion angustifolium, commonly known as fireweed, is a robust strongly-spreading, rhizomatous perennial wildflower that grows to 2-5’ tall on upright, often reddish, primarily unbranched, stiff woody stems clad with alternate, narrow-lanceolate or linear, pinnately-veined, willow-like leaves (to 2-6” long and 3/4” wide) and topped by an elongated terminal cluster (raceme to 3-8” long) of open, saucer-shaped, 4-petaled,  bright pink to lilac-purple (rarely white) outward-facing flowers with protruding stigmas which bloom in summer (June-September).  Flowers bloom bottom to top on each raceme which can simultaneously have seed pods at the bottom, blooming flowers in the middle and unopened flower buds at the top.  Flowers are usually ornamentally stunning in bloom.  This plant is circumpolar, being native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere.  In North America, it is found in a variety of locations including open woods, roadsides, open fields, pastures, prairies, hills, damp ravines, logged and burned areas, and especially along streams, in damp places and on disturbed sites from low valleys to tree line in the mountains.  It is native to Alaska, all Canadian provinces and territories, and in a wide distribution in the northern U. S. states dipping southward in the Appalachian Mountains to Georgia and in the Rocky Mountains to Colorado and in the Sierra Mountains to California.  It is absent from the hot and humid southeastern U.S. and Texas.  

This fireweed was originally known by the synonymous name of Epilobium angustifolium, but was transferred from Epilobium to the genus Chamerion because of certain major differences:  (a) absence of a floral tube, (b) flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, (c) stamens are subequal, and (d) leaves are spirally arranged (alternate).Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning dwarf and nerion meaning oleander in reference to the resemblance of plant leaves to those of oleander.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words angustus meaning narrow and folium meaning leaf.Common name is in reference of the often sudden appearance of plant seedlings in areas previously devastated by wild fires or volcanos.  By way of example, one year after Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980 in Washington State, 81% of the seedlings present were from fireweed.  

In Great Britain, this fireweed acquired the common name of bombweed during WWII because of its ability to rapidly colonize bomb craters.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of poor soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils. One of the more shade tolerant of the ornamental grasses. Self-seeds and may spread aggressively. Leaving foliage in place over winter adds interest to the landscape and helps protect crowns from the cold. Cut back to the ground in early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chasmanthium latifolium, a clump-forming, upright, ornamental grass, is a Missouri native plant which typically grows 2-5' and most often occurs in rich woods or rocky slopes along streams and on moist bluffs. This grass is perhaps most distinguished by the flat, drooping seed heads which hang in terminal clusters on thread-like pedicils from slightly arching stems. Seed heads will flutter when caressed by even the softest of breezes. Seed heads emerge green but turn purplish bronze by late summer. Bright green leaves (5-9"" long) turn a coppery color after frost and eventually brown by winter. Excellent for dried flower arrangements. Common name of inland sea oats is in reference to the similarity of the seed heads to those of oats. This grass was once known as Uniola latifolia.Genus name comes from the Greek chasme meaning gaping and anthemum meaning flower for the form of the flower.Specific epithet means broad-leaved.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. May need staking or other support.
","
Garden Uses
Provides excellent contrast and texture almost year-round to the border, shaded garden, native plant garden, naturalized area, along streams or on the periphery of the water garden. Naturalize or use as specimens or accents.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist but not wet soils. Will also grow in full sun, particularly in cool summer climates. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor ones. Usually self-seeds aggressively in the garden to the point where, once established, it can be difficult to eliminate. Plants have escaped gardens and naturalized in the eastern U. S. Plants may be grown from seed and are best propagated by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chelidonium majus is native to rocky slopes, woodlands, waste areas and along roads in Europe and western Asia. Commonly called greater celandine, it is a short-lived perennial or biennial in the poppy family that bears yellow flowers and gray-green leaves. It will aggressively self-seed to the point of being weedy. Plants have in fact escaped gardens and naturalized in a number of areas in North America including Quebec, Ontario, much of the eastern and upper midwestern U.S. plus several areas in the Pacific northwest. Plants typically grow in a clump to 12-24” tall. Loose umbels of 4-petaled, 1-inch wide, yellow flowers bloom May to August. Flowers are followed by smooth, slender seed capsules (to 2” long) that split open when ripe to release tiny seeds. Lobed to deeply pinnatifid gray-green leaves (5-10” long) appear on brittle stems. Bruised or broken stems exude an acrid orange-yellow sap that is allergenic (e.g., often irritates human skin). Although all parts of this plant are toxic to humans, the plant has a long history of herbal/medicinal usage. It was once believed to be an effective remedy for wart removal, resulting in the acquisition of common names such as wartweed and swallowwart. Greater celandine is in the same family as but is significantly different in appearance from the Missouri native celandine poppy (Stylophorum diphyllum) whose yellow flowers are twice the size. Lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria) is another aggressive yellow-flowered spreader from Europe and Asia, but it is in a different family (Ranunculaceae) than greater celandine.Genus name comes from the Greek word chelidon meaning a swallow as it flowered when the swallows arrived.Specific epithet means bigger or larger.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Naturalize in woodland, wild gardens or other areas where plant spread will not be a concern.

Culture
Best grown in moist to wet, rich, humusy soils in part shade. Appreciates a good composted leaf mulch, particularly in sunny areas. Consider pinching back the stem ends in spring to reduce mature plant height, especially if growing plants in strongly shaded areas where they are more likely to need some support. In optimum environments, however, staking is usually not required. Slowly spreads by rhizomes.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chelone glabra, commonly called turtlehead, is a stiffly erect, clump-forming, leafy-stemmed, Missouri native perennial which typically grows 2-3' tall and occurs in moist woods, swampy areas and along streams mostly in the southeastern part of the State. Hooded, snapdragon-like, two-lipped, white flowers with a tinge of pink appear in tight, spike-like terminal racemes from late summer into autumn. Flowers purportedly resemble turtle heads. Coarsely-toothed, lance-shaped, dark green leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek word chelone meaning tortoise in reference to the turtlehead shape of the flowers.Specific epithet means without hairs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to mildew, particularly if soils are kept on the dry side and/or air circulation is poor. If grown in too much shade, plants may need some support.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Chelone lyonii, commonly called turtlehead, pink turtlehead or Lyon’s turtlehead, is an upright, clump-forming, rhizomatous perennial in the figwort family which typically grows 2-4’ tall on stiff, square stems.  It is native to wet woodland areas and streams in the southern Appalachian Mountains from Virginia to South Carolina and west to Tennessee, northern Mississippi and northern Alabama.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of New England and New York.  Hooded , snapdragon-like, two-lipped, pink flowers (to 1” long) bloom in tight, spike-like terminal racemes from late summer into fall (late July to September).  Flowers have puffy pink corollas with lower lips bearded with yellow hairs.  Flowers purportedly resemble the heads of open-mouthed turtles, hence the common name.  Ovate, coarsely-toothed green leaves (to 3-6” long) have slender petioles, rounded bases and pointed tips.Genus name comes from the Greek word chelone meaning tortoise in reference to the turtlehead shape of the flowers.Specific epithet honors John Lyon (1765-1814), American botanist, who was an early explorer of the southern Appalachians.

Culture
Best grown in cool, dry, upland conditions in dry to medium well-drained soils in full sun.  May not produce seed if temperatures are too hot.  In its native territory in the Andes Mountains, this plant is most commonly found growing at elevations of 8,000’ to 13,000’.  Generally thrives in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in cool summer climates.  Tolerant of marginal soils.  This plant is generally lacking in ornamental interest.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chenopodium quinoa, commonly known as quinoa, is an herbaceous annual of the goosefoot family that is native to the Andes Mountains in South America (Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina).  It is a somewhat weedy plant that typically matures in the wild to 3-6’ tall.  Although its spinach-like leaves are sometimes eaten as a raw or cooked leaf vegetable or added to various food dishes as an herb flavoring, this plant is primarily grown today as a grain crop for harvest in fall of its tiny edible seeds which are often cooked (boiled) in somewhat the same manner as rice or ground up as flour.   Quinoa is classified as a pseudocereal rather than a cereal because it is not a true grass.  As a grain, it has a somewhat dull to nutty flavor.  

Quinoa leaves are medium green, alternate, broad, generally pubescent, smooth to lobed, and lanceolate to triangular.  Young leaves may be steamed or sautéed.  Tiny, greenish, apetalous flowers bloom in summer in terminal and axillary racemes. Quinoa seeds mature in fall in indehiscent fruits (achenes).  Fruits, depending on the cultivar or variety, often develop interesting colors ranging from white to red to black.  

Quinona is a nutrient-rich food.  Seeds have respectable nutritional values, and have been an important part of the diet of Andean residents for at least the past 4,000 years.  Seeds are a plant source for complete protein.  Seeds also have respectable amounts of iron, calcium and phosphorus.  Leaves are a rich source of potassium, niacin and pantothenic acid.  

Popularity of this species is on the rise.  It is now grown in a number of countries around the world, including the U.S., Canada, Italy, Sweden and India, but continues to be most commonly found in the Andean Mountain areas of Peru and Bolivia.  In North America, it is currently cultivated as a seed crop in western Canada, Pacific northwestern states and other northern mountain states.  It was introduced into the dry alpine desert conditions (average elevation of 7,500’) of southern Colorado’s San Luis Valley (home of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and origin of the Rio Grande River) in 1982.  

The United Nations General Assembly declared 2013 as the International year of Quinoa in recognitions of the historical practices of the Andean people who have preserved this plant as a human food.Genus name comes from the Greek chen meaning a goose and podion meaning a little foot in reference to the goosefoot shape of some plant leaves.Specific epithet comes from the Incan word quinua meaning “mother grain” or the Spanish spelling of the name Kinwa.

Culture
Easily grown in dry to medium moisture, slightly alkaline, well-draining soils in full sun. Once established, will tolerate drier soils and drought conditions if occasional supplemental water is provided in summer. Prune as needed when the tree is dormant from late winter into early spring. Hardy in Zones 7-9.LUCRETIA HAMILTON is known to be more cold hardy than the species. Can be grown in Zone 6, but the root zone will require winter protection and moderate to severe dieback is possible.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chilopsis linearis, commonly called desert willow, is a small deciduous tree or large shrub with a single trunk, upright, open branching structure, and vigorous growth habit. This plant is found growing in desert stream banks, washes, ditches, and depressions throughout the southwestern United States and north-central Mexico. Mature plants will reach up to 30' tall with a 20' spread. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, reaching up to 10"" long and only 0.25"" wide. White to rose-pink blooms (up to 1.5"" long) with ruffled petals appear on terminal panicles from May to June, but will sporadically rebloom throughout the summer particularly after rain. The fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers are highly attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other insect pollinators.Genus name comes from the Greek words cheilos meaning lip and opsis meaning resembling in reference to the distinct lip found on its calyx.The specific epithet linearis means ""linear"" and refers to the shape of the foliage.The common name desert willow refers to the resemblance of this plant to many willows (genus Salix), but it is more closely related to catalpa (genus Catalpa) and trumpetcreeper (genus Campsis).LUCRETIA HAMILTON is a compact selection that reaches a maximum height and spread of around 18'. The blooms are a bright fuchsia with light pink to white interiors. Its name honors Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton (1908-1986), an American botanist and botanical illustrator whose work focused primarily on the flora of the southwestern United States.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, fertile soils. Seldom needs pruning. Tolerant of air pollution and adapts well to urban settings. Intolerant of prolonged dry conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chionanthus virginicus, commonly called fringetree, is a deciduous, Missouri native shrub or small tree with a spreading, rounded habit that typically grows 12-20' tall (to 35' in the wild, however) and most often occurs in rich, moist woods and hillsides, moist stream banks, limestone glade margins and rocky bluffs and ledges. Common name refers to the slightly fragrant, spring-blooming flowers which feature airy, terminal, drooping clusters (4-6"" long) of fringe-like, creamy white petals. Dioecious (separate male and female plants), but also may have perfect flowers on each plant. Male flowers are showier than female flowers. Fertilized perfect or female flowers give way to clusters of olive-like fruits which ripen to a dark, bluish black in late summer and are a food source for birds and wildlife. Wide, spear-shaped leaves (to 8"" long) turn yellow in autumn.Genus name comes from the Greek words chion meaning snow and anthos meaning a flower for the snow white flowers of C. virginicus.Specific epithet means of Virginia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to scale and borers (particularly when grown in dry locations).
","
Garden Uses
Grow in groups or as specimens in lawns or in shrub or woodland borders. Also may be used in native plant gardens or near streams or ponds. Can be spectacular in full bloom.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Plant bulbs 3” deep and 2-3” apart in fall.  Plants naturalize easily by bulb offsets and self-seeding to form a spreading carpet of early spring bloom.  Foliage begins to fade shortly after bloom and generally disappears by late spring as plants go into dormancy until the following spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chionodoxa forbseii, commonly called glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial that is native to mountainsides in southwestern Turkey.  It is among the first bulbs to bloom in the spring, often poking its flowering stalks up through melting snows, hence its common name of glory-of-the-snow.  In the St. Louis area, plants typically bloom from mid-March to mid-April.  Each bulb produces 2-3 narrow, basal leaves and an upright flower stalk (to 6-12” tall) which is topped in very early spring by a loose raceme of 4-10 star-like, upward facing, six-petaled, soft violet-blue flowers with white centers.  

Chionodoxa forbseii is very similar in appearance to Chionodoxa luciliae (native to western Turkey).  The primary differences are that C. forbseii has slightly smaller flowers with slightly more pointed tepals on taller stems rising to as much as 12” tall with more flowers (up to 10) per flowering stem.  

Plants in the genus Chionodoxa are very similar to plants in the genus Scilla, the main differences being in tepal arrangement.  Some experts have merged Chionodoxa into the genus Scilla under the belief that the differences are not significant enough to warrant separate genus status.Genus name comes from the Greek words chion meaning snow and doxa meaning glory for its very early flowering when snow is still on the ground.Specific epithet honors James Forbes (1773-1861), British botanist who was employed as the gardener for the Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Nematodes are an infrequent but potentially serious problem in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Provides late winter to early spring color to the garden.  Best when massed and naturalized in rock gardens, sunny woodland areas, slopes or in lawns under large deciduous trees.  Mixes well with other early spring bulbs such as daffodils, species tulips and snowdrops.

Culture
In warmer areas where outdoor cultivation is possible, grow in light shade in well-drained soil. Indoor plants need bright indirect sunlight and watering well when in full growth. Keep moderately moist and temperatures above 45°F. Ideal temperatures are between 55° and 70°. Do not over fertilize as heavily fertilized plants may not form as many new plantlets. Your plants will not run short of nutrients; its tubers store reserve food. Cut off yellowed foliage and brown tips which will occur unless conditions are perfect. Plantlets form when the spider plant receives short days and long, uninterrupted nights for at least three weeks. This plant has fleshy tuberous roots, so it will need to be divided and repotted before the roots burst your container, especially plastic containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chlorophytum comosum is native to South Africa. It has linear leaves that are green or striped white. Flowering stems bear loose panicles of small, white, starry flowers. Plantlets are formed at the flowering nodes. When plants are full, they have an interesting, graceful, cascading habit.Genus name comes from the Greek words chloros meaning green and phyton meaning a plant.Specific epithet means furnished with a tuft.‘Variegatum’ has margins of white or cream. ‘Vittatum’ has recurved leaves with a central white stripe and green margins.
","
Problems
Plants are susceptible to root rot if waterlogged, whiteflies, spider mites, scales and aphids. Leaf tips turn brown from too little water, too low humidity, too much salts and excess of fluorides in the water. The foliage will also scald if placed in direct sun. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In warmer climates or during summer months in colder areas, spider plants are well-suited to use in planters or as a groundcover. The plantlets will cascade over a wall or planter forming a fountain effect. The variegated cultivars brighten up any shaded locations. It can be used as an edging along walks or in front of shrub borders. As an indoor plant, it is used primarily in baskets. It tolerates artificial light very well and therefore makes an excellent plant for offices and commercial settings.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10.   Best with consistent moisture in humusy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade, but best flowering is in full sun.  Trees with established root systems have some drought tolerance.  Leaves drop when temperatures sink below 27 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chorisia speciosa commonly called silk floss tree is a conical deciduous tree with somewhat irregular branching that is native to tropical and sub-tropical forested areas of Argentina and Brazil where it often rises to 40-60' tall.  This tree is now grown as a showy flowering tree in many tropical areas around the globe.  It performs well in southern Florida, parts of California and Hawaii.  It will typically develop an attractive, rounded, umbrella-like crown over time.  Trunks and branches are armed with stout triangular spines.  Trunks are green in youth, but may eventually mature to gray.   Each palmate, compound, light green leaf has 5-7 serrate, lanceolate leaflets (each to 5"" long).  Leaves typically drop in fall before this tree blooms.  Open, five-petaled, funnel-shaped flowers (3-5"" diameter) which somewhat resemble hibiscus bloom late fall to early winter.  Flowers are quite showy, featuring pink to rose-purple petals with creamy white to yellowish-white throats.  Flowers are followed by pear-shaped capsules (fruit pods) filled with seed embedded in silky white floss (hence the common name of silk floss tree).  In its native territory, floss has been harvested for a number of uses including stuffing pillows.  Capsules split open in spring when ripe releasing the seeds into the wind.  This fruit rarely sets on trees grown outside of tropical areas.  

This tree was recently removed by some experts from the Bombacaceae family to the Malvaceae family and renamed Ceiba speciosa.  Hibiscus is in the mallow family (silk floss tree and hibiscus have similar flowers) and Kapok tree is in the Ceiba genus (silk floss tree and kapok both have silky floss in seed pods).  RHS still recognizes Chorisia as the genus name.Genus name honors botanical artist Ludwig (Louis) Choris (1795-1828).Specific epithet means showy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Leaf spot may occur.  Watch for scale.  Difficult to propagate from seed or cuttings.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen.   Flowering tree.   This tree may be grown in containers.

Culture
Best grown in humusy, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates very light shade, and appreciates some afternoon protection from the hot sun in southern climates.  Plants tend to sprawl with too much shade.  Best planted in spring after last frost date, late summer or early fall (prior to September 15) so that the roots will have ample time to develop prior to the onset of winter.  Space new plants 18-24” apart.  Pinch stems back (as with most garden mums) from late spring to mid-summer (e.g., Memorial Day to the 4th of July) to control height, encourage bushy vegetative growth and delay the onset of flowering to late summer or early fall.  Leave stems unpinched for looser plants with earlier bloom time.  For best bloom, feed plants several times during the growing season.  Divide as needed (usually every 2-3 years) in spring or fall.  In warm winter climates, cut plants back to 6” after flowering.  In cold winter climates of Zones 5 and 6, leave the top growth in place to protect the crowns and apply a loose mulch such as straw or evergreen boughs.  It should be noted that in cold winter climates such as the St. Louis area, plants given winter protection will usually survive winter, but not always.  Winter hardiness can vary considerably from year to year and from location to location within the same hardiness zone.  

Notwithstanding the preceding recommendations, garden mums are frequently purchased in pots in late summer each year and grown as fall flowering annuals to supplement or replace summer annuals, rather than as permanent additions to a perennial garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chrysanthemum morifolium, commonly known as chrysanthemum or garden mum, is a compact, clump-forming, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 2-3’ tall.  It is native to China.  Solitary (infrequently appearing in a loose corymb), creamy yellow flowers (to 2 3/8” across) appear in an often prolific mid-season bloom extending from September to frost.  Flower colors of various cultivars of this species include shades of white, yellow, orange, lavender, purple or red.  Deeply lobed dark green leaves.  Species plants have been used in Chinese medicine to treat anxiety.Genus name comes from the Greek words chrysos meaning gold and anthemon meaning flower.Specific epithet means having leaves like mulberry (Morus).‘Bedazzled Bronze’ flowers are an intense burnt orange in the center fading to a lighter bronze-gold at the petal ends.
","
Problems
Aphids, thrips and spider mites may cause significant damage.  Potential disease problems include Botrytis, powdery mildew, leaf spots, stem and root rots, rust, verticillium wilt, aster yellows and viruses.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Prefers moist, acidic, organically rich soils in sun-dappled part shade.  Tolerates full sun only if grown in consistently moist soils.  Spreads by rhizomes to form an attractive ground cover, but is easily controlled.  Remove spent flower stems for best ground cover appearance.  Easily grown from seed and may self-seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chrysogonum virginianum, commonly called goldenstar, is a rhizomatous, low-growing perennial which typically forms a foliage mat to 3-4” tall spreading to 18"" wide or more.  It is native to woodland areas from Pennsylvania to Florida and Louisiana.  Star-shaped, daisy-like, bright yellow flowers (to 1.5” diameter) on stems originating in the leaf axils, bloom spring to fall in cool summer climates.  In hot summer climates such as St. Louis, bloom is profuse in spring, but usually becomes sparse or stops in the heat of the summer, with a light rebloom occurring in fall.  Flowering stems rise above the foliage mat to a height of 8-10"" tall.  Each flower has five, rounded, slightly-notched, yellow petals and a center tuft of yellow disk flowers.  Ovate, toothed, bright green leaves to 3” long.Genus name comes from the Greek words chrysos meaning gold and gonu meaning joint in reference to the location of the flower stems at the leaf axils (stem joints).Specific epithet means of Virginia.Common name is in reference to the star-like shape of the 5-petaled flowers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chrysopsis mariana, commonly called Maryland goldenaster, is an upright, fibrous-rooted, short-stoloniferous perennial that typically grows on stout, silky/woolly stems to 1-2.5’ tall.  Silky stems give rise to the additional common name of silk grass for this plant.  It is native to open fields, open woods, natural rock outcroppings, barrens, scrub, grasslands, roadsides and disturbed areas, usually in sandy soils, from southern New York and Ohio south to Texas and Florida.  

From a low rosette of basal leaves rise flowering stems from August to October crowned with clusters of yellow daisy-like flowers.  Each flower (1” diameter) has bright yellow rays (13-21 per flower) surrounding a center disk of tiny yellow florets, each flower being subtended by lanceolate, appressed, glandular, sticky flower bracts.  Petiolate, woolly-haired, oblanceolate to elliptic, basal leaves (each to 2-6” long and to 1 3/8” wide) have entire or dentate margins.  Sessile stem leaves are smaller and entire.  Fruits are reddish-brown achenes.  

Synonymous with Heterotheca mariana.Genus name comes from the Greek words chrysos meaning gold and opsis meaning appearance in reference to the golden flowers.Specific epithet means of Maryland in reference to the native territory of this plant which in part includes the State of Maryland.Common name is in reference to golden flowers on a plant from Maryland.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.  This is an understory tree fern of shady damp rainforest areas.  It prefers moist cool environments in part shade.  It tolerates full sun, but may need some shade in the heat of the day, particularly in hot dry conditions.  It also tolerates full shade.  Best growth typically occurs in tropical to subtropical environments.  It is intolerant of frost.  It needs protection from strong winds.  It can be grown from spores or cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cibotium glaucum, commonly known as Hawaiian tree fern or hapu’u pulu, is a slow-growing tree fern that is native to the Hawaiian Islands.  It is particularly noticeable on the Island of Hawaii where it is commonly found between 1000’ and 5600’ in moist humid rain forests located on volcanic slopes.  This is the most common tree fern in Hawaii.  Trunks typically mature to 6-10’ tall, but infrequently to as much as 25’ tall.  Mature trunk diameter ranges from 8” to 2’.  Fronds mature to 3-9’ long.  Arching, 2-3 pinnate compound blades are medium green above and glaucous green below.  Yellowish-brown hairs (pulu) cover the petiole bases and bud tips at the trunk ends.  Pulu was once harvested and exported to California as a stuffing material for mattresses and pillows, but this practice ended around 1880 when alternate stuffing materials of better quality became available.Genus name comes from the Greek word kibotion meaning a small box in probable reference to the box-shaped indusia which cover the spores.Specific epithet from Latin means blue green in reference to the color of the frond undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this tree fern often grows over time into an imposing and attractive accent or specimen.  It should be sited in areas with temperatures which never dip below 40 degrees F., which makes it very difficult to grow outdoors in most parts of the continental U.S.   Where not winter hardy, it is best grown in greenhouses.

Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Prefers neutral to alkaline soils.  Best in cool summer climates.  Does not grow well in the heat and humidity of the deep South.   Established plants have some tolerance for drought.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cichorium intybus, commonly known as chicory or succory, is a taprooted perennial herb that typically grows to 2-4’ tall.  Although native to Europe, it has naturalized over time throughout much of the U.S. where it is typically now found growing in fields, pastures, waste areas and roadsides.  A procession of attractive, stalkless, clear blue flowers (to 1” across) hug rigid nearly leafless stems in a long May/June to September/October bloom.  Spring bloom may begin as early as March in warm southern climates.  Rays are typically blue but occasionally white or pink.  Flowers usually close up by noon.  Lower lance-shaped, dandelion-like, basal leaves (3-6” long) are variously toothed, cut or lobed and have rough-hairy surfaces.  Upper stem leaves are smaller with clasping bases.  Deep fleshy taproot exudes a milky sap when cut.  

Some varieties of this species, such as the radicchio pictured above, are cultivated as leafy vegetables and other varieties are cultivated for their roots which are dried and used as a coffee substitute.  

Chicory has become a significant weed in some areas.  The within species is currently included on the “List C” itemized on the Colorado Noxious Weed Act which specifies that this plant must be either eradicated, contained or suppressed depending on location in the State.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Arabic name for one species.Specific epithet is a modification of another eastern name in reference to this plant and endive.Cichorium endivia is commonly grown and harvested as the salad green known as endive.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for snails, slugs and cutworms.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cinna arundinacea, commonly known as wood reed grass, is a warm season perennial grass that typically grows to 2-5' tall on erect, glabrous, light green culms (stems) clad with flat, narrow, gray-green leaves (to 14"" long and 1/2"" wide) with scabrous margins.  Each culm is topped in summer by an open, dense, nodding,  many-flowered, terminal panicle (to 4-10"" long) with ascending branches.  This grass is native to wet woodlands, moist ravines, damp thickets and streambanks from Quebec and Maine to Ontario and Minnesota south to Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas (Steyermark).  It is found throughout the State of Missouri.Specific epithet means reedlike.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cissus trifoliate, commonly known as marine vine, marine ivy or possum grape, is a semi-evergreen, fleshy-leaved, tendril-climbing vine of the grape family that typically grows to 30’ long.  It sprawls and climbs over rocks, shrubs and trees in a variety of different habitats (dry rocky exposures, chaparral, open woodlands, salt marshes, and stream banks) from southeastern Kansas and southern Missouri to Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona and parts of northern Mexico.  Deeply 3-lobed to trifoliate leaves have toothed margins.  Tiny flowers in flat-topped, greenish, 2-inch wide clusters (50-80 flowers per cluster) bloom in June and July.  Flowers give way to small, broad-ovate, inedible berries (each to 1/4” long) which ripen to black in fall.  Leaves emit an unpleasant odor when crushed.  

Synonymous with Cissus incise.Genus name comes from the Greek word kissos meaning ivy.Specific epithet means having three leaflets in reference to the trifoliate plant leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Established vines can be difficult to eradicate from the landscape.  Watch for aphids, scale and mealybugs.
","
Garden Uses
Cover for fences, pergolas, arbors or small buildings.  Train to grow on walls.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is best grown in organically rich, well-drained, sandy or clay loams in full sun.  Tolerates part shade, but best flowering occurs in full sun.  Best with consistent and regular watering.  Established trees have moderate drought tolerance.  Avoid wet poorly drained soils.  Plants will struggle with temperatures below 40 degrees F., and are intolerant of frost.  North of USDA Zone 10, calamondin is best grown in a container which is overwintered indoors.  Use a loose, all-purpose, well-drained potting mix.  Set containers outdoors in late spring in full sun in a location protected from wind.  Bring containers indoors in fall for overwintering to a cool but bright sunny southern window.  In winter, mist plants with water or use a humidifier (plants love humid environments).  Propagate by seed or cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
X Citrofortunella microcarpa, commonly known as calamondin or orange calamondin, is a small, bushy, evergreen tree or shrub which probably originates from China or the Philippines.  It is believed to be a cross between Citrus reticulata (mandarin) and Fortunella japonica (kumquat).   The ""X"" preceding the genus name indicates that this hybrid is between plants of different genuses (bi-generic hybrid).  Outdoors it is grown in the ground in southern Florida, southern Texas, California and Hawaii where frost is not a concern.  North of USDA Zone 10, it is grown in containers which are brought indoors in fall for overwintering to a bright sunny window.  Calamondin is primarily grown in the U.S. as an ornamental.  It is commercially grown in the Philippines, tropical Asia and parts of Latin America where the edible fruit is commonly consumed as a food.  Calamondin is a small tree or shrub to 6-20' tall (smaller when grown in containers as houseplants).  It produces a thin-skinned, juicy, golf-ball sized orange fruit (1 1/2"" diameter) which is edible but the pulp and juice are very acidic (sour).  The peel is sweet. Fruit remains on the plant for a long time (takes up to one year for fruit to ripen to orange).  Each fruit contains 6-9 fleshy segments.  Fragrant white 5-petaled flowers bloom primarily in spring, but basically may produce 4-5 smaller flushes throughout the year.  Seeing flowers and ripe fruit on the plant at the same time is not unusual.  Branches (sometimes with small number of short spines) are clad with oval, rich, slightly glossy, evergreen green leaves (to 2-4"" long).   Leaves are aromatic.

Genus name is a combination of the genus names Citrus and Fortunella. 

Specific epithet means small fruit.
","
Problems
Susceptible to Mediterranean and Caribbean fruit flies (Florida problem in particular).  Aphids, spider mites, mealybugs, scale and citrus bark borers.  Potential diseases include leaf mottling and citrus canker.
","
Garden Uses
Outdoors it is ornamentally attractive around homes or patios.  May be grown as a hedge.  Indoors, it serves as an excellent houseplant featuring fragrant white flowers and small orange fruits.  Fruit is very sour but has a large number of culinary uses including juice added to beverages, food flavoring, sauces, marmalades, pies,  and soups.  Commercially grown in Asia.

Culture
This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. It is best grown in fertile, organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained loams in full sun. Thrives in long hot summers. Intolerant of wet soils. Avoid compacted soils. Vines spread out over the ground. Seeds may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have risen to 70 degrees F., typically right after last spring frost date. Plant several seeds (up to six) together in hills that are 6-8' apart and thin later. Mulch around hills to help soils retain moisture and to discourage weed growth. Seed can also be started indoors about 3 weeks before the last spring frost date, with young plants set out after last frost date. Fertilize well. Fruits resting on mulch, straw or boards resist rot.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrullus lanatus is native to southwestern Africa. It is a scrambling, prostrate, hairy-stemmed, annual vine clad with curly tendrils and hairy, pinnately-lobed leaves. Stems grow to 10' or more. Pale green axillary flowers. Glabrous fruit is a spherical to oval watermelon that is typically green with darker mottling or striping. Over 1200 cultivars now exist, producing fruits from 6 to 50 pounds + (infrequently to 200 pounds or more). Each melon has a firm outer rind, a white inner rind and a sweet, juicy flesh (edible pulp) that is red, pink or yellow with imbedded black to brown seeds (seedless varieties are also available). Pick fruits only when ripe (""thunk"" test with thumb). Notwithstanding the virtues of its fruits, this vine has become a common weed of roadsides and open ground some parts of the world.Genus name comes from Citrus referring to the appearance of the fruit.Specific epithet means woolly.
","
Problems
Anthracnose, blossom end rot, fusarium wilt, bacterial wilt, downy mildew and powdery mildew may appear. Watch for cucumber beetles which should be removed immediately by hand. Additional potential insect pests include aphids, squash bugs, stink bugs, cutworms, pickleworm and squash vine boreres. Watch for mites. Spray for insects at night when bees (needed for cross-pollination) are less active.
","
Garden Uses
Cultivated watermelons are a popular summer fruit throughout the world. Edible melon-like flesh is juicy, sweet and tasty. Inner white rind is also edible. Rinds may be used as a vegetable. Watermelon rind can be pickled. Interesting wine.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where this citrus tree grows well in sandy, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Deep, fertile soils generally produce the best fruit crops.  Best overall performance occurs in full sun in locations sheltered from strong winds.  Provide consistent and regular watering.  Avoid wet poorly drained soils. Trees will tolerate temperatures that occasionally drop to 32 degrees F., but will generally not survive temperatures much below that.  Plants prefer warm tropical to sub-tropical climates with abundant rainfall.  North of Zone 10, this plant is best grown in containers that should be placed in sunny windows year round or taken outside in late spring but returned indoors in early fall before temperatures regularly dip below 60 degrees F.  Indoor plants should be regularly watered and foliage should be regularly misted (plants like humidity).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus histrix, commonly called Thai lime or makrut lime, is a thorny, multi-stemmed, evergreen shrub or small tree of the citrus family that grows to 6-25’ tall.  It is primarily native to Southeast Asia, but has widely naturalized in tropical areas with the specific location of its original distribution uncertain.  Glossy, aromatic, double (two-parted), evergreen leaves from this tree are commonly shredded for use as a flavoring in a variety of Southeast Asian food dishes including soups, curries, rice, stir-fry, fish cakes, salads and marinades.  Leaves may be harvested from home grown plants or purchased fresh or dried at Asian or specialty groceries.  Four to five petalled white flowers are fragrant.  Flowers are followed by rough bumpy green fruits (limes to 2” wide) which have a highly acidic flavor but little juice, so the juice and pulp is infrequently used in cooking.  Fruit rinds are sour tasting, but often used for flavoring in a diced-up or grated form.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word hustrix meaning hedgehog in reference to the thorns present on this plant.Many authorities prefer the common name of Thai lime or makrut lime to Kaffir lime because of the insulting and derogatory meaning of the word kaffir in some parts of the world (e.g., an insult used by some South African whites for blacks).

Culture
When grown in Zones 9 to 11, lemon trees will grow in fertile, well-drained soil in a sunny position protected from wind. During the growing season they need plenty of water and regular small applications of nitrogenous fertilizer to promote growth and fruit size. They need very little pruning. In indoor cultivation, place your plant in a well-lit, but not too warm location. A low temperatures in winter will encourage flowering. Place outdoors in late May to encourage natural pollination. Bring inside in September. Pinch to control shape and improve bloom. The fragrant flowers develop into fruit, but it may take a year before they attain the correct color(maturity) for harvesting.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus limon is the leading acid citrus fruit, because of its very appealing color, odor and flavor. The true lemon tree reaches 10 to 20 feet in height and usually has sharp thorns on the twigs. Leaves are reddish when young, and become dark green above, light green below. Mildly fragrant flowers may be solitary, or there may be two or more. Buds are reddish. Opened flowers have 4 or 5 petals, white on upper surface, purplish beneath. Fruit is oval with a nipple-like protuberance and is light-yellow. It is aromatic, and dotted with oil glands.Genus name is from classical Latin.
","
Problems
Problems may include mealybugs, red spiders and scale. If space is an issue, smaller, more compact cultivars are available. Plants respond well to being placed outdoors during the summer months in cold climates. Moving large trees from the inside to the outside and back again, however, may be problematic.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this citrus tree grows well in sandy, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Best performance occurs in full sun.  Provide consistent and regular watering.  Avoid wet poorly drained soils. Trees will tolerate temperatures that occasionally drop to 32 degrees F. , but will not survive temperatures to 26 degrees F.  Plants prefer warm tropical to sub tropical climates with abundant rainfall.  Pummelo is being successfully grown in the U.S. in protected locations as far north as USDA Zone 8b.   Species plants may be propagated by seed, but named cultivars should be propagated by grafting.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus maxima, commonly called pummelo, is a parent of the grapefruit (C. sinensis x C. maxima).  It is probably native to Thailand, but some experts say Polynesia and the Malay Peninsula.  Today it is a very popular fruit in Southeast Asia and China.  Some limited commercial growth takes place in the U.S. today (Florida, California and Hawaii).  The fruit of this tree is huge, typically growing to 6-9"" (less frequently to 12"") in diameter.  Weight is typically 2-4 pounds, but infrequently can mushroom to as much as 15 pounds.  Fruits are pear-shaped with a thick rind.  Taste of the fruit is reminiscent of grapefruit, but sweet instead of sour with less juice.  Edible flesh is white, yellow or pink.  Pummelo typically grows to 15-20' tall with a rounded crown.  In optimum growing conditions it may rise to as much as 50' tall.  Ovate to elliptic leaves (4-8"" long) are evergreen.  Solitary or clustered white flowers (each to 1 1/3"" long) may bloom up to four times per year in ideal conditions, resulting in fruit being present on the tree almost year round.  

Sweetener known as bitter narjin (used in TANG breakfast drink) comes from pummelo.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet means largest
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Popular edible fruit in southeast Asia.  Grown primarily as an ornamental in Florida and California.  Useful as a shade tree, background planting, and/or landscape accent.  The fruits are reportedly the largest citrus fruits in the world, and a small tree covered with fruit is an attention getter even if the fruits are never consumed.

Provide consistent and regular moisture.  Avoid wet poorly drained soils. Intolerant of hot summer conditions, drought and frost.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis, commonly called Buddha's hand or fingered citron, is a thorny shrub or small tree that typically matures to 8-15' tall.  It is native to northwestern India.  It is noted for producing a unique fruit (to 6-10"" long) which separates as it ripens into finger-like projections which have an inner white pith but no juice or pulp.  Ripe fruits turn bright yellow to orange yellow.  The hard outer rind/peel has an intense lemony taste which can be grated to form an excellent zest for food dishes or drinks.  Extremely fragrant, 4-5 petaled, white flowers (to 1"" long), each with 20-30 center stamens, emerge on and off during the year, but mainly in spring and fall.  Flowers are often flushed with pinkish-purple.  The main fruit harvest in the U.S. (southern Florida, California and Hawaii) occurs from late fall into winter (November to January), but small amounts of fruit are seen throughout the year.  Thorny branches are clad with serrated, elliptic, evergreen leaves (to 4-6"" long) which are aromatic (scent of lemon) when crushed.  Historically, fruits have been used in the Buddhist religion as temple offerings (hence the common name of Buddha's hand) in large part because each fruit (especially one with closed fingers) purportedly resembles a closed hand in prayer.  Additional fruit uses in the Far East include room freshener (place ripe fruit in the center of a room to add a touch of lemon to the air) and clothing perfume.  Culinary uses throughout the world include (1) zest for salad dressings, marinades, cooked foods or drinks (break off a finger and grate the exterior); (2) rind can be candied; (3) marmalades or jams; (4) fingers can be thin-sliced longitudinally and added to salads and cooked foods.  

Variety name comes from the Greek words sarkos meaning fleshy and dactylos meaning finger in obvious reference to the fruits.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet means medicinal.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small citrus tree will grow well in sandy, neutral, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Best performance occurs in full sun. Provide consistent and regular watering. Avoid wet poorly drained soils. Plants will struggle with temperatures below 40 degrees F., and are intolerant of frost. North of USDA Zone 9, it may be grown in a container as a houseplant. Use an all purpose, loose, well-drained potting mix. Set container outdoors in late spring in full sun in a location protected from wind. Bring container indoors in fall for overwintering in a cool but bright sunny southern window. In winter, mist plants with water almost daily or use a humidifier (plants love humid environments). Indoor plants may produce some fruit during the period of fall to spring. Propagate by grafting (plants are seedless).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus reticulata is commonly called mandarin orange. It is native to Southeast Asia. It is a rounded, usually thorny, evergreen shrub or small tree that grows to 15-25’ tall and produces fruit (to 3” diameter) resembling oranges. Mandarin oranges have been in cultivation since 2000 B. C. Ovate to lanceolate leaves (to 1 1/2” long) are evergreen. Fragrant white flowers bloom in the leaf axils in spring. It is sometimes commonly called Christmas orange because of its popularity over the Christmas holidays.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet means netted.‘Clementine’ is a variety of mandarin orange that reportedly originated as a chance hybrid in the Algerian garden of Father Clement Rodier in 1902, although some authorities claim it originated much earlier in China and simply spread over time to the Mediterranean area. It is the smallest of the mandarins, producing sweet, seedless, spherical to elliptic fruit (to 2 3/8” diameter) with a loose, deep orange-red peel during the period of fall to spring. Cultivar name honors Father Clement Rodier.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to anthracnose, scab, sooty mold, greasy spot, canker and gummosis. Potential insect pests include aphids, thrips, cutworms, plant bugs, weevils, leafrollers, mealybugs, scales and whiteflys. Watch for mites. Leaf drop indoors may mean soil is too wet or too dry.

Best grown in deep, evenly moist, well-draining, slightly acidic, sandy loams in full sun. Intolerant of heavy, saturated soils. Hardiness varies based on the cultivar, but in general oranges can be grown in Zones 9-11. Care should be taken to protect young trees and new growth on mature trees in the spring if temperatures fall below 32°F. Can be grown in colder climates as a container plant and brought indoors during the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus sinensis, commonly known as orange or sweet orange, is a small evergreen tree originally domesticated in subtropical Asia. These plants can reach up to 30' tall. Slender spines may be found at the leaf axils, particularly on new growth. The glossy, aromatic leaves are ovate in shape and can reach up to 4"" long. Their petioles are winged. Clusters of up to six fragrant, creamy white flowers bloom in early spring. The fruits are round to slightly oval in shape and can vary in size from 2-5"" in diameter. The color of the fragrant, exterior rind varies from yellow to deep orange, and the sweet, interior pulp can also vary in color from a bright orange to orange-red.

Citrus sinensis is not a naturally occurring species. Based on genetic analysis, most experts agree that this is a hybrid plant resulting from a purposeful cross between a hybrid mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata) and and a hybrid pomelo (Citrus maxima). Exactly when and where this cross took place is not fully understood, although some evidence suggests southern China may be the point of origin.Genus name is from classical Latin.The specific epithet sinensis means ""from China"", and refers to the center of early domestication of this plant.The common name orange entered the English language via the Old French orenge, a derivative of the Arabic name for this plant nāranj.'Moro' is a medium sized variety of blood orange that features fragrant, white flowers followed by sweet, red-fleshed fruits. Developed in Italy, this variety blooms in early spring and the fruits ripen  in winter. Plants will reach up to 20' tall with an equal spread.
","
Problems
Susceptible to a number of insect pests including citrus rust mite, citrus snow scale, purple scale, Florida red scale, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids, and fruit flies. There are also many diseases affecting oranges, including greasy spot, stem-end rot, sweet orange scab, citrus canker, and citrus greening disease.
","
Garden Uses
Oranges are widely cultivated for their fruit and essential oil. Can be grown in a container. Also suitable as a small ornamental tree in the home landscape, Mediterranean garden, or edible garden.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some dry soils once established. Best sited in a location protected from strong winds. Prune in summer because cuts made in late winter or spring tend to bleed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cladrastis kentukea, commonly called American yellowwood, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree of the legume family that typically grows 30-50’ tall with upright branching and a broad, rounded crown. It is noted for its pinnately compound foliage, panicles of fragrant white spring flowers, autumn seed pods and yellow fall color. The species is native to the southeastern U.S. In Missouri, it typically occurs in several southwestern counties near the White River and its tributaries. Pinnately compound leaves (usually with 7-11 leaflets) open as yellowish green, turn bright green in summer and then turn yellow in fall. Intensely fragrant, wisteria-like, pink flowers in large, drooping, terminal panicles (10-15” long) will cover a mature tree in late spring. Profuse bloom may occur only once every 2 or 3 years however. New trees may not bloom for the first 8-10 years. Bloom is similar in appearance to that of black locust (Robinia). Flowers give way to flat seed pods (2.5-4” long) that mature in September-October. Species was formerly called Cladrastus lutea.Genus name comes from the Greek klados meaning branch and thraustos meaning fragile for the brittle twigs.Specific epithet means of Kentucky.The wood of this tree contains a yellow dye that distinctively colors the heartwood and gives rise to the common name of yellowwood.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Verticillium wilt may occur. Trees will bleed if pruned at the wrong time. Bark is susceptible to sun scald. Bloom may be damaged by late spring frosts. Yearly bloom may not occur. Branching is fragile and vulnerable to damage from winter snow/ice or high winds.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent small tree for residential lawns, particularly on smaller properties. Also may be planted near patios and terraces. May be effectively grouped on larger properties. Roots go deep, so other plants may be easily grown underneath.

Culture
Cool weather annual. It is easily grown in average, moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants appreciate some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Plants also appreciate good air circulation. Start seed indoors in pots 6-8 weeks before last frost date or sow directly in the garden as soon as the ground can be worked. Plants often perform poorly in hot and humid summer weather, and will produce best bloom prior to the onset of peak summer heat. Plants may not last the growing season in hot St. Louis summers. Plants may reseed in the garden in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clarkia amoena, commonly called satin flower, is native from British Columbia to central California. It is a popular cool weather annual that is grown in beds and borders for its satiny, cup-shaped flowers whose petals have the texture of crepe paper. Flowers typically bloom from late spring to early/mid summer as announced by this plant’s additional common name of farewell-to-spring. Plants grow to 30” tall on erect to lax stems clad with lanceolate leaves (to 2.5” long). Four-petaled flowers (2-3” diameter) are red to pink to lavender often with a blotch or spot at the base of each petal. Cultivars come in both single and double form. Synonymous with and formerly known as Godetia amoena.Genus name honors Captain William Clark (1770-1838), who, with Captain Meriwether Lewis, made the first transcontinental expedition, crossing the Rocky Mountains in 1806.Specific epithet means pleasant or delightful.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to powdery mildew, verticillium wilt, stem rot and leaf spot. Watch for aphids and mites.
","
Garden Uses
Beds, borders, cottage gardens, cutting gardens or pots/containers.

Culture
Best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers organically rich, moist, fertile soils. Plant corms 3” deep and space 3” apart in fall. Naturalizes easily by bulb offsets and self-seeding, and can be weedy in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Claytonia virginica, commonly called spring beauty, is a delicate, much-beloved, native Missouri spring wildflower that typically occurs statewide in rich, moist woodlands and valleys, meadows, prairies and somewhat dry upland woods (Steyermark). It is a low-growing spring ephemeral that features clusters of star-like, five-petaled, white to light pink flowers (to ¾” wide) with pink veins and pink anthers. Flowers bloom in April atop thin stems rising 4-6” tall at bloom time. Narrow, linear, grass-like, dark green leaves (usually in pairs). Foliage continues to grow after bloom and may eventually reach 9-12” tall before the leaves disappear in late spring as the plants go into dormancy. Small, potato-like, underground tubers (corms) are edible (chestnut-like flavor) and were in fact consumed by early Americans, but are time-consuming to collect in quantity sufficient for a meal.Genus name honors John Clayton (1686-1773), who came to Virginia from England in 1705.Specific epithet means of Virginia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spread and post-bloom dormancy can both be a blessing or a curse depending on where plants are sited.
","
Garden Uses
Mass in rock gardens, woodland gardens, meadows, naturalized areas or wildflower gardens. Also may be effectively naturalized in lawns in somewhat the same manner as spring crocus.

Culture
Grow in fertile, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Roots should be kept cool, shaded and uniformly moist. Bloom on C. crispa occurs on the current year’s growth. Plants usually die to the ground in winter each year. Plants generally need an adequate supply of nutrients during the growing season to support the rush of growth. Plants may not be reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area where a protected location and straw winter mulch should be considered.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clematis crispa, commonly called swamp leather flower, curly clematis or blue jasmine, is a semi-woody twining vine that is native to floodplain forests, marshes and swamps from Virginia to southern Illinois south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it is found only in certain swampy areas in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark). Vines typically grow to 6-10’ tall. Solitary, bell-shaped, pale blue to violet blue flowers with white interiors bloom at the branch ends in late spring to early summer. Flowers are slightly fragrant. Flowers are followed by attractive seedheads. Branches are clad with pinnate compound leaves with broadly ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The flowers of this species have flared, ridged and frilled sepals with strongly recurving tips.Genus name comes from the Greek word klematis which is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means closely curled.
","
Problems
Clematis wilt is a potentially fatal fungal disease that can affect any clematis, but large-flowered, hybrid varieties are the most susceptible. Powdery mildew, leaf spots, rust and viruses can also be problematic. Potential insect pests include aphids, vine weevils, slugs/snails, scale and earwigs. Watch for spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
This clematis needs consistently moist soils. Consider placing it near bodies of water or in native plant gardens. It can be trained to climb a wall, trellis, fence, arbor, porch, lamppost or other stationary structure. It provides good architectural height and framework for small gardens. It can also be planted to sprawl over and through large shrubs, over old tree stumps or simply as a ground cover.

Solitary, nodding, urn-shaped, blue flowers, each with four twisted sepals and creamy anthers, appear in a long summer bloom. Each flower appears singly atop its own slender stalk (pedicil to 8” long) from May to July with continued lesser bloom into September. Each flower is followed by a plumose, ornamentally-attractive, silvery-green seed head. Native to shrubby areas, meadows and stream banks from central Europe to Russia and China.Genus name comes from the Greek word klematis which is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means with entire or uncut leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Roots should be kept cool, shaded and uniformly moist.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
This ground clematis can be trained to climb, but is usually left alone to crawl along the ground as the common name suggests. Produces abundant masses of small (3/4"" diameter), fragrant, white fringed flowers in late spring to early summer. Flowers are followed by silvery seed heads. General appearance of flower mass is reminiscent of Clematis terniflora. Foliage of this cultivar is an attractive purple.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Needs support if it is to be grown in an erect, more vine-like or shrubby form.
","
Garden Uses
Grow in the border with some support or training, or allow it to crawl along the ground in wild gardens, meadows or other areas where it will not interfere with other perennials.

Culture
Grow in fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade.  Roots should be kept cool, shaded and uniformly moist.  Bloom occurs on the current year’s growth.  This clematis belongs to Pruning Group 3 which means is should be pruned back hard (to approximately 8-12” from the ground) to strong leaf buds in late winter to early spring.  Notwithstanding the general pruning rules for Group 3, C. tangutica plants typically bloom earlier and longer if not cut back so hard.  Plants need an adequate supply of nutrients during the growing season to support the rush of growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clematis tangutica, commonly called golden clematis, is a yellow-flowered climbing vine that typically grows to 12-15’ long.  It often takes on the form of a sprawling shrub when grown in dry soils in sandy to gravelly areas.  Golden clematis is native to forests, slopes, grassy areas, gravelly expanses, and stream/river banks in central to northwestern China.  Slightly downy stems are clad with pinnate to bipinnate medium green leaves.  Lanceolate to oblong leaflets (to 2 1/3” long) have acute tips, tiny toothed margins, and cuneate to subcordate bases.  Bell-shaped, bright yellow flowers expand as they mature to 3-4” wide.  Long June to September bloom.  This species is considered to be the best of the yellow-flowering clematises.  Flowers give way to fluffy, silvery, highly ornamental seedheads.Genus name comes from the Greek word klematis which is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means from Kansu (Gansu) in northwestern China were the Tangut people live.
","
Problems
Clematis wilt is a potentially fatal fungal disease that can affect any clematis, but large-flowered, hybrid varieties are the most susceptible. Powdery mildew, leaf spots, rust and viruses can also be problematic. Potential insect pests include aphids, vine weevils, slugs/snails, scale and earwigs. Watch for spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
Can be trained to climb a wall, trellis, fence, arbor, porch, lamppost or other stationary structure.  Provides good architectural height and framework for small gardens.  Can also be planted to sprawl over and through large shrubs.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Unlike almost all other species of clematis, this plant will thrive and bloom well in considerable shade. Blooms on new growth. Prune hard in fall after flowering or in early spring. This clematis can be quite aggressive and will self-seed readily.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clematis terniflora, commonly called sweet autumn clematis is a fragrant fall-bloomer. It is a vigorous, deciduous, twining vine with an extremely rampant growth habit. If given support, it will climb rapidly with the aid of tendrilous leaf petioles to 20-25' in length. Without support, it will sprawl along the ground as a dense, tangled ground cover (to 6-12"" tall and 10' wide) which typically chokes out most weeds. Features aromatic, 1"" diameter, cruciform, pure white flowers (each with 4 narrow petal-like sepals) in terminal panicles from late August to October in a profuse bloom which typically covers the foliage. Flowers give way to attractive, plume-like seed heads. Compound, leathery-textured, shiny green leaves (3-5 oval to elliptic leaflets with cordate bases). Sweet autumn clematis can aggressively self-seed in the landscape, and has escaped cultivation and naturalized in many parts of the U.S., particularly in the East and Midwest. Synonymous with and sometimes sold as C. maximowicziana, C. paniculata and C. dioscoreifolia, although technically C. paniculata is a separate species native to New Zealand.Genus name comes from the Greek word klematis which is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means flowers in 3's.

Spreading, sometimes hard-to-control vine.
","
Garden Uses
Trellises, arbors, posts, fences. Can also be allowed to sprawl along the ground as a dense ground cover to hide old tree stumps or other eyesores. Can also be grown through large shrubs, but growth must be monitored to insure that the shrub is not overwhelmed.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clematis texensis, commonly called scarlet clematis or Texas clematis, is a small-flowered climber that typically grows to 10-15’ long.  It is native to Texas.  Tulip to bell-shaped, reddish orange to scarlet flowers (to 1” across) bloom from early summer to frost.  Pinnate to bipinnate medium green foliage with rounded to ovate leaflets (to 2 1/2” long). 

A large number of hybrids have been developed from C. texensis, many dating back to the late 1800s to early 1900s.  Tulip flower shape and showy crimson flower color have made C. texensis an attractive candidate for hybridizing.  Hybrids are sometimes mistakenly listed as cultivars of the species.  Hybrids are usually lumped into Texensis Group.Genus name comes from the Greek word klematis which is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means of Texas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clematis virginiana, commonly called woodbine, is a fragrant, fall-blooming clematis that is somewhat similar in flower to sweet autumn clematis (C. terniflora), but lacks the tough, leathery leaves of the latter. It is native to eastern North America, including Missouri where it typically occurs in moist low woodland areas and thickets bordering streams, ponds and fence rows (Steyermark). It is a vigorous, deciduous, twining vine with a rampant growth habit. If given support, it will climb rapidly with the aid of tendrilous leaf petioles to 20’. Without support, it will sprawl along the ground as a dense, tangled ground cover. Features sweetly aromatic, 1.25” diameter, pure white flowers (each with 4 narrow petal-like sepals) in axillary panicles from late August to October in a profuse bloom which typically covers the foliage. This is a dioecious species, with the pistillate flowers giving way to attractive, plume-like seed heads (hence the sometimes common name of old man’s beard). Compound green leaves, each with 3-5 oval to elliptic sharply-toothed leaflets.Genus name comes from the Greek word klematis which is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means of Virginia.

Can be a somewhat aggressive spreader.
","
Garden Uses
Perhaps best in woodland and native plant areas where it can be allowed to scramble along the ground, over shrubs and along fences. Also may be grown on trellises, arbors, or posts. If grown through large shrubs, growth should be monitored to insure that the shrub is not overwhelmed.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is best grown in evenly moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in full sun, but often appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Established plants have good drought tolerance.  Consider pruning stems hard to the ground in early spring in order to promote compact plant form.  Propagate by root suckers, cuttings or root sections.  Where winter hardy, plants will spread aggressively and invasively in the landscape by root suckers which should be regularly pruned out.  In St. Louis, rose glory bower may be grown in containers which are overwintered indoors in bright sunny conservatory-like rooms.  Mist foliage frequently.  Best indoor placement is a bright southern exposure with indirect sun.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clerodendrum bungei, commonly called rose glory bower, is a suckering deciduous shrub which grows somewhat rapidly to 6' tall.  It is native to China.  It is best ornamentally grown as a shrub to 2-3' tall.  Oval leaves (to 12"" long) with toothed edges are dark green above and fuzzy bronze-green beneath.  Leaves are malodorous when crushed.  Salverform (slender tube with abruptly spreading corolla), rosy red flowers (each to 3/4"" wide) bloom in loose clusters to 8"" across from summer into fall.  Flowers are very showy and fragrant.  Flowers are attractive to butterflies.  Rose glory bower will form a spreading colony by suckering if not restrained.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized from Texas to Georgia and Florida.Genus name comes from the Greek words kleros meaning chance and dendron meaning a tree.Specific epithet honors Russian botanist Alexander von Bunge (1803-1890).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, whitefly, mealybugs, scale and spider mites.  Leaf spot is an occasional problem.
","
Garden Uses
Attractive flowering shrub which should be planted in somewhat isolated areas where aggressive spread can be controlled.

Culture
Use a trellis to train this vine in the house. To grow glory-bower or bleeding heart vine indoors, a winter rest is required. This can be accomplished by moving the vine to a cooler location away from any heat source. A spot between 60 to 65F during the day and 5 to 10 degrees lower at night would be ideal. Some leaf drop is a normal response to entering winter dormancy. During this period, water just enough to keep the soil from drying out and withhold fertilizer. In late winter or early spring, prune the vine before new growth emerges. Because flower buds are produced on current season’s growth, pruning at this time will encourage the production of vigorous flowering shoots. Do not be afraid to prune severely. Thin out old, overcrowded shoots and any other far-reaching growth to keep the vine in bounds. After pruning, move the plant to a warm, brightly lit location or outdoors if temperatures have warmed sufficiently. Water when the soil surface feels dry.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is grown in organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. In St. Louis, it is not reliably winter hardy and, if attempted, should be sited in a protected location with a winter mulch.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clerodendrum trichotomum, native to China and Japan, is a coarse, sometimes unkempt, deciduous shrub or small tree that grows 10-20’ tall. It is most often seen as a suckering shrub. It must be trained to grow as a tree and is rarely seen growing in that form. As an ornamental, this shrub is perhaps best noted for its late summer flowers, showy fruit and malodorous foliage. Tubular, fragrant, white flowers in long-peduncled cymes (to 6-9” across) bloom in the upper leaf axils from late summer into fall. Flowers are followed by small bright blue fruits, each subtended by a fleshy red calyx. Opposite, toothed to entire, ovate, dark green leaves (to 5-8” long) produce no fall color. When bruised, the leaves do produce a unique aroma reminiscent of peanut butter as memorialized by the sometimes used common name of peanut butter tree for this plant. Harlequin glorybower is a more frequently used common name.Genus name comes from the Greek words kleros meaning chance and dendron meaning a tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, grow in shrub borders or woodland margins. In St. Louis, plants may be attempted in sheltered locations with winter mulch.

Tolerates clay soils.  Tolerates full shade.  Promptly remove root suckers unless naturalized look is desired.  Propagate by cuttings.  Prune if needed in late winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clethra alnifolia, commonly called summersweet, is a deciduous shrub that is native to  swampy woodlands, wet marshes, stream banks and seashores, often in sandy soils, along the coast from Maine to Florida and west to Texas.  It is a rounded, suckering, densely-branched, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ (less frequently to 8’) tall and is noted for producing a mid to late summer bloom of sweetly fragrant white flowers which appear in narrow, upright panicles (racemes to 2-6"" long).   Flowers give way to dark brown seed capsules (1/8"" diameter) which may persist into winter.   Mature stems have scaly, dark gray to brown black bark.  Serrate, obovate to oblong, glossy dark green leaves (to 3-4” long) turn variable but generally attractive shades of yellow to golden brown in fall.  Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and bees.Genus name comes from the Greek klethra the name for alder of which the leaves resemble.Specific epithet means leaves like alder.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spider mites may be a concern in dry conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Summersweets are somewhat unique among flowering shrubs because of their ability to bloom in shady locations in late summer when few other shrubs are in bloom.  Mass or group in lawns, foundations or shrub borders.  Good flowering shrub for shade or woodland gardens.  Effective as a hedge.  Also appropriate for moist soils along stream banks or pond/water garden peripheries.  Also may be naturalized in cottage gardens, wild gardens or naturalized areas.  Plant near a patio to enjoy the fragrant late summer bloom.  Compact size makes this an ideal flowering shrub for smaller gardens.

Best grown in neutral to slightly alkaline, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Also tolerates some poor soils. Generally prefers moist soils with good drainage, but some plants do well in the drier soils found in limestone glades. Plants may spread in the garden by stolons and/or self-seeding. Shear or cut back plants after flowering to tidy the planting, to remove unsightly foliage and/or to prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Easily grown from seed. Hardy in Zones 4-8.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clinopodium arkansanum, commonly called limestone calamint, is a rhizomatous perennial of the mint family that typically forms a dense, low-growing foliage mat with upright, leafy flowering stems rising to 12” tall. It is native from Ontario to Minnesota south to New York, Ohio, Illinois, Arkansas and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in limestone glades, bluffs, bald knobs, wet meadows and stream gravel bars in the Ozark region of the state (Steyermark). Runners (stolons) clad with oval to elliptic leaves creep along the ground rooting at the nodes to form mats of foliage. Flowering shoots, clad with small, opposite, linear leaves, rise 8-12” tall bearing tiny two-lipped white to rose purple flowers on stalks from the leaf axils. Main flowering occurs June-July with additional more sporadic bloom into fall. The leaves are extremely fragrant when crushed. Additional common names for this plant include wild savory, Ozark calamint and Arkansas mint.The genus name Clinopodium comes from Greek and means ""like a bed's foot"" in reference to the knob-shaped flowers.The specific epithet arkansanum means ""of Arkansas"" and refers to part of the native range of this species.

Culture
In climates where temperatures do not dip below 60 degrees F., this tropical climber may be grown outdoors as a short lived perennial in evenly moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.   It appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot climates.  It needs a support on which to climb.  Where temperatures dip below 60 degrees F., this plant may be grown in a greenhouse.  It is frequently grown as an annual or biennial.  It is easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Clitoria ternatea, commonly called butterfly pea, is an evergreen climber that typically grows on slender stems to 10' (less frequently to 15') tall.  It will trail through a shrub to 6'.  Native territory of this vine is unclear... some say Asia and some say tropical America.  The specific epithet is in reference to the Island of Ternate in Indonesia which was considered by Linnaeus as native territory.  Regardless of native origin, it is today pantropical thanks to naturalization from human cultivation.  This climber features compound odd-pinnate leaves (to 5"" long), each with 5-9 elliptic to ovate rich green leaflets.  Pea-like, clear blue flowers (2"" diameter) with yellowish centers bloom singly or in pairs from summer to fall.  Fruits are flattened pods.Genus name comes from the Latin word clitoris meaning clitoris for a characteristic of the flower.Specific epithet means in clusters of three.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for spider mites.  Whiteflies may appear. Anthracnose and bacterial soft rot.
","
Garden Uses
Grown on a support such as a trellis.  Weave through a hedge.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soils and growing conditions. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where it often suffers partial dieback or dies to the ground in harsh winters. Best planted in a protected location in the St Louis area. Usually will not produce fruit in early years.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cocculus carolinus, commonly called Carolina moonseed, is a deciduous, Missouri native, woody vine which climbs with thin twining stems or scrambles along the ground, and primarily occurs in rocky open woods, wood margins, glades, fence rows, roadsides and stream/pond margins in the southern 1/3 of the State. Best ornamental features are its foliage and its attractive red berries in fall. Typically grows 10-12', but may grow larger in the deep South where it is not susceptible to winter dieback. Tiny, greenish-white flowers appear in loose, drooping, terminal and axillary clusters (racemes) in summer, but are insignificant. Flowers give way to loose clusters of bright red, flattened, pea-sized drupes which mature in late summer and persist well into fall. Medium green leaves (to 4"" long) are of variable shapes ranging from oval to heart-shaped to triangular.Genus name comes from the Greek word kokkos meaning berry in reference to the fruits of this vine.Specific epithet means from North or South Carolina.The single crescent-shaped seed inside each drupe resembles a third quarter moon or small snail shell, thus giving rise to the common names of Carolina moonseed and Carolina snailseed for this vine.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12.  This tropical species thrives in humid, frost free coastal lowlands and seashores.  Best growth occurs in moderately fertile, humusy, moist, well-drained soils in full sun.   Needs minimum temperature of 64 degrees F. to produce fruit.  May be grown in containers (sow seed in spring) in a soil-based potting mixture with grit or sand added.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cocos nucifera, commonly called coconut or coconut palm, is a tall tree that is native to tropical islands in the western Pacific.  It has been commonly planted in frost free tropical areas throughout the world in a variety of conspicuous locations including coastal areas, beaches, parks, along streets, residential yards, near commercial buildings/hotels, and on golf courses.  In the U. S., it will grow in southern Florida, the southern tip of Texas and Hawaii.  It does not perform well in southern California.  Trees will typically mature to 50-100' tall over time.  This is a single-trunked palm with a branchless, often-curved, light gray trunk which is swollen at the base and topped by a crown of pinnate, downward-arching, green fronds (to 15-20' long).  Fragrant yellow flowers in elongated clusters to 4' long only appear in tropical climates where they bloom on and off throughout the year.  Female flowers are followed by single-seeded coconuts (to 14"" long).  Each coconut has a fibrous husk which surrounds a woody shell containing the coconut meat, milk and oil which are used in numerous food products around the world.  Drinkable coconut water is the liquid inside green coconuts.  Coconut milk is produced by grating the matue coconut meat, mixing it with water and then squeezing. Coconut meat can be eaten raw or cooked.  Dried coconut meat (copra) is crushed to obtain coconut oil with residue sometimes added to animal feed.  Coconut oil is used in cooking, cosmetics, soaps and margarine.  The growing tip of this palm can be harvested and marketed under the name of heart of palm, but harvesting kills the plant.   Other plant parts have a variety of uses, particularly in the Far East, including trunk (construction), fronds (weaving, baskets, thatching), endosperm (cosmetics) and sap (palm sugar or toddy).Genus name comes from the Portuguese word coco meaning mask.Specific epithet means bearing nuts.
","
Problems
Lethal yellowing is a serious disease which has killed thousands of coconut palms in Florida.  It is spread by a leaf hopper.  Injections help stabilize plants but will not cure the disease.  Resistant varieties are being developed.  Insect pest problems include palm leaf skeletonizer, aphids, nematodes and scale.  Spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
Large palm grown ornamentally and/or for harvest to coconut fruits.

Culture
Easily grown as an indoor houseplant or outdoor accent plant in well-drained, humusy soil. Winter hardy in Zones 11-12. Plants need bright light for best leaf color, with some direct sun. May lose lower leaves in too much shade. Plants also prefer high humidity. Consider standing plant on bed of wet pebbles to increase humidity when indoors. Water regularly to keep soils moist, but not wet, during the growing season. Does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering from fall to late winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Codiaeum variegatum, commonly called croton or Joseph’s coat, is native to Malaysia, Pacific islands and northern Australia. It is a woody-based perennial that typically grows to 6’ tall. In the St. Louis area, it is grown as a 2-4’ tall houseplant or outdoor accent plant. It is noted for its bold, often striking foliage. Glossy, leathery, smoothed-edged leaves are in bright colors ranging from yellow, pink, orange, red, bronze, purple and green plus combinations thereof in patterns involving blotching and striping. Leaves are oval to lanceolate (to 18” long). Foliage color is distinctive, appearing somewhat gaudy at times.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the Ternate vernacular name, kodiho.The specific epithet variegatum means variegated, in reference to the color of the foliage.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. Best grown in organically rich, well-drained soils in filtered sun or light shade. Keep soils consistently moist but not soggy. Plants prefer climates with daytime temperatures of 70-80 degrees F. and nighttime temperatures of 60-65 degrees F. Leaf drop may occur when temperatures dip below 55 degrees F. Plants may be grown indoors in containers with a fast-draining potting soil. Indoor plants like bright sunny windows, but when taken outdoors appreciate light shade. Plants first flower when they reach 3-4 years old. Fertilize during the growing season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Coffea arabica, commonly called Arabian coffee, is an upright tropical evergreen shrub or small tree that grows to 10-15’ tall. Although native to Ethiopia, Arabian coffee has been cultivated in Arabia for over 1000 years. It is now commercially grown in subtropical and tropical areas throughout the world. In coffee plantations, plants are kept trimmed to 6’ tall for ease of harvest and best production. Indoor container plants typically grow to about 4-6’ tall. Plants feature (a) glabrous, glossy, elliptical, dark green leaves with prominent veins and wavy margins, (b) fragrant (resembles the aroma of jasmine), star-shaped, white flowers that bloom in axillary clusters of 2-9, (c) green two-seeded fruits (berries) that gradually mature to yellow, light red and finally deep red and (d) fissured bark on older branches. Berries are edible with a pulpy grape-like texture, but it is the seeds (coffee beans) that are coveted. Berries are picked by hand when ripe and depulped, with the extracted seeds/beans then dried in the sun before roasting. Coffee beans contain caffeine.Genus name comes from the Arabic word kahwah meaning beverage.Specific epithet means of Arabia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale, mealybug, thrips, caterpillars and mites. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In frost free climates, it is grown commercially for production of coffee beans or ornamentally as a specimen or in shrub borders. Elsewhere, it makes an attractive container plant for sun rooms that can be taken outside to patio areas in summer.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich,  medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.   Sharp soil drainage helps prevent corm rot.  Purchase dormant corms in late summer (August) and plant them immediately (3” deep and 6” apart) for bloom in fall.  Dig and divide corms when plants become crowded (every 3 years).  Site corms in areas where the short flowers may be enjoyed in fall but where the taller spring foliage will not interfere with other perennials.  Reduce watering when the foliage yellows and begins to die back (July).  Resume watering again in late summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Colchicum autumnale, commonly called autumn crocus or meadow saffron, is a cormous perennial that typically blooms in early fall.  Plants send up only foliage (5-8 lanceolate dark green leaves to 10"" long) in spring.  Foliage gradually yellows and dies by early summer when the plants go dormant.  Naked flower stems (1-6 stems per sheath) rise from the ground to 6-10” tall in late summer to early fall, each stem bearing a star-shaped, lavender-pink to lilac-pink flower.  Fall flowers have no foliage, hence the sometimes used additional common name of naked ladies for this plant.  Medicinal colchicum and colchicine come from the corms and seeds.  The common name of autumn crocus is somewhat misleading because autumn crocus (Colchicaceae family but formerly included in Liliaceae family) is not closely related to spring crocus (Iridaceae family).   Among the differences, the flowers of autumn crocus have six stamens and the flowers of spring crocus have three stamens.Genus name come from the abundance of the plant in Colchis, the Black Sea region of Georgia, Caucasus.Specific epithet refers to autumn when this plant flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs and snails.  Fungal smut may attack the leaves (remove and destroy affected plants).  Weak flower stems tend to flop.
","
Garden Uses
Meadows, woodlands beds.  Good for pockets in the landscape where spring and summer plants are fading.  Good around patios or along walks.  Plant with low ground covers which may help support weak flower stems.  Generally inappropriate for prominent parts of beds or borders because of the unsightly appearance of the spring foliage as it yellows and declines on its way toward summer dormancy.

Culture
This winter annual performs best in moist, rich, well-drained loams in sun dappled areas or light shade. Seeds germinate in fall, with the tiny seed plants overwintering. Sow seed in summer to early fall. Plants will self-seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Collinsia verna, commonly called blue-eyed Mary, is a showy bi-colored (blue and white) woodland wildflower that blooms in spring (April – May) on weak slender stems clad with opposite medium green leaves. In the wild, it is often found blooming in large sprawling drifts, sometimes covering an acre or more. It is typically found in rich woods, slopes, valleys and floodplains of small streams from Iowa, Wisconsin and New York south to Kansas, Arkansas, Kentucky and Virginia. Two-lipped flowers feature two white upper lobes and two blue lower lobes with a fifth lobe folded and concealed. Flowers bloom on slender stalks from the leaf axils, often of whorls of 4-6. Plant stems rise to about 15” as of the time of bloom, but continue to grow thereafter to as much as 24” tall as seed forms and ripens. Plants die out in early to mid summer. Oval lower leaves with a few marginal teeth are on leaf stalks. Upper lanceolate leaves are sessile with few if any marginal teeth.Genus name honors Zaccheus Collins (1764-1831), Vice-President of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.Specific epithet means spring in obvious reference to bloom time.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade. Does well in sandy, clay soils. Will tolerate somewhat dry soil conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Collinsonia canadensis, commonly called horsebalm, is a Missouri native plant that occurs in rich woodlands, ravines and wooded slopes, often in limestone soils, and typically grows 2-3' (less frequently to 4') tall. Features elongated, branching, loose, pyramidal, terminal clusters of tiny, 2-lipped, tubular yellow flowers in mid to late summer and large, sharply toothed, ovate, green leaves (4-8"") on square stems. Foliage (when crushed) and flowers of this mint family member have a citronella-like fragrance. Leaves can be used to make teas, and the underground roots (rhizomes) were formerly used medicinally in the treatment of urinary and kidney problems and as astringents.Genus name honors Peter Collinson, 18th-century English Quaker merchant.Canadensis means of Canada.

Culture
Best grown in fertile, humusy, organically rich, medium to wet soils in part shade or filtered sun. When growing plants in garden soils, provide regular moisture, especially during dry summer periods, and do not allow soils to dry out. Plants may also be grown as pond marginals in up to 6"" of standing water. Plants produce prodigious amounts of growth and appreciate regular fertilization during the growing season. Site plants in locations protected form strong winds. Tubers may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, however, tubers should be planted in the ground in mid-spring (after April 20), dug up in fall after first frost and then overwintered in a cool dry location (set in dry peat or wood shavings) where temperatures do not dip below 45 degrees F, in somewhat the same manner as done for cannas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Colocasia esculenta, commonly called taro, is a tuberous, stemless, frost-tender perennial of the arum family (see also calla lily and jack-in-the-pulpit) which typically grows 3-6' tall and as wide. For gardeners, it is primarily grown as a foliage plant with huge, heart-shaped to arrowhead-shaped, conspicuously-veined, downward-pointing, peltate leaves (to 2' long) on long, stout, succulent stems. As the common name suggests, each leaf purportedly resembles an elephant's ear. Calla lily-like flowers with yellowish-white spathes and spadixes are infrequently produced and usually hidden by the foliage when they do occur. This species is also commercially grown as a food crop in Hawaii (poi is made from the tubers) where it is commonly called taro.Genus name comes from the Greek word kolokasia used for the root of Nelumbo nucifera.Specific epithet means edible or good to eat.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, fertile, humusy soils which do not dry out. Mistflower is a vigorous plant that spreads aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding. In some areas of the U.S., the species is considered to be a spreading weed. Propagate by clump division in early spring. Plants will grow in wet areas. Taller plants may be cut back in summer to prevent flopping.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Conoclinium coelestinum, commonly called mistflower, is a late summer to fall-blooming herbaceous perennial that is native to the Eastern United States. It looks like annual ageratum and in that regard is sometimes commonly called hardy ageratum. But it is perennial and can spread aggressively by rhizomes. It typically grows to 1-2’ tall on downy purplish stems clad with coarsely-toothed, ovate-deltoid leaves (to 3” long). The flowers of this member of the aster family lack rays. Numerous small, fluffy, tubular, blue-purple flowers (to 1/ 2” across) with discoid heads bloom from July to October in dense flat topped terminal clusters (corymbs). In Missouri, mistflower is primarily found south of the Missouri River in low wet woods, at bluff bases, and in moist ground along streams, ponds, sloughs and ditches (Steyermark). It is also commonly called blue boneset. Conoclinium coelestinum is synonymous with Eupatorium coelestinum.Specific epithet means sky-blue or heavenly.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to powdery mildew. Leaf miners and aphids may also visit. Plants tend to flop and may need support. Spreading tendencies must be watched, particularly if planted in the perennial border.
","
Garden Uses
Wild flower garden. Naturalized areas. Periphery of stream of pond. Open woodland garden. May be grown in borders as long as sited in an area where spreading roots will not interfere with other plants.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Contradina verticillata, commonly known as Cumberland rosemary, is a rare evergreen shrub of the mint family which typically grows to 15-20” tall.  It is native to the Cumberland Plateau in several counties in eastern Kentucky and Tennessee where it is primarily found growing on sandy/gravelly stream banks which typically experience seasonal flooding followed by somewhat dry summers.  Key shrub features include:  (a) clumps/mats of spreading, bark-shredding, almost square-stemmed branches which root in the ground at the nodes, (b) stiff, aromatic, tiny, fragrant, needle-like leaves (to 3/4” long) which mimic the shape and exude the strong scent (particularly when crushed) of Salvia rosmarinus  (the culinary rosemary of the mint family), (c) red-spotted, pink to lavender, two-lipped flowers (to 3/4” long) in axillary 2-7 flowered verticillasters which bloom in May-June, and (d) nutlets which fall to the ground when the calyx drops.  

Federally listed as Threatened by the USFWS (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service).Genus name honors Solomon White Conrad (1779-1831), American botanist from Philadelphia.Specific epithet is in reference to the flowers appearing in verticillasters.Common name is in reference to the Cumberland Plateau where this plant is native.

Culture
Cool weather annual. Easily grown from seed in loose, moderately rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Avoid wet soils. In southern climates, sow seed outdoors in fall. In northern climates sow seeds outdoors in early spring. For earlier bloom, sow seed indoors in individual peat pots about 8-10 weeks prior to last spring frost date. Space plants in the garden about 9-12” apart. Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom. Plants may self seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Consolida ajacis, commonly called giant larkspur, is native to the southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is a showy annual that grows 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall on stems clad with deeply cut, palmate leaves. Blue flowers (uncommonly pink or white) bloom in showy spike-like racemes from late spring throughout summer in cool northern climates. In the deep South, plants tend to die out from the heat by mid summer. Each flower has a distinctive spur. Plants have escaped gardens and naturalized in many parts of the U. S. Dwarf to tall cultivars in single or double form expand plant flower colors to include various shades of pink, salmon, carmine, white, violet and lavender. Popular mixtures include Dwarf Hyacinth Series, Dwarf Rocket Series and Giant Imperial Series. Leaves, flowers and seeds are toxic if ingested. This larkspur is synonymous with and formerly known as Consolida ambigua. It was once included in the genus Delphinium.Genus name comes from the Latin word meaning consolidate or make firm in reference to a former herbal use of plant materials to stop bleeding and heal wounds.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew may occur.

Culture
Easily grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Performs well in sun-dappled shade.  In optimum growing conditions, it will spread rapidly by rhizomes, almost to the point of being weedy, to form dense colonies in the landscape. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, including dry and clay soils. This is a long-lived plant which naturalizes easily in woodland areas and may be left undisturbed for many years.  Flowering may decrease over time, however, at which point dividing the plants may become appropriate.  This is a cool weather perennial which is not recommended for growing in hot and humid summer climates south of USDA Zone 7a where it will perform poorly.  May easily be propagated in spring or fall by root division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Convallaria majalis, commonly known as lily-of-the-valley, is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial that that typically forms an indefinitely-spreading ground cover to 8-12” tall.  It is native to Europe, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized over time throughout much of temperate eastern and central North America plus parts of the Northwestern U.S.  Foliage and flowers make this an attractive and beloved shade garden wildflower.  Each plant has 2 to 3 parallel-veined lanceolate-ovate to elliptic green leaves (to 5-10” long and to 1-3” wide).  In spring, an erect to slightly arching flowering stem rises from the center of each leaf clump bearing a one-sided raceme (to 4-9” long) of nodding, bell-shaped, sweetly fragrant, white flowers (corollas to 1/3” long) which bloom in early to mid-spring.  Each raceme typically contains 5-10 flowers.  Globoid orange-red berries may appear in fall, each berry containing 1-6 seeds.

All parts of this plant are very poisonous because they contain cardiac glycosides.Genus name comes from the Latin word convallis meaning a valley.Specific epithet means of or belonging to May in reference to the month of flowering.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids and spider mites.  Stem rot, leaf spot, leaf blotch and anthracnose may appear but usually are not significant deterrents to growing this plant.  Foliage decline will occur in hot summers. Deer tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses
Best as a ground cover for shady areas where aggressive spread is desired.  May be too rambunctious for shady areas of rock gardens or borders.  Popular cut flower.  Performs well under the shade of trees and shrubs.

Culture
Warm weather annual. It may act as a short-lived perennial in USDA Zones 9-11 where it is winter hardy. It is best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Some light afternoon shade is appreciated in hot summer climates. Established plants have good tolerance for heat and drought. It is easily grown from seed sown indoors in pots 4-6 weeks before last spring frost date or from seed sown directly in the ground outdoors several days prior to last frost date.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Convolvulus tricoloris native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, non-trailing, bushy annual that rises to 16” tall and as wide on branching stems clad with lanceolate medium green leaves. It is commonly called dwarf morning glory because of the similarity of its tri-colored flowers to those of morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor). Each flower forms a flared trumpet (to 2” wide) featuring blue petals with a white throat and yellow center. Flowers last one day, but bloom in succession over a long late spring to late summer bloom period.Genus name comes from the Latin word convolvo meaning to twine around.Specific epithet refers to the three-colored flowers of blue, white and yellow.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In its native habitat, it tolerates a wide range of soils from boggy conditions to dry ones. In cultivation, it is best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. In St. Louis, it must be grown in containers which can be placed outside on patios in summer or grown indoors year-round as houseplants. Keep container soils consistently moist in summer but reduce moisture indoors in winter. Container patio plants should be overwintered in bright sunny spots in the home or in greenhouses. This plant develops a taproot which needs the root space of a large and deep container for best growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cordyline australis, commonly called giant dracaena or cabbage palm, is one of the best known and most recognized of the plants indigenous to New Zealand where it typically grows as a single or multiple-trunked tree to 20-30’ tall. It was introduced into the U.S in the early 1800s and now grows in a number of locations in California and the southern U.S. It features sword-shaped gray-green leaves to 3’ long and only 2-3” wide. Impressive panicles of small fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, however container-grown plants rarely flower. Young plants feature a fountain of grass-like leaves with no trunk and are often sold in this form as houseplants. Patio container plants will slowly develop a cane-like trunk or trunks over time, eventually growing to as much as 15’ tall. Synonymous with Dracaena australis.Genus name comes from the Greek word kordyle meaning a club.Specific epithet means southern.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for mealybugs, scale and spider mites, particularly on indoor plants.
","
Garden Uses
Grow in containers in the St. Louis area for use as summer patio plants or as year round houseplants. Mature container plants can lend a tropical flavor to patios, decks and other locations around the home.

Culture
Grow in St. Louis as a houseplant. Best in a well-drained, peaty potting mixture. Plants need bright indirect light, but tolerate light shade. Avoid direct sun. Needs consistently moist soils from spring to fall. Does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering from fall to late winter. Ti plant can be relatively easy to grow indoors as long as its high humidity needs can be met. Consider growing in humidified rooms, place pot on a bed of wet pebbles or grow in bathrooms. Regular temperatures in summer and minimum 65F in winter. Plants may be grown from stem sections, commercially referred to as Ti logs, by placing the same on a bed of moist gravel until roots appear.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cordyline fruticosa, commonly called Ti plant, typically grows as a short tree or shrub to 10’ tall in its native habitat of tropical Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and some Pacific islands including Hawaii. In the United States, it can only be grown outdoors in far southern Florida, southwestern United States and Hawaii. As a houseplant in the St. Louis area, it more often grows a 3-6’ tall. This is a long-lived broadleaf evergreen that features thin lance shaped leaves (to 30” long and 6” wide) that emerge pinkish red, but mature to deep green. Scented, white to pale lavender flowers appear in panicles (to 12” long) in summer and are followed by red berries. Houseplants rarely flower and fruit, however. As the plant ages, it loses its lower leaves. Leaves of this plant have been used in Hawaii to make hula skirts and edible rhizomes for food. Varieties in commerce include plants with colored or variegated foliage. Synonymous with C. terminalis.Genus name comes from the Greek word kordyle meaning a club.Specific epithet means shrubby or dwarf.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Plants tolerate humidity and some dry conditions, but are not as drought tolerant as some other species of Coreopsis. Prompt deadheading of spent flower stalks can be tedious for a large planting, but does tend to encourage additional bloom. Plants may be sheared in mid summer to promote a fall rebloom and to remove any sprawling or unkempt foliage. In optimum growing conditions, this stoloniferous perennial will slowly spread in the garden over time to form an attractive planting, but spread is easy to check. Clumps may be divided in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis auriculata, commonly called lobed tickseed or mouse ear coreopsis, is a stoloniferous, short-lived, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in a dense, bushy, slowly-spreading clump to 12-18” tall.  It is native to open woods in the southeastern U.S. from Virginia to Florida and Mississippi.  Mostly basal, hairy, petioled, ovate to elliptic leaves (to 3” long) are deep green.  Each leaf has a distinctive pair of small lateral lobes at the base of the blade which resemble the shape of mouse ears, hence the sometimes used common name of mouse ear coreopsis for this plant.  Daisy-like flowers (to 2” wide) have 8 yellow rays (each having a three-lobed apex) surrounding a yellow center disk.  Flowers bloom primarily from April to June atop upright flower stalks rising 18” tall.   A sparse and intermittent rebloom may continue throughout the summer into fall if spent flowers are regularly deadheaded.  In hot summer climates like the St. Louis area, plants usually stop blooming in mid-summer with a small rebloom sometimes occurring in fall after temperatures moderate.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning ""bug"" and opsis meaning ""like"" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet comes from the Latin ariculatus meaning having an ear-like appendage in obvious reference to the ear-like lobes at the base of each leaf.‘Nana’ is a dwarf selection that typically grows to 6-9” tall.  Excellent for border fronts and edging.  It will not come true from seed and should be propagated by division or cuttings.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Tends to sprawl if grown in moist and/or fertile soils. Crown rot may occur if grown in moist, poorly drained soils. Foliage decline in hot summer climates may occur if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Bright flowers and long bloom provide excellent accent in borders or meadows. Best in groups or massed. Also effective as an edger for walks/paths. Will form colonies if allowed to spread.

Culture
Easily grown in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun.  Thrives in poor, sandy or rocky soils with good drainage.  Tolerant of heat, humidity and drought.  Prompt deadheading of spent flower stalks encourages additional bloom and prevents any unwanted self-seeding.  Freely self seeds and can become somewhat weedy.  Also spreads by rhizomes.  Plants are somewhat short-lived and self-seeding helps perpetuate a good planting in the garden.  Plants may be cut back hard in summer if foliage sprawls or becomes unkempt.  When grown in borders or other formal garden areas, division may be needed every 2-3 years to maintain robustness.   May be grown as annuals.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis grandiflora, commonly called large-flowered tickseed, is native to prairies, glades, open woods, thickets, roadsides and open ground in the southeastern U.S. from Florida to Texas and New Mexico north to Georgia, Missouri and Kansas.  It typically grows in a clump to 2' tall.  Daisy-like single flowers (2-3"" diameter) feature deep yellow rays (notched at the tips) surrounding a darker golden yellow center disk.  Flowers appear singly atop slender, erect stems rising to 2' tall.  Flowers typically bloom from late spring to late summer and sometimes into fall, though bloom period can be much shorter if spent flowers are not regularly deadheaded.   Upper leaves are pinnatifid and deeply lobed, but lower leaves at the base of the plant are lobeless and linear.  Through introduction and garden escapes, this coreopsis has become established in the eastern and central U.S. well north of its native range.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning ""bug"" and opsis meaning ""like"" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet means large-flowered.Common name of tickseed is in reference to the resemblance of the seeds to ticks.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage is susceptible to powdery mildew, leaf spot and rust. Compact plants are less likely to sprawl than taller varieties of coreopsis.  Crown rot may occur if grown in moist, poorly drained soils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis integrifolia, commonly called Chipola River tickseed, is a yellow-flowered herbaceous perennial in the aster family which typically grows in a slowly spreading clump rising to 18-24” tall.  This is a rare species which is native to low woodlands, floodplains and stream/river banks primarily in the area of the Chipola River in the Florida panhandle but also in a few other scattered coastal plain populations in far northeastern Florida, southern Georgia and southeastern South Carolina.  

Single flowers (2"" diameter) bloom from September to late October atop upright stems rising above the foliage clump to as much as 30” tall.  Stems are clad with waxy, unlobed, opposite, elliptic to lanceolate, deep green leaves (to 2” long).  Each flower typically features 8 deep yellow rays (3 deeply cut lobes at the apex of each ray) surrounding a dark purplish-black center disk with two sets of bracts underneath.  Flowers give way to 1/ 4” long flattened seeds with two bristles on the tip.     

Coreopsis integrifolia is listed as both critically imperiled (G1 and S1) and imperiled (G2 and S2) on both Federal and State of Florida lists.  It is listed as endangered by the Florida Department of Agriculture.  

Flowers of the genus Coreopsis (16 species native to Florida) were designated in 1991 as the Florida State Wildflower.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning ""bug"" and opsis meaning ""like"" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words integer meaning entire and folium meaning leaf in reference to the undivided plant leaves.Common name of Chipola River tickseed is in reference to the native habitat and the flower seed resemblance to ticks.

Plants are somewhat short-lived and self-seeding helps perpetuate a good planting in the garden.  Plants may be cut back hard in summer if foliage sprawls or becomes unkempt.  When grown in borders or other formal garden areas, division may be needed every 2-3 years to maintain robustness.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis pubescens, commonly called star tickseed or downy tickseed,  is native to rocky open woods, bluff bases, valleys, gravelly stream beds, rocky ledges along streams, alluvial thickets and railroad right-of-ways from Florida to Texas north to Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and Kansas.  It typically grows in a clump to 3-4' tall on slender downy stems clad with ovate-lanceolate leaves which are sometimes lobed at the base.  Daisy-like single flowers (2"" diameter) with star-like involucre bracts feature yellow rays (lobed or notched at the tips) surrounding a darker golden yellow center disk.  Flowers typically bloom from late spring to late summer and sometimes into fall, though bloom period can be much shorter if spent flowers are not regularly deadheaded.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning ""bug"" and opsis meaning ""like"" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet from Latin means hairy in reference to the pubescent leaves and stems.Common name of star tickseed is in reference to the star-shaped involucre bracts and resemblance of the seeds to ticks.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Unlike other species of Coreopsis, C. rosea and its cultivars have very little drought tolerance and need consistently moist soils in order to thrive. Avoid poorly-drained heavy clay soils, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flower stalks can be tedious for a large planting, but does tend to encourage additional bloom and prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Plants may be sheared in late summer to promote a fall rebloom and to tidy the planting (stems often become matted as summer progresses). In optimum growing conditions, plants will spread in the garden by rhizomes and self-seeding to form a dense ground cover, sometimes to the point of being considered aggressive.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis rosea, sometimes commonly called pink coreopsis or pink threadleaf coreopsis, is primarily native to wet sandy soils along water margins in coastal plain areas from Nova Scotia to Maryland. It is noted for being the only coreopsis with pink flowers. It closely resembles C. verticillata in appearance and habit, but lacks the latter's heat and drought tolerance. It is a rhizomatous perennial which typically grows in dense, bushy clumps to 1-2' tall. Features daisy-like flowers (1/2 to 1"" diameter) with pink untoothed rays and yellow center disks. Flowers appear singly on short stalks in a profuse and lengthy summer bloom. Whorls of linear, grass-like, light green leaves lend a fine-textured and airy appearance to the plant.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning ""bug"" and opsis meaning ""like"" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet means rose-colored.Plants in the genus Coreopsis are sometimes commonly called tickseed in reference to the resemblance of the seeds to ticks.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be an aggressive spreader. Crown rot may occur if grown in moist, poorly drained soils. Performs best in cool summer climates, and can appear rather scraggly with poor flowering in the hot and humid summer conditions of the deep South. Weak plant stems tend to sprawl and mat, particularly in hot and humid climates with periodic heavy summer rainfall.
","
Garden Uses
Long summer bloom and airy foliage provide good accent in borders or rock gardens. Good small area ground cover. Also effective as an edger for borders, foundations and walks/paths. Naturalized areas, native plant gardens or cottage gardens.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis tinctoria, commonly called plains coreopsis, garden coreopsis, golden tickseed or calliopsis, is an annual coreopsis that is native to the western U.S. (west of the Mississippi River). It is commonly cultivated in gardens as an annual, and has over time escaped from gardens and naturalized thoughout most of the eastern U. S. to the Atlantic Ocean. In Missouri, it is typically found in rocky glades, sandy ground and along roadsides and along railroad tracks (Steyermark). It grows 2-4’ tall and to 18” wide on smooth, stiff, branching stems. One-two pinnate finely cut green leaves with linear-lanceolate leaflets (to 3” long) appear mostly on the lower half of the plant. Solitary, daisy-like flowers (to 1-2” diameter) feature yellow rays (7-9 per head) with reddish brown center disks. Each ray is toothed at the tip and spotted reddish-brown at the base. Flowers typically bloom over a long late spring to fall period. This species is synonymous with and formerly know as Calliopsis bicolor.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning ""bug"" and opsis meaning ""like"" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet means used in dyeing.Plants in the genus Coreopsis are sometimes commonly called tickseed in reference to the resemblance of the seeds to ticks.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Light afternoon shade helps avoid possible sun scald in hot summer climates. Best growth occurs in cool and dry summer climates. Plants dislike areas with high humidity and frequent rain. Seeds may be planted directly in garden soil after the last spring frost date. They may also be planted in pots. Plants grow rapidly (pinching off young leaves can begin in 30 days). Snip off flower stems before flowering to prolong harvest of leaves. Plant new seed every 2 weeks to insure a continuous crop of leaves. Allow some plants to flower and seed if harvest of coriander seed is desired. Seeds are ready for harvest in 90 days. Plants tend to bolt easily (abandon leaf growth, flower, seed and die) in hot summer climates. A late summer planting of seed can be done for fall harvest of leaves but seed will not mature before frost. Plants are annuals but have naturalized in some parts of North America.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Coriandrum sativum is a warm weather annual that is commonly grown in herb gardens for its lacy, strong-scented foliage (cilantro) and its aromatic seeds (coriander). It is native to southern Europe and the western Mediterranean. It typically grows in a basal clump to 24"" tall and to 18"" wide. Plants may sprawl in the garden. Finely-divided upper leaves are fern-like. Broad-lobed lower leaves resemble those of Italian parsley. Cilantro leaves are used for flavoring a number of food dishes including salads, salsas, meats, sauces and soups. Leaves are best used fresh, but may be frozen in ice cube trays for later use. Stems are also edible when young. Coriander seeds ripen in round, yellow-brown pods. Seeds are typically ready for harvest about 90 days after seed is planted (late summer to early autumn in St. Louis). Mature seeds have a pleasantly sweet-spicy fragrance and are used for flavoring sauces, meats, sausages, stews, chutneys, pies and cakes. Seeds are an ingredient found in curry powder. By contrast, young seeds are never used for culinary purposes because they have an unpleasant fragrance and bitter taste. White to pink to pale lavender flowers bloom above the foliage clump in loose compound umbels (to 2"" across). Swallowtail butterflies feed on plant leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek name koriandron from koris referring to the unpleasant smell of the unripe fruits which disappears when they are ripe and dry.Specific epithet means cultivated.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Potential disease problems include damping off, rot, wilt and bacterial blight, blossom blight and aster yellows. Potential insect pests include grasshoppers, leafhoppers and cabbage loopers. Plants are noted for bolting in hot summer weather.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus alternifolia is a small deciduous tree or large multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-25’ tall with distinctive tiered/layered horizontal branching which is upward-turned at the tips.  It is native to both moist and dry forests, forest margins, stream banks and fields from Newfoundland to Minnesota south to northern Arkansas and through the Appalachians to Georgia and Alabama.  Small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers bloom in flattened cymes (each to 2 1/2"" across) in late spring (May-June).  Flowers give way to bluish-black fruits (drupes) on red stalks.  Fruits mature in late summer.  Elliptic-ovate, medium green leaves (to 3-5” long) turn reddish-purple often tinted yellow or green in fall.  Although the leaves of most species of dogwood are opposite, those of pagoda dogwood are alternate, hence the specific epithet and often used common name of alternate-leaf dogwood.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the alternate arrangement of the leaves.Common name of pagoda dogwood is in reference to the tiered horizontal branching.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus amomum, commonly called silky dogwood, is a medium-sized deciduous shrub that is typically found in moist lowland areas, swamp borders, floodplains, shrub wetlands, and along streams and ponds in Eastern North America (New Foundland to Ontario south to Missouri, Mississippi and Florida). Twigs and leaf undersides have silky hairs, hence the common name. This dogwood typically grows to 6-12’ tall with an open-rounded form. Tiny yellowish-white flowers (showy petal-like white bracts are absent) in flat-topped clusters (cymes to 2.5” across) bloom in late spring to early summer. Flowers give way to attractive berry-like drupes that change from white to blue as they ripen in late summer (August). Birds are attracted to the fruit. Oval to elliptic, medium green leaves (2-5” long) have conspicuous veins. Attractive fall color is usually absent. Twigs are purplish brown in spring, and have a distinctive brown pith. Genus name comes from the Latin word for horn (reference to hard wood). This shrub is also commonly called swamp dogwood in reference to habitat and kinnkinnik (tobacco) in reference to a prior use of shrub bark by Native Americans as tobacco.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus canadensis, commonly known as dwarf cornel or bunchberry, is a shrubby deciduous ground cover that typically grows to 4- 9” tall and spreads in the landscape by creeping rhizomes.  This dwarf species of dogwood produces the same shaped leaves and flowers found on the familiar Cornus florida tree except in smaller size.  In North America, it is primarily native to coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests throughout Canada and the northern U.S., south in the Appalachians to Virginia and in the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico.  This is a circumpolar species which is also native to eastern Asia.  

Conspicuously-veined, oval to elliptic, glossy, medium to dark green leaves (to 1-2” long) are located near the stem tops in false whorls of 4-6.  Red to purple fall color.  Flowers emerge in late spring.  Each flower consists of a tiny greenish-yellow umbel surrounded by four showy, oval, petal-like white bracts (each bract to 1” long).  Flowers give way to terminal clusters of berry-like drupes (1/4” diameter) which ripen in August to bright red with good persistence on the plant until late fall unless earlier consumed by birds.  Drupes are edible for humans.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is in reference to the native habitat of this plant which includes Canada.Common name of dwarf cornel refers to the red fruits which resemble in color the semi-precious gemstone carnelian (or cornelian).  Common name of bunchberry refers to the fruit clusters (berries in bunches).

Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained, sandy soils in full sun to part shade. This tree is winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-9. Its best growth is in sheltered western coastal areas. It dislikes the heat and humidity of the southeastern U.S. It will not grow in the St. Louis area.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus capitata is an evergreen to semi-evergreen tree or shrub that is native to the Himalayas, northern India and China. As a tree, it typically grows to 20-40’ tall. Ovate to lanceolate, evergreen leaves (to 4-5” long) are leathery and rough to the touch. Leaves are dark green above and gray-green below. Some older leaves turn purplish or reddish tones in fall, eventually dropping in spring as new growth appears. This dogwood is not considered to be reliably evergreen because its foliage may drop in cold winters in the colder areas of its growing region. Flowers bloom in late spring to early summer (June-July). The showy parts of the dogwood “flower” are the four (infrequently 6), pointed, petal-like, bracts (each to 1.5” x 3.0”) that surround a center cluster of insignificant, greenish-white, true flowers. Bracts are creamy white to pale yellow. Flowers are followed by fleshy, edible, strawberry-like berries that ripen in clusters in fall. In addition to being a good food source for birds, the fruit is also ornamentally attractive.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word caput meaning head in reference to the mounding flowers and fruits.This dogwood is also commonly called Himalayan strawberry tree in reference to the fruits.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus controversa, commonly called giant dogwood,  is a rounded, medium-sized, deciduous tree that will grow somewhat rapidly to 35-40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with distinctive horizontal branching in tiers.  This tree and C. alternifolia are the only dogwoods that feature alternate leaves.  Small, creamy-white flowers appear in flattened clusters (cymes to 3-7” wide) in late spring (May-June).  Although individual flowers are small, a tree in full bloom is quite showy.  Flowers give way to clusters of bluish-black fruits (drupes to 1/2”) that mature in late summer.  Fruits are attractive to birds.  Ovate dark green leaves (3-6” long) are glaucous beneath.  Fall color is variable but usually not showy, ranging from at best a respectable red-purple to a more typical pale green and yellow.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.
","
Problems
Susceptible to leaf spot, root rot and canker. Scale, leaf miner and borers are occasional insect pests. Unlike C. alternifolia, this species is resistant to twig blight.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soils, including poor ones. Tolerates drier soils than all other Missouri native dogwoods. Spreads by underground stems to form large colonies in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus drummondii, commonly called rough-leaved dogwood, is a common, thicket-forming, Missouri-native dogwood that typically grows 6-15’ tall and as wide. Throughout most of its growing range, it is primarily found in moist to wet locations. However in Missouri, it is more often found in dryish soils of rocky woods, glades, thickets and prairies (Steyermark). Common name refers to its elliptic to oval leaves (to 5” long) that are rough above and downy below. Tiny, yellowish-white flowers appear in flat-topped clusters (to 2.5” diameter) in late spring. Flowers lack the showy bracts of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), being more similar in appearance to the flowers of gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa). Flowers give way to clusters of white drupes which mature in late summer. Fruit is attractive to birds and is generally considered to have as much if not more ornamental interest than the flowers. Twigs are reddish-brown. Fall color is variable, but may include quality shades of purple and red.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet honors 18-19th century Scottish botanist Thomas Drummond.
","
Problems
This native species is well-adapted to Missouri and has no serious insect or disease problems here. Some susceptibility to leaf spot, twig and leaf blights and canker. Scale, leaf miner and borers are occasional insect pests.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental features are minimal. Best in naturalistic plantings in moist soils where plants are allowed to spread and form thickets. Property line screens. Informal hedges. Shrub borders.

May be inadvisable at this time to plant this tree in areas where dogwood anthracnose infestations are present (see problems section below).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus florida, commonly known as flowering dogwood, is a small deciduous tree that typically grows 15-30’ tall with a low-branching, broadly-pyramidal but somewhat flat-topped habit.  It arguably may be the most beautiful of the native American flowering trees.  It is native from Maine to southern Ontario to Illinois to Kansas south to Florida, Texas and Mexico.  It is the state tree of Missouri and Virginia.  It blooms in early spring (April) shortly after, but usually overlapping, the bloom period of the redbuds.  The true dogwood flowers are actually tiny, yellowish green and insignificant, being compacted into button-like clusters.  However, each flower cluster is surrounded by four showy, white, petal-like bracts which open flat, giving the appearance of a single, large, 3-4” diameter, 4-petaled, white flower.  Oval, dark green leaves (3-6” long) turn attractive shades of red in fall.  Bright red fruits are bitter and inedible to humans (some authors say poisonous) but are loved by birds. Fruits mature in late summer to early fall and may persist until late in the year.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word flos flower in reference to its attractive spring flowers.Common name of dogwood is in probable reference to an old-time use of hard slender stems from this tree for making skewers once known as dags or dogs.
","
Problems
Flowering dogwood, when stressed, is susceptible to a rather large number of disease problems, the most serious of which is dogwood anthracnose.  Although this anthracnose is not yet a serious problem in Missouri, it has caused considerable devastation in parts of the eastern U.S.  Plants are also susceptible to powdery mildew, leaf spot, canker, root rot and leaf and twig blight.  Stressed trees also become vulnerable to borers.  Leaf miner and scale are less serious potential insect pests.
","
Garden Uses
Popular as a specimen or small grouping on residential property around homes, near patios or in lawns.  Also effective in woodland, bird or native plant gardens.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus kousa, commonly called Kousa dogwood, is a small, deciduous flowering tree or multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-30’ tall, with a vase-shaped habit in the early years but eventually maturing to a more rounded form.  Bloom occurs in late spring.  The showy parts of the Kousa dogwood “flower” (3-5” across) are the four narrowly pointed petal-like white bracts which surround the center cluster of insignificant, yellowish-green, true flowers.  Flowers are followed by berry-like fruits (to 1” diameter) which mature to a pinkish red in summer and persist into fall.  Fruits are technically edible, but are usually left for the birds.  Oval, pointed leaves (to 4” long) are dark green, but usually turns attractive shades of reddish-purple to scarlet in autumn. Mottled, exfoliating, tan and gray bark on mature trees is attractive in winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is the Japanese name for this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. This plant has better disease resistance and better cold hardiness than flowering dogwood, Cornus florida, and is an excellent alternative to flowering dogwood in areas where dogwood anthracnose is a problem. In full sun locations, leaf scorch may appear, particularly if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
A stunning flowering tree or large shrub with good fall color. Plant as a specimen or in small groupings on residential property around homes, near patios or in lawns. Also effective in shrub borders, woodland gardens, bird gardens or naturalized areas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus mas, commonly known as cornelian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that is native to central and southern Europe into western Asia.   It typically grows over time to 15-25' tall with a spread to 12-20' wide.   Scaly, exfoliating bark develops on mature trunks.  Yellow flowers on short stalks bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge in dense, showy, rounded clusters (umbels to 3/4"" wide).   Each umbel is surrounded at the base by small, yellowish, petaloid bracts which are much less showy than the large decorative bracts found on some other species of dogwood such as Cornus florida (flowering dogwood) and Cornus kousa (kousa dogwood).  Ovate to elliptic dark green leaves (to 4"" long) typically develop insignificant fall color.  Fruits are ellipsoid, fleshy, one-seeded berries (drupes to 5/8"" long) which mature to cherry red in mid-summer.  Fruits are edible, although sour tasting fresh off the plant.  Fruits may be used for making syrups and preserves.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word for male in reference to the absence of fruits that sometimes occurs for several years after new plants begin to bloom.Common name refers to the cherry-like fruits which resemble in color the semi-precious gemstone carnelian (or cornelian).
","
Problems
Cornus mas is noted for having excellent resistance to dogwood anthracnose and dogwood borer.  When properly grown, this dogwood usually has few insect or disease problems.  Stressed trees  may become vulnerable to borers.  Leaf miner, gall midge and scale are less serious potential insect pests.  Potential disease problems include dogwood anthracnose, leaf spot, crown canker, root rot, powdery mildew and leaf and twig blight.
","
Garden Uses
Valued for its very early spring bloom. Best as a hedge, screen or foundation plant or as a specimen or grouping in the shrub border. May be naturalized in open woodland or naturalized areas. May also be trained as a small tree.

This tree is somewhat similar in physical appearance to Eastern flowering dogwood (C. florida).  It performs well in the western U.S., but unfortunately does not prosper in the eastern U.S.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus nuttallii, commonly known as Pacific dogwood, Canadian dogwood or mountain dogwood, is a medium size deciduous tree, although sometimes a tall shrub, that typically grows to 15-40’ (infrequently to 70’)  tall with a rounded to conical crown.  It is native to coastal regions west of the Cascades from southern British Columbia to southern California with a small disjunct population in northern Idaho.  It is commonly found along stream banks and in low-elevation coniferous, hardwood and mixed coastal forests and on slopes, predominantly in areas of 3000’ to 5000’ in elevation.  Pacific dogwood is the western version of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) which is native to eastern North America.  One of the main differences between these two species is in the number of showy bracts on each flower (6 on Pacific dogwood and 4 on flowering dogwood).  Pacific dogwood features:  (a) horizontal tiered branching, (b) elliptic to ovate or obovate dark green leaves (to 4 1/2” long) which turn attractive shades of yellow to orange to red in fall, (c) large flowers which bloom mid to late spring, each flower consisting of a small cluster of tiny purple-green flowers (to 3/4” diameter) encircled by six large, showy, white, petal-like bracts (each to 3” long), and (d) fruits (1/ 3” long) which mature to a showy bright red or orange.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet honors Thomas Nuttall (1786-1859), American ornithologist and artist.
","
Problems
Pacific dogwood, when stressed, is susceptible to a rather large number of disease problems the most serious of which is dogwood anthracnose.  Plants are also susceptible to leaf spot, crown canker, root rot and leaf and twig blight.  Stressed trees also become vulnerable to borers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus officinalis, commonly called Japanese cornel dogwood, is native to China, Japan and Korea. It usually grows as a large, spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub to 15-25’ tall. It also may be grown as a small tree. It is very similar to Cornus mas, except it grows with a slightly more open habit, flowers one week earlier, has more attractive bark and often has brown hair tufts in the vein axils on the leaf undersides. Ovate to elliptic, dark green leaves (to 4 3/4” long). Variable fall color ranges from drab pale yellow to attractive reddish-purple. Yellow flowers appear in late winter to very early spring before the leaves in 3/4” wide clusters (umbels). Flowers are followed in fall by oblong red fruits (drupes) that are technically edible but astringent. Exfoliating bark has tones of gray and brown.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet means sold in shops. Applied to plants with real or supposed medicinal use.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus racemosa, commonly called gray dogwood, is a deciduous shrub which is native to Missouri and typically occurs in moist or rocky ground along streams, ponds, wet meadows, glade and prairie margins, thickets and rocky bluffs. It grows 10-15' tall and features white flowers borne in terminal racemes (hence the species name of racemosa) in late spring and grayish-green, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves (2-4"" long). Foliage turns an interesting (but not always showy) dusky purplish red in fall. Terminal stems holding the flowers are distinctively red and provide interesting contrast to the clusters of small white berries which form after the flowers have dropped. Red stem color is more easily seen after the fruits are gone, and red color often persists into early winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being produced in racemes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. The dogwood bud gall occurs on this species but is usually not a significant problem.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent when planted in groups and left alone to spread in naturalized areas or native plant gardens. Also effective in shrub borders, along streams or ponds or near buildings or when planted as a screen. Can be particularly useful because of its ability to grow in poor soils.

Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerant of a wide range of soils.  Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soils.  Best stem color occurs on young stems.  Although pruning is not required, many gardeners choose to remove 20-25% of the oldest stems in early spring of each year to stimulate growth of new stems which will display the best color.  As an alternative to annual pruning, some gardeners prune all stems close to the ground in early spring every 2-3 years to renew.  Any loss of flowers through spring pruning is not terribly significant since the small flowers of this dogwood are rather ordinary.  Remove root suckers if desired to prevent colonial spread.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus sanguinea, commonly known as blood twig dogwood, European dogwood or common dogwood, is an upright, round-topped, spreading, twiggy, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that typically matures to 8-15’ tall and as wide.  It is native to northern Europe and northwestern Asia.  Simple broad-elliptic to ovate leaves (to 2-4” long and to 1 3/4” wide) are dark green above and villous on both sides.   Dull white flowers with a fetid fragrance bloom in loose clusters (pubescent cymes to 2” diameter) in May to early June.  Flowers are followed by blue-black fruit (drupes to 1/ 4” across) which mature in August-September.  Fruit is not particularly showy.  Fall color can be a stunning red-purple, but often falls short of this mark by appearing greenish-purple.  Stem is slender, hairy, usually purple or dark blood red but often greenish on the lower side.  Older branches are greenish gray.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word sanguineus meaning blood red in reference to both the red fall foliage color and the reddish twigs and young stems of this shrub.Blood twig dogwood is a misleading common name for this species.  New twigs and young stems have red color, but by and large the mature stems on this plant are greenish-gray.  Considerable variation in stem color.  Blood twig common name may have been given to this species in regard to fall color rather than young stems.

Best grown in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soils, including swampy or boggy conditions. Trim roots with a spade and promptly remove root suckers if colonial spread is undesired. Best stem color occurs on young stems. Although pruning is not required, many gardeners choose to remove 20-25% of the oldest stems in early spring of each year to stimulate growth of new stems which will display the best color. As an alternative to annual pruning, some gardeners prune all stems close to the ground (coppice to 8"") in early spring every 2-3 years to renew. Any loss of flowers through spring pruning is not terribly significant since the small flowers of this dogwood are rather ordinary. Plants become stressed and more vulnerable to diseases such as canker in hot and humid summer climates south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus sericea, commonly known as red twig dogwood or red osier dogwood, is an upright-spreading, suckering shrub that typically grows in the absence of pruning to 6-9’ tall with a slightly larger spread. With the exception of the lower midwest and deep South, this species is native to much of North America where it is typically found growing in wet swampy areas, wetland margins or along lakes and rivers. Ovate to lanceolate, medium to dark green leaves (2-5” long) acquire interesting shades of red to orange eventually fading to purple in autumn. Reddish stems turn bright red in winter and are particularly showy against a snowy backdrop. Tiny, fragrant, white flowers appear in flat-topped clusters (cymes to 2.5” diameter) in late spring, with sparse, intermittent, additional flowering sometimes continuing into summer. Flowers give way to clusters of whitish (sometimes with a bluish tinge) drupes in summer. Fruit is quite attractive to birds and is generally considered to have as much if not more ornamental interest than the flowers. 

Red stems somewhat resemble the reddish stems of some osier willows, hence the common name of red osier dogwood. Some cultivars of this species (e.g., C. sericea 'Flaviramia') have yellow stems.

Synonymous with and formerly known as Cornus stolonifera.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet from Latin means silky in reference to the hairs present on young twigs and upper leaf surfaces.
","
Problems
Susceptible to leaf and twig blights, canker and leaf spots. Scale, leaf miners and bagworms are occasional insect pests.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent massed or as a specimen. Effective in shrub borders where plants can be combined with evergreens or a contrasting color of redtwig dogwoods for interesting winter contrast. Also effective in naturalistic plantings in moist soils where plants can be allowed to spread and form thickets. Plants perform very well in wet locations such as low spots or along streams or ponds where spreading roots can help combat soil erosion. May also be used as a property line screen.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is best grown in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Tolerates drought once established. Cut foliage back to the ground in late winter. Clumps may be divided in late winter to early spring. This grass is technically gynodioecious, but usually appears dioecious. Female plants produce prodigious amounts of seed and can self-seed freely, often resulting in naturalization that displaces valuable native plants. This plant is considerably invasive in certain areas of the western U. S., particularly California and Hawaii where it is not now recommended for planting. In the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6), this grass will generally not survive winter, and should be planted in large containers (e.g., whiskey barrels) for overwintering in a greenhouse.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cortaderia selloana, commonly called pampas grass, is native to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Its common name is in obvious reference to the Argentine grasslands (the pampas) where it grows. It was planted around the world in Victorian times, and today is considered to be one of the most popular of the ornamental grasses. This is a tough, large grass that forms dense, substantial clumps (tussocks) featuring arching, serrulate, narrow green leaves that are topped in fall by huge, feathery, silvery white plumes. It was first introduced into the U. S. in 1848, and for many years now has been grown as an ornamental plant in certain southern and western parts of the U.S. It has also been grown commercially for harvest of its large flower plumes for use in dried arrangements. Leaf blades are extremely sharp (easily cut human skin) and may reach 6-8’ in length. Flower plumes (1-3’ long) may rise to 10-12’ tall on erect stems. Silvery white plumes (sometimes with traces of pink) are more impressive on female plants than on male plants.Genus name comes from the Argentinian name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Invasively self-seeds in some warm winter areas. Leaf edges are extremely sharp.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this is a large ornamental grass for large landscapes. Excellent specimen. Background plant for borders. Screen. Plumes may be cut and dried for use in indoor flower arrangements. Best grown in containers in the St. Louis area.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Corylus americana, commonly called American filbert or hazelnut, is a Missouri native, deciduous, rounded, multi-stemmed shrub which typically grows 8-16' tall and occurs statewide in dry or moist thickets, woodlands and wood margins, valleys, uplands and prairies. Monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same plant). In spring, male flowers appear in showy, 2-3"" long, yellowish brown catkins and female flowers appear in small, reddish, inconspicuous catkins. Female flowers give way to small, egg-shaped, 1/2"" long, edible nuts (maturing July-August) which are encased in leafy, husk-like, ragged-edged bracts. Nuts are similar in flavor to the European filbert, and may be roasted and eaten or ground into flour, but are also commonly left for the squirrels and birds. Ovate, double-toothed, dark green leaves (3-6"" long). Fall color is quite variable, ranging from attractive combinations of orange, rose, purplish red, yellow and green to undistinguished, dull yellowish green.Genus name comes from the Greek word korylos, or from korys meaning a helmet, in regard to the husk on the nut.Specific epithet means of the Americas, North or South.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spots, blight and crown gall. Occasional insect pests include scale, leafhoppers and various foliage-eating caterpillars.

Best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates average garden soils.  Avoid heavy clays.  Prompt removal of root suckers will help maintain plant appearance, and, if desired, help prevent thicket formation.  Plants may be propagated by suckers, early summer soft wood cuttings or seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Corylus avellana, commonly called European filbert, European hazelnut or cobnut, is a deciduous, thicket-forming,  multi-trunked, suckering shrub that typically grows to 12-20’ tall.  It is native to Europe, western Asia and northern Africa where it is typically found growing in rich thickets, woodland borders, wooded slopes, hedgerows, clearings and along streams.  

Monoecious flowers (separate male and female flowers on the same plant) bloom on bare branches in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves emerge.  Somewhat showy, pale yellow-gray male flowers appear in sessile drooping catkins (each to 2-3” long).  Inconspicuous female flowers with red stigmas bloom just above the male catkins.    Double serrate, elliptic to ovate to orbicular, medium green leaves (to 4” long) are rounded to cordate at the base and generally hairy.  Leaves turn variable but often unexceptional shades of yellow in fall.  Smooth light bark is gray-brown.  Fruit is a hard edible brown nut (to 3/4” long) enclosed in a leafy, hairy, light green husk.  Nuts are known as cobnuts.  Nuts appear in terminal clusters of 1-4 and are half covered in ragged husks.  The husk (involucral tube) surrounding the nut extends beyond the nut by at least one inch to form a beak.  Nuts ripen in late August and September.

In Europe, cultivars of this shrub are commercially grown for nut production.  Numerous cultivars exist.  In the U.S., Oregon is the center for nut production.  

The nuts from species plants may be roasted and eaten, but are less tasty than those found on developed cultivars and are usually left for the squirrels.Genus name comes from the Greek word korylos, or from korys meaning a helmet, in regard to the husk on the nut.Specific epithet comes from Avella Veccia (southern Italy) or of Avellino (city east of Naples where this plant was much cultivated and called nux Avellana by the Romans).Common names of filbert and hazelnut are likely interchangeable.  Hazelnut is more often used in reference to wild specimens and filbert is more likely to be used in reference to cultivated plants.  The filbert nuts produced in commerce primarily come from hybrid plants (C. avellana x C. maxima).
","
Problems
Reportedly has good resistance to filbert blight.  Infrequent disease problems include black knot, crown gall, apple mosaic virus, and leaf spot.  Scale may occur.  Japanese beetles may vigorously attack the foliage in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Straight species is effective in naturalized areas, group plantings, shrub borders or woodland margins.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Corylus colurna, commonly called Turkish hazel or Turkish filbert, is native from southeastern Europe to western Asia. It is a pyramidal deciduous tree that grows to 40-50’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. The trunk is short with dense, horizontal, low branching. Double-toothed, broad ovate to obovate, semi-glossy, bright green leaves (to 5” long) have hair on the veins beneath. Leaves turn variable but usually unexceptional shades of yellow in fall. Corky, mottled, tan to gray bark on mature trunks may flake to reveal an orange-brown inner bark. Monoecious flowers appear in catkins in spring. The male catkins (to 3” long) are not individually showy, but cumulatively can provide much interest in a March landscape. Tiny female catkins are largely hidden. Edible nuts appear in clusters of 3-6 with spiny and hairy involucre husks covering and extending beyond each nut. Nuts may be roasted and eaten, but are commonly left for the squirrels. This tree may be difficult to find in commerce. Other common names include Constantinople hazel and tree hazel. The filbert nuts produced in commerce come from hybrid plants (C. avellana x C. maxima).Genus name comes from the Greek word korylos, or from korys meaning a helmet, in regard to the husk on the nut.Specific epithet is the classical name of hazelnut.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics

Corylus cornuta, commonly called beaked hazel or beaked filbert, is native from British Columbia to Quebec south to Illinois and Georgia (with a variety occurring from British Columbia to California). It is a small, suckering, deciduous shrub that grows 4-8’ tall and as wide. It is typically found in rich thickets, woodland borders, along streams and in clearings. Female fruit is a hard edible nut (to 1/2” long) enclosed in a leafy, hairy, light green husk. As the common name suggests, the easiest way to identify this shrub is from the fruit: the husk (involucral tube) surrounding the nut extends beyond the nut by at least one inch to form a beak. Nuts ripen in late August and September. Doubly-toothed, elliptic to ovate, bright green leaves (to 4” long) are rounded (sometimes cordate) at the base and generally hairy. Leaves turn variable but usually unexceptional shades of yellow in fall. Non-showy, monoecious flowers appear in catkins in spring (April). The drooping, sessile male catkins are pale yellow-gray and the tiny female catkins with protruding red stigmas are largely concealed. The nuts from this plant may be roasted and eaten, but are usually left for the squirrels. The filbert nuts produced in commerce come from hybrid plants (C. avellana x C. maxima).Genus name comes from the Greek word korylos, or from korys meaning a helmet, in regard to the husk on the nut.Specific epithet means horned or horn-shaped.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cosmos bipinnatus, commonly just called cosmos, is native to Mexico. It is a popular, low-maintenance, late-blooming, showy annual that typically grows 2-4’ tall on erect stems clad with pinnatisect, medium green leaves that are deeply cut into threadlike segments. Single, saucer-shaped, daisy-like flowers (to 2-4” diameter) with red, pink or white rays and yellow centers bloom freely from early summer to frost. In hot and humid summer climates, plants may slow down considerably in late summer. Plants have escaped gardens and naturalized, particularly along roadsides, fields and waste areas, in many parts of the U. S. Cultivars feature single, semi-double or double flowers in a larger variety of colors including white and bicolor on plants ranging in height from dwarf to tall.Genus name comes from the Greek word kosmos meaning beautiful.Specific epithet refers to the plants bipinnate leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a wide range of soils except wet, poorly-drained ones.  Prefers somewhat infertile loams, but performs well in poor, rocky soils.  Sharp drainage is essential.  Plants have shallow fibrous root systems.  If bloom is desired, prune very lightly in early spring only as needed.  If bloom is not a concern, stems may be cut back hard in early spring to a framework to induce growth of vigorous new shoots with larger than normal leaves.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cotinus coggygria, commonly known as smoketree, is an upright, loose-spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that is native from southern Europe to central China.  It typically matures over time to 10-15’ tall and as wide.  It gets its common name of smoketree (or smokebush) not from the tiny, insignificant, yellowish flowers which appear in branching, terminal panicles (to 6-8” long) in spring, but from the billowy hairs (attached to elongated stalks on the spent flower clusters) which turn a smokey pink to purplish pink in summer, thus covering the tree with fluffy, hazy, smoke-like puffs throughout summer.  Bluish green leaves (to 3” long) are ovate to obovate.  Fall color is highly variable, but at its best produces attractive shades of yellow, orange, and purplish-red.Genus name comes from the Greek word kotinus meaning olive.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word kokkugia meaning smoke tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to leaf spot, rust and verticillium wilt.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cotinus obovatus, commonly called American smoketree, is a small, deciduous, rounded, Missouri native tree or large, upright shrub typically growing 20-30' tall and occurring on limestone glades, rocky limestone bluffs and bald knobs in the area of the White River in southeast Missouri. Smoketree gets its common name not from the 6-10"" flower clusters (tiny, insignificant, dioecious, yellowish-green flowers) which bloom in June, but from the billowy hairs (attached to elongated stalks on the spent flower clusters) which turn a smoky pink to purplish pink in summer, thus covering the tree with fluffy, hazy, smoke-like puffs. Bluish green leaves are, as the species name suggests, obovate. Foliage turns a variety of colors in the fall (including yellow, red, orange and reddish purple), and produces some of the best fall color of any of the native American trees and shrubs.Genus name comes from the Greek word kotinus meaning olive.Specific epithet means egg-shaped with the broadest end uppermost.

Culture
Best grown in moist, loamy, sharply-drained soils in full sun to part shade.   Requires little supplemental watering once established.  Prune to shape as needed (planting spreads and often becomes ragged over time).  Plants dislike hot summer conditions and often struggle south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cotoneaster dammeri, commonly called bearberry cotoneaster, is a dense, fast-growing, prostrate ground cover that grows to 1’ tall but spreads to 6’ wide or more on stiff, slender, prostrate branches that root at the nodes where they touch the ground.  It is native to mountain regions, cliff sides, open mixed forests and rocky ground in central to southern China.  Alternate, leathery, elliptic to oblong, mostly evergreen leaves (to 1 1/ 4” long and to 5/8” wide) are glossy deep green above and gray-green below.  Leaves acquire reddish-bronze to purple tones in winter.  White, 5-petaled, 1/2” diameter flowers with purple anthers bloom singly or in pairs in May-June.  Flowers are followed by red berries (pomes to 1-4” wide) which ripen in late summer but persist through winter unless consumed by birds or animals.  Berry crop is often small.Genus name comes from the Latin words cotoneum meaning quince and -aster meaning resembling.Specific epithet honors Carl Lebrecht Dammer (1860-1920), German botanist at the Botanical Museum in Berlin.Common name of bearberry cotoneaster is in reference to the fact that bears will feed on the berries in winter in parts of the U.S.‘Coral Beauty’ is a cultivar which is primarily distinguished from species plants by having: (1) more compact habit; (2) leaves a bit shinier; and (3) more abundant fruit crop.  ‘Coral Beauty’ is sometimes sold under the synonymous cultivar names of ‘Royal Beauty’ and 'Pink Beauty’. RHS Award of Garden Merit in 1993.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to fireblight, leaf spots and canker. Watch for aphids, cotoneaster webworm and lacebugs.  Mites may appear, particularly in hot and dry conditions.  Dense foliage can present maintenance problems because of the difficulty of cleaning dead leaves and trash from the interior of a planting.
","
Garden Uses
Creeping cotoneaster is a valuable landscape plant that offers good foliage, flowers and fruit.  Mass as a woody ground cover for sunny areas in the landscape including banks and slopes where it can also provide some erosion control.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12 where it is best grown in organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Intolerant of frost.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Couroupita guianensis, commonly known as cannonball tree, is a soft-wooded, deciduous tropical tree of the Brazil nut family that typically matures to 50-75’ (infrequently to 100’) tall.  It is primarily native to rainforests in the Guianas (French Guiana, Suriname and Guyana) in northeastern South America, but has been widely planted in a number of different tropical to semi-tropical areas around the world.  The common name is in reference to the unusual, bordering-on-the bizarre, woody, globose, hard-shelled, reddish-brown fruits of this tree which mature to a cannonball size of 8-10” in diameter.  On windy days, the fruits often bang against each other on the tree creating a sound reportedly resembling a cannonade.  Each fruit contains 200-300 seeds which are embedded in an ill-smelling, soft red pulp which turns bluish-green when exposed to air.  Each fruit typically takes 1 year or more to mature.  When ripe, fruits drop from the tree, usually splitting open as they hit the ground with an explosive splat.   

Large, pleasantly fragrant, rose-pink to red flowers (each to 4-5” across) bloom in racemes.  Each flower has a 6-lobed calyx and 6 spreading petals which encircle two types of stamens (fertile stamens and sterile staminoides) which are borne on a cream-colored androphore.  Each individual flower blooms for only one day.  Flowers and subsequent fruits are located on drooping, naked, thick, tangled, vine-like stems (extrusions to 2-6’ long) which emerge directly from the trunk and large branches.  Old trees often have the lower parts of their trunks completely covered with dangling flower racemes and fruits. 

Simple, elliptic to ovate to oblong leaves (6-8” long) are primarily clustered near the branch ends.  Leaves are alternate or in apical whorls.  Leaf margins are entire or finely serrate.  Veins on leaf undersides are pubescent.  Leaves typically drop once, but sometimes twice, per year, usually in response to dry weather, hence the designation of deciduous for this tropical tree.Genus name is a modification of the name of a native tree used in Tropical America.Specific epithet is in reference to the Guianas where this tree is native.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Mature fruits release a fetid aroma when they drop to the ground and break open.  Foot traffic should not be permitted under the drip-line of this tree because falling fruit can seriously injure or kill human beings.  Trees grown in public places often have warning signs about falling fruit.
","
Garden Uses
Plant as a curiosity in tropical gardens in areas where there will be minimal foot traffic under the tree when the ripened fruits are dropping.

Culture
Best grown in rich, sandy to gravelly, neutral to alkaline, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Established plants tolerate some drought.  Although native habitat is maritime conditions above the high water mark, this perennial adapts well to borders and vegetable gardens.  Add lime to the soils as needed to maintain neutral/alkaline character.  Propagate by seed or root cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crambe maritime, commonly known as sea kale, is a robust mustard family perennial that typically grows in a spreading basal mound to 30-36” tall and to 24-30” wide.  It is native to coastal sea shore areas of Europe from the north Atlantic through the Mediterranean to Asia Minor and around the Black Sea.  It is grown for ornamental purposes (attractive blue-green foliage and white flowers) and/or as a vegetable (edible leaves, stems, flowers and roots).  Large, fleshy, glaucous, shallowly-lobed, ovate-oblong, wavy-edged, basal leaves (to 2’ long) resemble the leaves found on collards and cabbages which are in the same family.  Leaves are the main ornamental attraction.  Leaf mound is covered in June-July by a profuse bloom of small, fragrant, 4-petaled white flowers (to 1/2” wide) in dense panicles (corymbose racemes).  Flowers are followed by almost spherical pea-like seed pods to 1/4” wide.  Each pod has one seed. 

Sea kale is a popular vegetable in parts of Europe (particularly England and France), but has never caught on in the U. S.  Shoots are typically cut in spring when 8” long, blanched, steamed and eaten (like asparagus).  Young leaves may be eaten raw or cooked (like spinach).  Flower buds may be eaten raw or cooked (like broccoli).  Roots may also be eaten raw or cooked (boiled or steamed).   

RHS Award of Garden Merit in 2002.Genus name comes from the Greek word krambh which was the name of a cabbage-like plant in ancient Greece.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word maritimus which means growing by the sea in reference to the native habitat of this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs and cabbage moth caterpillars in some areas.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils as long as drainage is good. Tolerates light shade and some drought. Tolerates many urban pollutants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus crus-galli, commonly called cockspur thorn, is sometimes seen as a dense, low-branched, broad-rounded tree to 25-35’ with horizontal branching armed with numerous large thorns (1.5-3” long).  Lower branches often sweep near to the ground.  It is also often seen as a tall, flat-topped shrub.  It is native from Quebec to North Carolina and Kansas.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in thickets and rocky pastures throughout the state (Steyermark).  Obovate to oblong-obovate dark green leaves (to 3” long) have wedge-shaped bases.  Foliage turns orange to scarlet to purple red in fall.  White flowers (in corymbs to 3”) bloom in May for a period of 7-10 days.  Flowers emit an unpleasant fragrance.  Flowers are followed by rounded fruits (3/8” diameter) that ripen to deep red in fall (September-October) and typically  persist to late fall.  Fruits are technically edible, but are usually best left for the birds.  The fruit is sometimes called a haw.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Crus-galli in Latin means leg of a cock in reference to the purported resemblance of the thorns of this plant to a cock’s spurs.  The specific epithet of this plant is sometimes also designated as crusgalli.The white hawthorn blossom (Crataegus) is the Missouri State Flower.
","
Problems
Pests and diseases are a problem with most hawthorns. Plants are susceptible to cedar-hawthorn and cedar-quince rusts (rust stage where eastern red cedars are present in the area) and fireblight.  Other potential diseases include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers, apple scab, leaf blight and twig blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale. Red spider mites may also occur. Use of pesticide sprays may be advisable in areas where this plant suffers from significant diseases and insects. On species plants, numerous thorns pose significant risks for young children and also make culture/pruning more difficult.
","
Garden Uses
Small flowering landscape tree for lawns or open woodland areas. Notwithstanding disease susceptibility, a well-maintained tree can be ornamentally attractive. On species plants, thorns are a drawback for pedestrian areas or areas with small children. Plants may be effective when grown as barrier plants on property borders or in hedgerows.

Culture
Grow in moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist soils, but also tolerates drier upland soils.  Best fruit production occurs in full sun.  Prune if necessary in late winter.  Will sucker to form thickets.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus douglasii, commonly known as black hawthorn, typically matures over time as a small upright tree to 20-30' tall featuring dense clusters of white flowers in spring, edible fruits that mature to black in late summer and a spreading rounded crown of branches (young twigs red) clad with attractive green leaves and sharp thorns.   It also sometimes grows as a much shorter bushy thicket-forming shrub.  It is native to wetlands, open moist places, bluffs and slopes, meadows, ditches and along streams in a large geographic territory extending from Alaska to Quebec south to Michigan, South Dakota, Nevada and California, but within such territory is most commonly found in the Pacific Northwest.  Fragrant, five-petaled, white flowers (to 1/2"" diameter) with cup-shaped bases bloom in flat-topped clusters (10-12 flowered corymbs) rising from the leaf axils and branch ends in mid to late spring (May-early June).  Flowers have an unpleasant fragrance which tends to attract pollinators such as midges and butterflies.  Flowers are followed by abundant, globular, red fruits (to 1/2"" diameter) which ripen to black in late summer.  Fruits are edible and commonly called haws.  Fruits usually drop to the ground in late fall, but may persist on the tree in a shriveled raisin-like form.  Shiny, sometimes mildly lobed, leathery, ovate to obovate leaves (to 3-5"" long) with saw-toothed margins (primarily above the leaf midpoint) are dark green above and pale green underneath.    Fall color is usually insignificant, but sometimes surprises with showy tones of red, orange and yellow.  Branches are armed with stout spines to 1"" long.  Rough scaly gray bark develops on older trees.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Specific epithet is in reference to Scottish botanist David Douglas (1798-1834) who discovered this plant in his North American explorations (Douglas fir is also named after him).The name hawthorn comes from an Anglo-Saxon word haguthorn which means fence with thorns.

Crataegus is a large genus containing over 200 species.
","
Problems
Cedar-hawthorn rust, cedar-quince rust, fireblight, fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers and apple scab are occasional problems.  Insect pests include borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale.  Falling fruit can create clean-up problems in fall.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Best grown in moist but well-drained soils in full sun. This tree generally does not grow well in the hot and humid St. Louis summer climate where untreated fungal leaf spot and rust can severely disfigure the foliage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus laevigata, commonly called English hawthorn, is native to Europe and North Africa. It is a small, low-branching, deciduous tree that is noted for its profuse spring bloom. It typically grows 15-20’ tall with a rounded crown. Straight to zigzag, thorny stems are clad with 3 to 5-lobed, dark green leaves (to 2 1/2” long). No fall color. White 5-petaled flowers in clusters (corymbs) bloom in mid spring. Flowers are followed by red fruits (pomes to 1/2” long) in fall. Many cultivars of English hawthorn, some featuring double flowers, are available in commerce today with flower colors including pink, rose, red and white. The species is rarely sold. The fruit is sometimes called a haw. The word haw also means hedge, the hawthorn being a thorny hedge. In the 1800s, English hawthorn was widely planted in England as a hedgerow plant because of its thorns.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Specific epithet means smooth.
","
Problems
Hawthorns are susceptible to a large number of insect and disease problems. Cedar-apple rust and fungal leaf spot can be quite damaging to the foliage. Powdery mildew, fire blight, cankers and apple scab may also occur. Insect pests include borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale.
","
Garden Uses
Small flowering landscape tree. May also be pruned as a hedge.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils as long as drainage is good. Tolerates light shade and some drought. Tolerates many urban pollutants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus nitida, commonly called glossy hawthorn or shining hawthorn, is native to a small area of the Midwest consisting of southern Illinois south to western Tennessee and northeast Arkansas. In Missouri, it mostly occurs along streams and in open woods near the Mississippi River (Steyermark). It is a small, dense, broad-rounded tree to 20-30’ tall. It is also seen as a large multi-stemmed shrub. Branching is usually armed with thorns (to 2” long) with lower branching being horizontal and upper branching being more erect. Coarsely toothed, elliptic to oblong-ovate dark green leaves (to 3” long) have pointed tips and are sometimes lobed near the top. Leaves turn orange to red in fall. White flowers (in corymbs) bloom in May. Flowers emit an unpleasant fragrance. Flowers are followed by rounded fruits (3/8” diameter) that ripen to dull red in September-October and typically persist throughout winter to spring. Fruits are technically edible, but are usually best left for the birds. The fruit is sometimes called a haw.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Specific epithet means shining in reference to the glossy leaves.
","
Problems
Pests and diseases are a problem with most hawthorns. Plants are susceptible to cedar hawthorn rust (rust stage where eastern red cedars are present in the area) and fireblight. Other potential diseases include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers, apple scab, leaf blight and twig blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale. Red spider mites may also occur. Use of pesticide sprays may be advisable in areas where this plant suffers from significant diseases and insects. Thorns pose significant risks for young children, and also make culture/pruning more difficult.
","
Garden Uses
Small flowering landscape tree for lawns or open woodland areas. Notwithstanding disease susceptibility, a well-maintained tree can be ornamentally attractive. Thorns are a drawback for pedestrian areas or areas with small children. Plants may be effective when grown as barrier plants on property borders or in hedgerows.

Culture
Best grown in moist but well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus phaenopyrum, commonly called Washington hawthorn, is native to Missouri where it is primarily found in open ground, thickets and wood margins in the Ozark region of the state (Steyermark). It is noted for its attractive flowers and foliage, bright red fruits and fall color. It is a small, low-branching, deciduous tree that typically grows 25-30’ tall with a rounded crown. Thorny stems are clad with shallowly lobed, serrate, glossy dark green leaves (to 2 1/2” long). Leaves turn attractive shades of orange and red in fall. Fragrant, 5-petaled, white flowers in clusters (corymbs) bloom in late spring. Flowers are followed in fall by bright red 1/4” diameter globose fruits (pomes) that persist throughout the winter. The fruit is sometimes called a haw. The word haw also means hedge, the hawthorn thus being a thorny hedge. Washington hawthorn is native from Virginia to Missouri, Arkansas and Alabama.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Specific epithet comes from Greek meaning resembling a pear, in probable reference to the flowers.Washington hawthorn reportedly was first grown commercially near Washington, D.C. in the late 1700s, hence the common name.
","
Problems
Washington hawthorn shows good resistance to cedar-apple rust. Fire blight, fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers and apple scab are occasional problems. Insect pests include borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale.
","
Garden Uses
Small flowering landscape tree for lawns or streets. Specimen, small groups or screen. May be pruned as a hedge.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus punctata is a small, slender-spined, deciduous tree or large shrub that is native to eastern North America. As a tree, it typically grows to 25-30' tall with horizontal branching and a broad-rounded (almost flat-topped) crown. It is sometimes commonly called dotted hawthorn because its red fruits (haws) are speckled with white dots. Stout spines extend to 3"" long. Fragrant, five-petaled, white flowers (to 1/2"" across) bloom in showy, multi-flowered clusters (corymbs) in spring (May-early June). Flowers are followed by abundant, globular, red fruits (to 3/4"" diameter) with conspicuous white dots. Fruits ripen in fall and may persist on the tree into winter, but usually drop to the ground in late fall. Slightly lobed, obovate, dark green leaves (to 3"" long) have serrate margins above the middle. Leaves sometimes produce showy red fall color. The fruits of hawthorn trees are sometimes called haws.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Specific epithet means dotted in reference to the fruit.'Ohio Pioneer' is an essentially spineless version that was discovered in 1962 growing at the Secrest Arboretum Nursery in Wooster, Ohio.
","
Problems
Cedar hawthorn rust, fire blight, fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers and apple scab are occasional problems. Insect pests include borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale. Falling fruit can create clean-up problems in fall.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade and drought. Moist, rich, fertile soils may encourage unwanted succulent growth. Tolerant of urban pollution.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus viridis, commonly called green hawthorn, is native to the southeastern U.S. from Virginia to Florida west to Texas and up the Mississippi River valley to Illinois. In Missouri, it primarily occurs in low wet grounds and along streams in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the state. It is a dense, rounded, largely spineless tree that typically grows 20-35’ tall with a broad spreading crown. Gray stems are clad with serrate, ovate to elliptic, glossy dark green leaves (to 3 1/2” long) that are shallowly lobed in the upper half. When present, thorns grow to 1 1/2” long. Leaves turn purple to red in fall. Fragrant, 5-petaled, white flowers in 2-inch clusters (corymbs) bloom in May. Flowers are followed by small red fruits (pomes) that ripen in September and usually persist on the tree well into winter. Fruits are technically edible, but are usually best left for the birds. The fruit is sometimes called a haw. The fruit may be harvested to make jelly. Bark on mature trunks exfoliates to reveal orange inner bark.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Specific epithet means green.
","
Problems
One of the most disease-resistant hawthorns. As with most hawthorns, there is some susceptibility to cedar hawthorn rust (rust stage where eastern red cedars are present in the area) and fireblight. Fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers and apple scab are occasional problems. Insect pests include borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent spring flowering tree for lawns and streets. Good fall color and persistent fruit help provide year round interest. Pollution tolerance makes it a good candidate for urban plantings.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12.  Best in warm, humid, tropical climates.  Thrives in humus, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun or part shade, but will tolerate some drought when not bearing fruit.  Pruning is seldom needed.  Propagate from seed or cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crescentia cujete, commonly known as calabash tree, is a small tropical evergreen tree of the Bignonia family that grows to 30’ tall.  Original native territory is unclear, but probably extends from Mexico through Central America to Brazil plus the Caribbean.  It is found today primarily in forest margins, thickets and roadsides.   It has been introduced over time in many tropical areas around the world.  It has naturalized in India.  It is particularly noted for its (a) paddle-shaped green leaves (to 10” long), (b) tubular flowers (tubes to 2” long) which are light yellowish-brown with flaring lobes and purple interiors, and (c) large, spherical, gourd-like, yellow-green fruits (each to 8-12” diameter).  Flowers and fruits are both cauliflorus (borne directly on the branches and trunk).  Trees typically bloom and fruit throughout the year.  It takes about 6 months for a fruit to grow and ripen.  Flowers appear singly or in small clusters, have a strong somewhat unpleasant aroma, and are pollinated by bats.  Fruits mature to the size of a soccer ball, have a tough woody shell containing a pulpy flesh, and are often hollowed out and used as containers.  Fruits are also used to make maracas.  Long history of herbal medicinal uses.Genus name honors Italian author Pietro Crescenzi (1230-1321).Specific epithet is a Brazilian name for this species.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-11.  Bulbs are easily grown in moist to wet, organically rich soils in full sun to light shade.  Will also grow in standing water to 6” deep.  Although this is a wetland plant in its native habitat, it performs well in moderately moist soils in garden settings.  Winter temperatures determine best planting strategy:  
(A) Where winter hardy, plant bulbs in a moist soil in spring for year round outdoor growth.  Plants will often spread over time to form large colonies.  (B) Where marginally winter hardy, plant bulbs in a protected location (e.g., southern exposure) in moist soils in spring for year round outdoor growth and mulch with evergreen boughs, hay or leaves over winter.  (C) Where not winter hardy, plants are usually grown in containers which are planted outdoors in spring after last spring frost date and then dug up and brought indoors prior to the first fall frost date for overwintering in a cool sun room.  Plant bulbs in pots/containers that are at least two inches larger in diameter than the bulbs.  Bulbs like to be pot-bound.  Set bulb in the pot with the neck exposed.  Keep soils moist to wet and fertilize regularly during the growing season.  Bring containers inside in fall before first frost for overwintering in a frost-free location.  Return containers to the garden after last spring frost date.  

Although plants can technically be grown directly in the ground (as opposed to in pots) in St. Louis by planting the bulbs in late spring and lifting the bulbs in fall in somewhat the same manner as for dahlias, this is generally not considered good practice because crinum roots do not like to be disturbed and once disturbed plants may not bloom for another 2-3 years.  It should be noted that some gardeners have been able to successfully grow crinum hybrids year round in the ground as far north as Zone 6 with a good winter mulch and protected location, however the risk of loss is ever present.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crinum americanum, commonly called Florida crinum lily, southern swamp lily or spider lily, is a tender perennial bulb in the Amaryllis family.  It is native to wetlands, swamps, marshes, wet hammocks, and streambanks from South Carolina to Florida and along the Gulf coast to Texas.  

Fragrant, white (sometimes blushed pink), lily-like flowers (each to 4” wide and long) in 2-6 flowered umbels bloom summer to fall atop leafless scapes rising to 2-3’ tall from a clump of narrow, evergreen, strap-shaped leaves (to 2” wide and to 1-2’ long).  Each flower has spreading petals to 1/2” wide and stamens with pink to red stalks.  Crinum bulbs are large (to 3-4” diameter) with tapered necks.Genus name comes from the Greek word krinon meaning lily.Specific epithet is in reference to the native American habitat of this lily.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11.  Bulbs are easily grown in consistently moist, organically rich, fertile soils in full sun to light shade.  This plant is fairly tolerant of brief periods of drought.  Freezing temperatures in winter will kill the foliage of this evergreen plant.  Winter temperatures determine best planting strategy:   (A) Where winter hardy, plant bulbs in a moist soil in spring for year round outdoor growth.  Plants will spread over time to form large colonies.  (B) Where marginally winter hardy, plant bulbs in a protected location (e.g., southern exposure) in moist soils in spring for year round outdoor growth and mulch with evergreen boughs, hay or leaves over winter.  (C) Where not winter hardy, plants are usually grown in containers which are planted outdoors in spring after last spring frost date and then dug up and brought indoors prior to the first fall frost date for overwintering in a cool sun room.  Plant bulbs in pots/containers that are at least two inches larger in diameter than the bulbs.  Bulbs like to be pot-bound.  Set each bulb in a pot with the neck exposed.  Keep soils moist and fertilize regularly during the growing season.  Bring containers inside in fall before first frost for overwintering in a frost-free location.  Return containers to the garden after last spring frost date.  Propagate by offsets, division or seed.  Outdoor plants spread in the garden by suckers to form substantial clumps.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Crinum asiaticum, commonly called giant crinum, is a tender perennial bulb in the amaryllis family.  It is native to tropical southeastern Asia, but has been widely cultivated in tropical to subtropical areas around the world.  It has escaped cultivation and naturalized in parts of Florida, Louisiana and California.

Fragrant, long-tubed, 6-petaled, lily-like flowers (each to 4” wide and long) with tubular corollas bloom summer to fall (sometimes year-round in warm winter locations) in large umbels (each having 20-30 flowers) atop thick leafless succulent scapes rising from the foliage clump to 4-6’ tall.  Flowers are white, but sometimes are striped with red or tinged with purple.  Each flower has six long protruding stamens with red filaments.  Strap-shaped, parallel-veined, evergreen leaves (each to 4’ long and to 5” wide) form a spreading basal clump.  Crinum bulbs are huge (10-25 pounds each) with tapered necks.Genus name comes from the Greek word krinon meaning lily.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant being native to Asia.

Culture
Bulbs are easily grown in organically rich, moist, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. This species has tolerance for soggy soils. North of Zone 6, plants are often grown in large containers placed in the ground and then brought inside in winter. South of Zone 6, plants may be grown in the ground year round. In Zone 6 (St. Louis), plants may be grown in containers or planted outdoors year round in protected locations with winter mulch. When using containers, plant bulbs in pots/containers that are at least two inches larger in diameter than the bulbs. Bulbs like to be pot-bound. Set bulb in pot with the neck exposed. Keep soils moist and fertilize regularly during the growing season. After bloom, slightly reduce watering. Bring containers inside in fall before first frost for overwintering in a cool, dry, frost-free location. Increase watering in spring as plant shows signs of new growth. It should be noted that C. bulbispermum has the best winter hardiness of the crinums. Some gardeners have been able to successfully grow this crinum year round in the ground in Zone 6 (St. Louis), however the risk of loss is present. Where winter hardiness is a concern, some gardeners plant the bulbs in late spring and lift them in fall in somewhat the same manner as for dahlias. However, this procedure is generally not considered to be good practice because crinum roots do not like to be disturbed and once disturbed plants may not bloom for another 2-3 years. Plants have been introduced to and naturalized in certain parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crinum bulbispermum is a tender perennial bulb in the Amaryllis family. The species is native to wet marginal areas of South Africa, including the Orange River valley from which it derives its sometimes used common name of Orange River lily. In addition to river banks, it is also native to wet marshes and to swampy areas that dry out in winter. Lily-like, trumpet-shaped flowers bloom in clusters (8-13 flowered umbels) in mid-spring atop scapes (to 2-3’ tall) rising above a clump of strap-shaped blue-green leaves. Plants may rebloom in early fall. Each flower (to 4” long) is white flushed with pink with a red stripe down the center of each petal. Flowers are fragrant.Genus name comes from the Greek word krinon meaning lily.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in gritty, well-drained soils. Avoid heavy clay soils, poorly-drained soils or overly moist soil conditions. Plants do best in climates with long, dry summers. Plant corms about 2-4” deep and 3-4” apart in late summer to early fall (September). Plants are sterile and do not produce viable seed. Divide corms to propagate.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crocus sativus, commonly called saffron crocus, is a fall-blooming crocus from which the spice saffron is harvested. Although cultivated since ancient times, the native habitat of this crocus is unknown. Saffron crocus may have first appeared in Greece as a sterile triploid form that was selected from C. cartwrightianus. Saffron crocus is commercially grown today in a number of locations, but primarily from Spain to Italy to Greece to Iran to India, with almost 80% of world production coming from Spain and Iran. It is also grown ornamentally as an attractive fall bloomer. It typically grows to 4-6” tall. Each corm produces several upright, cup-like, lilac-purple flowers that bloom in early to mid-autumn for about 1-2 weeks. Each flower has three long style branches tipped with reddish-orange stigmas. The stigmas often protrude beyond the petal cup. It takes about 1/4 million stigmas (75,000 flowers) to produce one pound of saffron which in large part explains why saffron is the most expensive spice regularly sold in commerce today. Flowers close at night and open up in the morning, but usually remain closed on rainy/cloudy days. Basal, grass-like leaves appear slightly prior to bloom. Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron with pink flowers and 6 stamens) also blooms in autumn, but is very poisonous.
","
Problems
Squirrels, mice and other rodents can be problems. Squirrels seem particularly adept at locating, digging up and eating newly planted corms.
","
Garden Uses
Brings attractive ornamental fall bloom to the landscape. Large sweeping drifts can be spectacular. Plants also may be grouped in beds, borders, rock gardens, herb gardens, in front of shrubs, along walks or in various other small areas around the home. For culinary purposes, stigmas may be removed from flowers with tweezers, dried and then stored in air-tight containers for later use as saffron, but the harvest amount from a large mass of flowers is disappointingly small. Saffron is a prized ingredient in a number of classic dishes including risotto, rice, paella and bouillabaisse.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Crocus tommasinianus is native to hillsides and woodland areas from southern Hungary into the northern Balkans.  It is commonly called snow crocus because it is one of the earliest of the crocuses to bloom.  Pale lavender to reddish-purple, long-tubed, goblet-shaped flowers with white throats bloom in late winter to early spring (March in St. Louis) on plants rising to 4"" tall.  Bloom typically occurs before the bloom of the Dutch hybrid crocuses.  Each plant has 3-5 basal, narrow, linear leaves at the time of bloom.  Flowers close at night and open up in the morning, but usually remain closed on rainy/cloudy days.Genus name comes from krokos the ancient Greek name for saffron (Crocus sativus.)

Noteworthy Characteristics
Croton alabamensis, commonly called Alabama croton, is a rare, semi-evergreen to deciduous, loose-rounded, thicket-forming, multi-stemmed shrub that is only found today in four central Alabama counties plus in three counties in Texas under the name of Croton alabamensis var. texensis with the common name of Texabama croton.  A former small population in one county in Tennessee may be extirpated. 

This rare plant typically grows to 6-10’ tall and as wide.  Alternate, simple, apple-green (green to olive green), semi-evergreen, oblong to ovate leaves (2-4” long) have some silvery scales above but are silvery white below.  Older leaves turn orange-red in fall.  Leaves are noted for their oval shape, glistening silver scales beneath and stunning pumpkin-orange fall color.  Leaves remain on the shrub in mild winter climates with green to orange color.  Crushed leaves have a banana-apple fragrance.  Greenish-yellow flowers bloom in early spring (March –April) at the twig ends in racemes (to 2” long).  Fruit is a drupe. 

This shrub is a member of the spurge family as evidenced by the milky sap and poinsettia-like flower clusters. 

Croton alabamensis is federally listed as G3 or globally vulnerable and var. texensis is listed on the endangered watch list.Genus name is the Greek word for the castor oil plant (genus Ricinus) which is in the same family as this plant.  Genus name means a tick in reference to the plant seeds resembling ticks.Specific epithet means the plant is native to Alabama.

Problems

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cryptomeria japonica, commonly called Japanese cedar or sugi, is a slender, pyramidal, evergreen conifer with tiered horizontal branching, which is slightly pendulous at the tips.  Japanese cedar is a monotypic genus unrelated to the true cedars (Cedrus).  It is native to forested areas in Japan and China where it typically grows as a single trunk tree to 150’ tall (infrequently taller) with an 8’ trunk diameter.  It is the national tree of Japan where it is often planted at temples and shrines.  In cultivation in the U.S., it grows much smaller, more typically to 50-60’ tall.  Sharply-pointed, awl-shaped, fragrant, green to blue-green needles (to 3/4” long) are spirally arranged.  Foliage is soft to the touch.  Foliage may bronze in cold winters.  Spherical fruiting cones (to 1” diameter) appear at the shoot ends.  Reddish-brown bark exfoliates in strips.  

This is a prized timber tree in its native habitat. 

Compact and dwarf cultivars are commonly sold in commerce.Genus name comes from the Greek krypto meaning to hide and meris meaning a part in reference to the flower parts being hidden.Specific epithet means of Japan.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf blight and leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Species trees as a large specimen tree. Screen. Dwarf cultivars make good rock garden plants.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cryptotaenia canadensis, commonly called honewort, wild chervil or umbelweed, is a tuberous-rooted herbaceous perennial of the parsley/carrot family that typically grows to 1-3’ tall.  It is noted for producing trifoliate leaves and compound umbels of tiny white flowers in summer.  It is native primarily to woodland areas from Quebec to Manitoba south to Texas and Florida where it is typically found growing in moist forests, rich woods, ravines, wooded valleys and along streams, ledges and bluffs.  Leaves (3-6” long) are palmately divided into three elliptic to ovate leaflets with sharply toothed margins.  Tiny 5-petaled white flowers (1/8” long) which lack visible sepals bloom in terminal and axillary compound umbels from June to September.  Flowers are somewhat characteristic of the flowers typically produced by members of the carrot/parsley family.  Flowers give way to blackish, oblong, ribbed fruits.  

Young stems and leaves may be added fresh to salads (like parsley) as a flavoring or may be boiled as a green.  Gives a parsley-like flavor to soup.  Roots can be cooked and eaten like parsnips.  Seeds can be used as a spice.

This species is a host plant for the black swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek word cryptos meaning hidden and tainia meaning band, ribbon or fillet in probable reference to oil tubes hidden or concealed in the fruits.Specific epithet means Canadian.Common name of honewort is used to describe several different species of plants in the parsley/carrot family.  Wort means plant and hone is a swelling in the cheek which honewort plants purportedly will cure.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cryptotaenia japonica, commonly called Japanese parsley, Japanese honeywort or mitsuba, is an herbaceous perennial with foliage that somewhat resembles a flat-leaved parsley.  It is native to moist woodland areas and ditches in eastern Asia.   Branching stems of ternate compound leaves (mitsuba means three leaves in Japanese) with serrated ovate segments (each to 2-4"" long) typically grow in an upright clump to 12-18"" tall and as wide.  Small white flowers in umbels bloom in summer on stems rising about 6"" above the foliage.  Seeds ripen in August-September.  Plants are frequently used as culinary herbs in Asian cuisine.  Leaves and stems are considered to have a parsley/celery-like flavor and may be added to soups, salads or other hot/cold dishes as a flavoring and/or garnish.  Roots can be blanched and sauteed.  

Forma atropurpurea plants have ruffled purple-black foliage and stems which contribute significant ornamental interest to garden areas.  Umbels of light pink to purple flowers bloom above the foliage in midsummer bringing plant height to 24"" tall.  Leaves typically lose sharp color intensity as the summer progresses.  Culinary uses are the same as for species plants.  Very closely related to Cryptotaenia japonica is the North American species Cryptotaenia canadensis, which is native from Quebec to Manitoba south to Georgia and Texas.  In Missouri, it is found in rocky woods, ravines, valleys and along streams and bluff ledges throughout the State (Steyermark).Genus name comes from the Greek word cryptos meaning hidden and tainia meaning band, ribbon or fillet in probable reference to oil tubes hidden or concealed in the fruits.Specific epithet means of Japan.

Culture
Easily grown in loose, fertile, medium-textured, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun.  Plants perform best in full sun.  Plants are typically grown as annuals in cages, on trellises or, space permitting, along the ground.  Vertical growth on a trellis may be best for var. flexuosus because the fruits will grow straighter with less curvature.  Plants are intolerant of frost.  Plant seeds outdoors in the garden at the last spring frost date or indoors in pots or other containers about 4-6 weeks prior to the last spring frost date.  Plants thrive in hot summer daytime weather with warm nights.  Pick fruits when young (older fruits toughen as they mature).   Consistent and even moisture is essential.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cucumis melo, commonly called muskmelon or sweet melon, is a scabrid or hispid, scrambling or climbing, annual or perennial plant of the gourd family.  Common name is in reference to the musky smell which emanates from many of the fruits in the species when cut open.  The fruits in this species vary considerably in terms of shape, size, rind, texture, flavor and flesh color.  This is a polymorphic taxon that produces not only edible muskmelons (straight species) but also six different edible varieties or groups (some experts prefer the term group because variety only applies to plants in the wild) as follows:  (1) var. cantalupensis (cantaloupe developed at Cantalupi near Rome), (2) var. inodorous (winter melons including casaba and honeydew), (3) var. reticulatus (netted or musk melon with netted rind and musky sweet orange flesh), (4) var. conomon (oriental pickling melon), (5) var. chito group (mango melons), (6) var. dudaim (stink melon or Queen Anne’s pocket melon), and (7) var. flexuosus (Armenian cucumber, snake or serpent melon with cucumber shape and appearance).

Var. flexuosus (aka flexuosus group), most commonly called Armenian cucumber, is a frost-tender, tendril bearing annual vine that is grown for harvest of its edible, long and slender, cucumber-like fruits consumed as a vegetable.  Vines will typically grow to 6-9’ long.  This is an heirloom plant first cultivated in the 1400s in western Asia from Armenia and Turkey south along the eastern Mediterranean to Egypt.  Although botanically a muskmelon, this fruit looks and tastes like a cucumber.  The cucumber that is most commonly grown for culinary consumption is the closely related Cucumis sativus.  

In frost-free climates, yellow flowers with 5-parted corollas bloom throughout much of the year.  Flowers give way to slender fruits with greenish-white flesh and thin corrugated pale green rinds.  Fruits are best harvested when young (e.g. about 12” long and 1” diameter), but will mature to as much as 36” long (hence the sometimes used common name of yard-long cucumber).  Fruits can be eaten without peeling.  Fruit flesh becomes drier and tougher as fruits mature.  Stems are clad with rounded, wavy margined, rough-pubescent, shallowly and irregularly lobed leaves (to 6” across).Genus name from Latin means cucumber as derived from the Greek word kykyon also meaning cucumber.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word melopepo meaning apple-shaped melon.
","
Problems
Watch for cucumber beetles which feed on the foliage and transmit diseases.  Aphids and spider mites may be troublesome.  Wilt, downy mildew, powdery mildew, anthracnose, stem blight, scab and leaf spot may occur.  Mosaic virus is a potential problem in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Not commonly grown in the U.S.  Fruits may harvested for use in a variety of ways including  raw in salads, pasta salads, pickled, sliced, stir fried and in soups.

Culture
Easily grown in loose, fertile, medium textured, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants perform best in full sun. Grow plants in cages, on trellises or, space permitting, along the ground. Plants are intolerant of frost. Plant seeds in the garden at the last spring frost date. Plant seed 1"" deep in rows 4-6' apart or plants in hills about 4-6' apart. In the alternative, seed may be started indoors in pots or other containers about 4-6 weeks before last spring frost date. Plants thrive in hot summer daytime weather with warm nights. Pick fruits when young (older cucumbers toughen as they develop large seeds). Consistent and even moisture is essential.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cucumis sativus, commonly called cucumbers, are annual, tendril-bearing vines of the gourd family that are commonly grown both commercially and in home vegetable gardens throughout the world for harvest of edible fruits. Plants are originally native to southern Asia. For home gardens, select cultivars to be grown by expected growth habit, fruit type/size, flowering habit and disease resistance. Size varies from small gherkin types to long slicing varieties. Varieties are monoecious (both male and female flowers), gynoecious (female flowers) or parthenocarpic (self-fertile female flowers). Some varieties grow best as vines and others as bushy plants.Genus name from Latin means cucumber as derived from the Greek word kykyon also meaning cucumber.Specific epithet means cultivated.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cucurbita maxima is a squash native to subtropical areas of South America (Argentina-Bolivia-Uruguay) where it was first domesticated. It is a monoecious, creeping, vine-like annual that features running stems to 12' long. Some bush cultivars are also now available. Rounded leaves are usually unlobed with toothed margins. Flowers are pale to deep yellow. Soft or hard-shelled fruits come in a variety of shapes from rounded to cylindrical. Fruits are usually left on the plant to mature for fall harvest as winter squashes. This species includes a variety of pumpkins (some to 100+ pounds), and a large and diverse collection of other winter squashes, in colors ranging from blue to gray to pale green to orange to multi-colored, and in a variety of different shapes and sizes ranging from rounded to cylindrical (e.g., buttercup, hubbard, turban, banana, and Australian blue). Many of these winter squashes are noted for having excellent flavor. Plants in this species are sometimes commonly called soft-stemmed squash because the fruit stalks generally have a soft, thick, corky texture.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a gourd.Specific epithet means largest.
","
Problems
Bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, blossom end rot, downy mildew and powdery mildew may appear. Potential insect pests include aphids, cucumber beetles, squash bugs, stink bugs, cutworms, pickleworm and squash vine boreres. Watch for mites. Spray for insects at night when bees (needed for cross-pollination) are less active.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cucurbita moschata is a squash native to Central America and northern South America where it was first domesticated. It is a monoecious, creeping, vine-like annual that trails along the ground or climbs by tendrils. It produces a variety of fruits which vary considerably in size and shape due to large genetic variation within this species. Young leaves, flowers, shoot tips, fruits and seeds are edible. However, the fruits are usually not harvested when young, but are left on the plant to mature for eventual fall harvest as winter squashes. Velvety-hairy, shallowly- to deeply-lobed, broad-ovate to kidney-shaped leaves with toothed margins and cordate bases often have white spots on the veins. Single axillary flowers (male typically long-stalked with three stamens and female typically short-stalked with 3 two-lobed stigmas) are creamy white to orange-yellow and bloom in late spring. Stalks tend to thicken at the points were the fruits appear. Fruits generally have distinctive orange flesh. Developed commercial cultivars in this species generally fall into three different groups: (1) Neck Group (includes Neck or Winter Crookneck, Canada Crookneck, Ponca Butternut, Sucrine Du Berry and Golden Cushaw, (2) Cheese Pumpkin Group (Cutchogue Flat Cheese, Musquee de Provence, Shakertown Field, Virginia Mammoth and Long Island Cheese), and (3) Tropical Group (St. Petersburg, Seminole, Paw Paw, Brazil and White Rind Sugar).Genus name comes from the Latin name for a gourd.Specific epithet means musky.

Culture
This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. It is best grown in fertile, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Seeds may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have risen to at least 65 degrees F., typically about the time of last spring frost. Distance between plants varies depending on the plant variety and growing method. In general, if row planting for bush type, place 3 seeds together 2-3' apart in rows 3-6' apart. Thin later to 1 or 2 plants per hole. Vining types need to be spaced 3-4' apart in rows 8' apart. Seed can also be started indoors about 3 weeks before the last spring frost date, with young plants set out after last frost date. Seedlings are cold sensitive. Fertilize well, as plants can be heavy producers. Fruits resting on mulch, straw or boards resist rot. Plants will continue to produce until the first frost if all fruits are picked prior to maturity. Harvest summer squash when young before flesh gets woody and seeds harden. Harvest winter squash when mature but prior to first fall frost.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Squashes can be divided into two general categories: summer squash (eaten as immature fruits before seeds harden) and winter squash (eaten only after fruit has grown to maturity). Curcubia pepo is a large and diverse species that was probably first domesticated in Mexico. It primarily consists of summer squash including crookneck (var. torticollia), straightneck (var. recticollis), scallop (var. clypeata), vegetable marrow (var. fastigata), cocozzelle (var. inoga) and zucchini (var. cylindrica), but also contains several notable winter squashes including pumpkin (var. pepo) and acorn (var. turbinata). Summer squashes mature rapidly and can be harvested in as little as 50 days, while winter squashes can take over 120 to fully ripen. These squashes primarily come in vine or bush form, are usually prickly, and usually have conspicuously-lobed leaves. All varieties need ample room.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a gourd.
","
Problems
Cucumber beetles carrying bacterial wilt, squash vine borers and squash bugs are the most common insect pests. Squash borers (caterpillars) tunnel into stems, causing that portion of the vine to wilt. Look for entry holes with droppings outside, make a vertical slit in the problem stem, and remove the caterpillar. Squash bugs can be removed by hand or by placing boards near the plants at night (bugs hide under the boards and can be destroyed the next morning). Additional potential insect pests include aphids, cutworms, pickleworm, leaf miners, white flies, squash bugs, and stink bugs. Watch for mites. Potential disease problems include bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, blossom end rot, downy mildew and powdery mildew. Watermelon and cucumber mosaic virus may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Summer squashes can be eaten raw in salads or stir-fried, batter fried, steamed, or cooked in a variety of additional ways including such things as zucchini breads. Summer squash blossoms are excellent in soups and stews, sauteed, stuffed, or dipped in batter and fried.

Culture
Best grown in moist, acidic, well-drained soils in part shade. Tolerates full sun, but soils should not be allowed to dry out. The species is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area where it should perhaps not be attempted, but if attempted, should be sited in a southern exposure protected from winter winds. Branches killed by winter should be promptly pruned out. Cunninghamia lanceolata ‘Glauca’, an attractive blue form, reportedly has better winter hardiness (to –10 F.) than the species and is a better choice for St. Louis.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cunninghamia lanceolata, commonly called China fir, is an evergreen conifer that is native to forested areas of China and Taiwan where it may reach 150’ in height. In cultivation, it more typically grows to 35-70’ tall with a pyramidal form and tiered, spreading, horizontal branching that is slightly pendulous at the tips. It tends to sucker and often grows in a multi-trunked form. Sharply-pointed, finely-toothed, green to blue-green needles (to 2.75” long) are spirally arranged but twisted at the base to give the appearance of being two-ranked. Foliage may bronze in cold winters. Oval to globose fruiting cones (1.5” diameter) appear in small groups (1-3) at the shoot ends. Brown bark of mature trees exfoliates in strips to reveal reddish-brown inner bark. This is a prized timber tree in China.Genus name honors James Cunninghame (d. c. 1709), East India Company surgeon at Amoy, China.Specific epithet means spear-shaped.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Winter hardiness is a problem in the St. Louis area, with problems ranging from tip die-back to loss of tree.
","
Garden Uses
In warm winter climates, China fir can develop into a very interesting and handsome specimen.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cuphea hyssopifolia, commonly called Mexican heather, is native from Mexico to Guatemala. It is a rounded, densely branched 1-2’ tall tropical sub-shrub. It produces quaint, small, trumpet-shaped flowers with six spreading lavender petals and green calyx tubes. Flowers appear singly in the leaf axils along stems crowded with lance-shaped glossy green leaves (to 3/4” long). Blooms profusely summer to frost. Although heather-like in appearance, this plant is not a member of the heather family, hence the sometimes used common name of false heather. Some white- and pink-flowered cultivars are available. Flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek word kyphos meaning curved or humped in probable reference to the shape of its seed capsules.Specific epithet means leaves like hyssop.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cuphea viscosissima, commonly known as blue waxweed, clammy cuphea or tarweed, is a viscid-pubescent, somewhat weedy, herbaceous annual of the loosestrife family that produces attractive, narrow-tubular, purple to purplish-red flowers from July to October from the upper leaf axils on 10-20” tall purple-tinged stems clad with broad lanceolate leaves.  Stems, leaves and flowers are covered with sticky hairs giving rise to the common name of clammy cuphea.  This plant is native to open woods, glades, prairies, fields, rocky barrens, roadsides and waste places from New Hampshire to Nebraska south to Florida and Louisiana.  In Missouri, it is commonly found throughout the central and southern parts of the State except for the southeastern bootheel area.  

Flowers bloom singly (sometimes in pairs) from the leaf axils.  Each flower (to 1 1/2” long) consists of a narrow tubular purple calyx with 6 tiny purple petals of unequal size (2 long and 4 short) and 12 stamens.  Flower width from petal tip to petal tip is only 1/2”.  Flowers give way to seed capsules which split open when ripe.  

Flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies.  

Cuphea petiolata is a synonym and former name for this plant.Genus name comes from the Greek word kyphos meaning curved or humped in probable reference to the shape of its seed capsules.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word viscidus meaning viscid or sticky in reference to the sticky hairs found on the plant.The genus Cuphea contains about 250 species primarily native to tropical and subtropical areas.  The within species is the only one that is native to central and northern parts of the U.S.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cupressus cashmeriana, commonly known as Kashmir cypress or Bhutan weeping cypress, is an evergreen conifer that is native to Bhutan.  In its native habitat, it will grow to as much as 100-150' tall, but typically grows to 40-60' tall with a spread to 15-20' in cultivation.  It is a graceful weeping narrow pyramidal form featuring upright-ascending main branches from which droop long pendulous sprays of aromatic blue-green branchlets.  Foliage of this cypress is somewhere between the needle-like juvenile leaves and scale-like adult leaves typical of trees in this genus.  Leaves do not exceed 1/16"" in length, but are not scale-like.  Small 10-scaled cones (1/2"" diameter) ripen to copper brown.  This species is the national tree of Bhutan.  

Synonymous with and formerly described as Cupressus torulosa var. cashmeriana.Genus name is the Latin name for Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens.)Specific epithet means of Kashmir, western Himalaya.
","
Problems

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10. Best in well-drained sandy loams in full sun with medium to moderate moisture. Tolerates some drought once established. May not be grown in the St. Louis area, but does very well in dry mediterranean-type climates such as exist in many parts of California.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cupressus sempervirens, commonly called Italian cypress, is an evergreen conifer that is native to southern Europe and western Asia. In its native habitat, it typically grows in a spreading, open-horizontal form (sometimes referred to as var. horizontalis) that is rarely if ever sold in commerce. Trees commonly sold in commerce as Italian cypress are of the familiar narrow-columnar or fastigiate form that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. This columnar/fastigiate form (sometime referred to as C. s. var. sempervirens, C. s. ‘Stricta’ or Stricta Group), is unknown to the wild, but was the tree originally described by Linneaus as Cupressus sempervirens and is the cypress of classical literature that has been commonly planted in Italian classic gardens since Renaissance times. This columnar/fastigiate form features scale-like dark gray-green leaves on upright branches. Foliage is aromatic when crushed. Rounded fruiting cones (to 1.5” diameter).Genus name is the Latin name for Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens.)Specific epithet means ever green.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spider mites attack foliage in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Narrow columnar form is sometimes difficult to fit into residential landscapes. Good specimen around tall buildings.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-11 where it is easily grown in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best with morning sun and some afternoon shade.   Plants like hot summers and high humidity.  In early spring, plant rhizomes to 4” deep.  

Growing options in areas where plants are not winter hardy include (a) grow plants as annuals, (b) dig rhizomes in fall, remove top growth, and store indoors  in a cool, dry location in sawdust, peat or vermiculite that is kept very slightly moist throughout winter, or (c) grow in containers that are overwintered indoors in a cool dry location.  Plants grown in large containers may require frequent repotting because the thick rhizomes quickly grow large enough to split open a pot.  Potted specimens require lots of water during the growing season.  

Rhizomes are typically harvested in fall when the foliage begins to dry off.  Some of the harvested rhizomes can be set aside for propagation.

Turmeric is native to tropical southwestern India where temperatures typically range from 65 to 85 degrees F. in moist humid conditions.  Turmeric typically begins growth at the beginning of the monsoon season and thrives in monsoon conditions, but becomes dormant when the monsoon ends and drier soils prevail.  A large percentage of the world’s commercial crop is produced in India.  There is no monsoon in the U.S., but plants grown in Zones 8-11 require a moist summer growing season followed by a dormant winter season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, is a tropical rhizomatous herbaceous perennial in the ginger family.  It typically grows to 3-4’ tall in a foliage clump of ornamentally-attractive, canna-like, pleated, elliptic to lanceolate green leaves (each to 3 1/2’ long).  Short dense spikes of pale yellow flowers are produced in summer.  This plant is most noted for its thick, branched rhizomes which are the source (after unearthing, boiling, drying and grinding) of the bright yellow-orange powdery spice known round the world as turmeric.  It has a pungent somewhat bitter flavor.  Turmeric has a number of well-known uses including culinary (ingredient in curry powder which contributes taste and distinctive yellow-orange color), medicinal (purportedly helps relieve pain, clean wounds, lower blood pressure, treat liver ailments and contain Alzheimer’s disease) and dark yellow dye (food coloring and cosmetic dye which is sometimes considered to be a less expensive saffron-substitute).  In addition, plant leaves are sometimes used for wrapping and cooking food.  Plant flowers may be eaten as a vegetable.Genus name is the Latinized version of the Arabic name.Specific epithet from Latin means long.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Spider mites may appear if soils become overly dry.   Slugs and snails may attack young leaves.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10 (possibly including protected areas in Zone 8) where it is easily grown  outdoors in sandy, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to shade.  Perhaps best in part shade.  Appreciates a good mulch.  Superior soil drainage is needed.  Established plants tolerate some drought.  Plants also tolerate temperatures that briefly dip into the high teens but some frost damage to the foliage will occur.  Plants may not survive temperatures below 15 degrees F.  Plants sucker at the base.  Propagation is by suckers/offsets or seed.   Very slow growth, but plants live a long time.  Indoors plants should be planted in containers with a soil-based potting mix amended with sand and peat.   Site plants in filtered sun for 4-6 hours per day (as through a window curtain on an east, west or southern window).  Needs regular and consistent moisture with soil surface nearly drying  between water applications.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Notwithstanding the common name of sago palm or King Sago palm, this cycad is botanically closer to conifers than to palms.  This species in native to Kyushu (third largest Japanese island), the Ryukyu Islands and southern China.  It is a very slow-growing, symmetrical plant that produces a crown of shiny, arching, palm-like, evergreen palmate leaves atop a shaggy upright trunk.  Trunks take a long time to form (1"" diameter trunks may take years to eventually reach 12"" diameter).  Young plants typically grow to 2-3' tall over several years, but may take 50 or more years to eventually reach 10' tall.   Arching pinnate leaves (to 3-7' long depending on age) form a loose, feather-like rosette with leaflets to 7"" long.  Each leaf has a large mid-rib with very narrow, rigid, spiny-tipped, deep green leaflets.  Leaflets have revolute edges (margins rolled downward), hence the specific epithet.   Young sago palm plants produce leaves intermittently in several different growth spurts per year, however mature plants only produce leaves once per year.  Plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants).  Female plants will not produce seed without a nearby male, however these plants rarely flower when grown indoors in containers.  Males produce upright yellowish ellipsoid pollen cones (to 12-18"" tall).  Orbicular female cones produce vermilion seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a kind of palm.Specific epithet means means rolled back.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils with protection from hot afternoon sun. Plant corms just below the surface in spring. Plants are dormant in summer (see Problems section below). Mulch corms in winter. May self-seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyclamen hederifolium is a hardy cyclamen that typically grows 4-6"" tall and features pink or white tinged with pink flowers (2"" long) with a darker eye and with reflexed petals. Blooms somewhat profusely in late summer into fall, one flower per stem. Extremely attractive, ivy-shaped, mottled leaves are variably colored, but usually gray-green with silver and white marbling. The flower stalks typically rise up late summer to early fall and are followed by the foliage which persists through winter and goes dormant in late spring. Sometimes sold as C. neapolitanum.Genus name comes from the Greek word presumably from kylos meaning circle and referring to the rounded tubers.Specific epithet means with leaves like ivy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Mice and squirrels may pursue the corms. Corms are subject to rot if they receive too much water (particularly in summer dormant period) or are located in poorly drained soils.
","
Garden Uses
A small, fall bloomer which fits well in a partially shaded area of the rock garden. Also effective massed in front of shrubs or around trees or in woodland gardens. May be overplanted in summer with annuals.

Culture
Best grown in pots in light, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Plants are only winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11, and must be grown in containers or pots in the St. Louis area. Blooms in winter (December to April). Best with intense indirect indoor light in cool (65 degrees) locations. Plants go dormant in summer (lose most if not all leaves) and should be infrequently watered during this period. As cool fall temperatures arrive, plants begin to grow again and regular watering and fertilization should be resumed. May be grown from seed planted in late summer for first bloom the following winter (about 18 months later).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
C. persicum is native to the eastern Mediterranean. Species flowers are rose-pink to lavender-white or white. Florist's cyclamen are frost-tender hybrids derived from C. persicum. They feature clumps of long-stalked basal dark green leaves often variegated with silver blotching or veining. Solitary flowers with twisted and reflexed petals bloom from winter to spring atop leafless stems rising 6-9"" tall. These hybrids offer a much greater range of flower colors than the species, including violet, lavender, purple, pink, rose, red and white, often with red centers. In contrast to florist's cyclamen, the other type of cyclamen, species cyclamen, consists of a number of different species plants that typically are smaller (2-5"" tall) and usually have much better winter hardiness (USDA Zones 5 to 8). C. hederifolium, for example, may be grown in the ground year-round in St. Louis with a protected location and winter mulch.Genus name comes from the Greek word presumably from kylos meaning circle and referring to the rounded tubers.Specific epithet means Persian.

Culture
Easily grown in acidic, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best flowering occurs in full sun.  Adapts to a wide range of soil conditions, but prefers well-drained loams.  Established plants tolerate some dry soils.  Plants bloom on new growth.  Pruning is typically done in winter.  Easily propagated from hardwood or softwood cuttings.  Suckers when young and must be trained as a tree or it will spread to form a thicket.  Promptly remove root suckers to control possible spread. Best fruits are produced in areas with long hot summers.  Pick fruit before first fall frost.  Where winter temperatures dip below 5 degrees F.,  this quince may be fan-trained against a wall.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cydonia oblonga, commonly known as common quince, is a deciduous, multi-stemmed small tree or large shrub that features crooked branches clad with broad-ovate to broad-elliptic pale green leaves (to 4"" long) that are gray-hairy below.  Common quince is primarily grown today for fruit production or as a dwarfing pear rootstock.  It is native to rocky slopes and woodland margins in the Trans-Caucasus region which includes Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, southwestern Russia and Turkmenistan.  Plants have escaped garden plantings in the U. S. (particularly in the northeast), but plants are generally not considered to be invasive.  Commercial production in the U. S. is very limited (mostly in California and New York).  Common quince typically grows to 10-15' (less frequently to 20') tall.  Solitary, five-petaled, pale pink to white flowers (2 1/2"" diameter) bloom from leaf axils in late spring (May) on current season's growth.  Immature fruits (round to pear shaped quinces to 3"" diameter) are green with gray-white shading but mature in fall to bright yellow.  Fruit on cultivated varieties is usually larger.  In climates with warm winters, quinces will fully ripen on the tree/shrub and can be enjoyed fresh-picked.  However, in many areas where grown in the U. S., quince fruits are still very astringent in October when they first begin to ripen, hence they are usually cooked rather than consumed fresh.  Quinces may be used in jellies, preserves and pies.  

Cultivars include 'Champion', 'Pineapple',  'Portugal' and 'Smyrna'.Genus name is derived from the town of Cydon (now Khania) in Crete.Specific epithet means oblong.
","
Problems
Fireblight. Leaf and fruit spots.  Powdery mildew and rust.
","
Garden Uses
Small quince trees or shrubs make attractive specimens in the landscape.  Shrubs may  be grown as hedges.   Fruit may be harvested.

Culture
Best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Kenilworth ivy is most comfortable in Mediterranean-type climates (cool summers and moderate winters).  Plants are generally intolerant of high heat and humidity.  Foliage is evergreen in warm winter climates, but is semi-evergreen in the St. Louis area where it will brown up and show considerable decline in harsh winters.  Foliage is intolerant of foot traffic.  Plants grow fast, but are easy to control and are not considered invasive.  Plants in 3” pots may be spaced 15” apart.  Plants may freely self-seed in optimum growing conditions.  Propagate by seed or division.  May be grown as an annual.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cymbalaria muralis, commonly called Kenilworth ivy, is an extremely low-growing ground cover which forms a dense mat of tiny, shallow-lobed, rounded to kidney-shaped, medium green leaves (to 1"" across) which typically grow 1-2” tall on trailing stems that root at the nodes.  It is native to Europe and Asia.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in many parts of North America.  Tiny, long-stalked, snapdragon-like, blue violet flowers with yellow throats bloom May to September.  Flowers are quite attractive on close inspection, but perhaps too small to be considered showy.  

Formerly known as Linaria cymbalaria.Genus name comes from the Greek word kymbalon and Latin word cymbalum meaning cymbal referring to the leaf shape of some species.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning wall in possible reference to the ability of this plant to grow in the fissures and cracks of old walls.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Winter hardiness in the St. Louis area is a concern.  Damping off can be a problem with seedlings.  Snails, slugs and mites are occasional visitors.
","
Garden Uses
Ground cover for small areas or slopes.  Fills in fissures on stone walls or will sprawl over rocks in the rock garden.  Hanging baskets.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is evergreen (roots may be hardy to Zone 8b). In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual in gardens or in containers. It is easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but prefers full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but is best in organically rich loams with good drainage. Seed is difficult to obtain. Nurseries and seed companies generally sell starts in small pots. Fresh stalks of lemongrass (leaves and roots absent) can also be purchased from grocery stores specializing in Southeast Asian cuisine for rooting in a glass of water. Plant outside in spring after last frost date. In fall just before first frost, stalks can be harvested (cut off top leaves and save 6-"" sections of the bulbous shoot bases) and frozen for culinary use during the winter. Several leaf sections with attached roots can also be divided and potted with top leaves removed for overwintering in a bright window. These saved sections can be then used as starts for the following year. Smaller container plants can be overwintered indoors in bright light locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cymbopogon citratus, commonly called lemongrass, is a frost-tender clumping perennial grass that is popularly used as a lemony flavoring in Thai, Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian cooking and is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for that purpose. It is also an outstanding ornamental grass that lends great beauty to garden areas regardless of whether its culinary uses are to be tapped. In the St. Louis area, it typically forms a dense rounded clump of foliage to 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall and as wide in one growing season. Gracefully-arching, strap-shaped linear leaves (to 3’ long and to 1” wide) are light green. Leaves emit a lemony fragrance when bruised. It rarely produces flowers. Extracted plant oils have been used for many years in herbal medicines and perfumes.Genus name comes from the Greek words kymbe meaning a boat and pogon meaning a beard.Specific epithet means resembling Citrus for the scent.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spider mites can be a serious pest on indoor plants.
","
Garden Uses
Rapid-growing ornamental grass for herb gardens, borders, along walkways or for tubs/containers. Harvest bulbous lower leaf sections for cooking. Though tough and inedible (unless finely minced or mashed in a mortar and pestle or food grinder), sections of the mature leaf blades may be used fresh or dried for flavoring teas, soups or stews.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this plant is best grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Shelter from strong winds.  Mulch in winter in areas near the northern part of the growing range.  May be propagated by seed, division, root cuttings or suckers.   Plants have a large and deep taproot.  Cardoon is a Mediterranean-type plant that grows best in temperate climates with cool summers and mild winters.  Cardoon is considered to be an invasive weed in some parts of California where it has escaped gardens (or Scolymus Group plants have escaped gardens and reverted), and it has in some cases formed large colonies in the wild.   Cardoon may be grown for harvest of its edible leaf stalks and/or for enjoyment of its ornamental foliage.  In areas where this plant is not winter hardy, it may be grown as an annual by starting seed indoors in February and setting seedlings outside near last spring frost date.  Annual plants grown from seed may not reliably produce flowers, but the foliage is quite attractive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynara cardunculus, commonly called cardoon, is a vigorous, columnar, upright, tender perennial that features prickly, razor-sharp, jagged, deeply-lobed, silver-gray leaves (white tomentose beneath) and thistle-like flowers.  Although it is an edible vegetable (celery-like stalks may be blanched, harvested, steamed or braised and eaten), it is typically not grown in the U.S. for consumption as a vegetable, but is more often grown ornamentally in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers (flowers bloom August-September in cold winter climates).  It typically grows in a clump to 3' tall from which rise flower stalks to 6' tall topped with thistle-like blue-violet flowers.  Cardoon is native to southern Europe along the Mediterranean.  The flowers are quite showy on the plant or when cut for fresh or dried arrangements.  Unopened flower heads may be harvested and eaten as artichokes (the fleshy lower area of the involucral bracts and the heart are edible), however the size and flavor is generally considered to be a poor substitute for the commercially grown globe artichoke known as Cynara cardunculus (Scolymus Group).  For harvest of the artichoke-flavored stalks, the inedible leaves are tied together and the stalks are blanched (wrap burlap, corrugated cardboard or paper around them) when the plants reach 3' tall.  Blanching helps to tenderize and improve stalk flavor.  Stalks are then harvested (cut off at the ground) 4-6 weeks later.  

Cardoon first came to the U.S. in the mid 1800s (Spanish settlers brought it to California and French settlers brought it to the Louisiana Territory).  In contrast, Scolymus Group plants (once known as Cynara scolymus) are commonly called globe artichoke.  These plants are tamer than cardoons and are less apt to spread weed-like.  As a vegetable, Scolymus Group plants are primarily grown for harvest of the buds (artichokes) which are much larger and tastier than those buds found on cardoons.  If Scolymus Group is grown from divisions, it will reproduce as globe artichoke.  If Scolymus Group seed is planted,  it will typically revert to the invasive species form (cardoons) as frequently happens when Scolymus Group plants escape gardens in areas such as California.  Where winter hardy, the prime season for cardoon harvest is winter.  Where not winter hardy, the prime season is early fall.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means resembling a small thistle.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates heat, drought and a wide range of soils. When grown as a turfgrass, mow regularly to a height of 3/4"" to 1.5"" tall, fertilize during the growing season (May to August) and use soil barriers to prevent spread into adjacent areas. Sometimes overseeded with rye. Bermuda grass has winter hardiness problems in the Midwest Transition Area, however, and is not recommended as a turfgrass for St. Louis. Some winter kill is to be expected when winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F. Needs regular dethatching. It is not recommended as a turfgrass for lawns in the St. Louis area.'Sundevil' is considered even less winter hardy than the species.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynodon dactylon, commonly called Bermuda grass or wire grass, is a tough, warm season grass which spreads rapidly by both stolons and rhizomes. In optimum conditions, it will form a dense lawn which tolerates foot traffic well and excludes many common weeds. On the other hand, many homeowners consider it to be a noxious weed and expend considerable energy trying to eradicate it from their lawns and garden areas. The main disadvantages of Bermuda grass as a turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to late spring when grass goes dormant and (2) highly aggressive habit which results in spread into adjacent plantings such as flower beds, vegetable garden and borders.Genus name comes from the Greek words kyon meaning a dog and odous meaning a tooth.'Sundevil' is a coarse, seeded turfgrass variety which features light green blades.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. White grubs are the most common insect problem. Additional insects of concern include sod webworms, cutworms, armyworms, nematodes and mole crickets. Watch for mites. Brown patch and dollar spot are infrequent disease problems. Reportedly has good resistance to spring dead spot disease. Bermuda grass can spread invasively in the landscape.
","
Garden Uses
Turfgrass for southern lawns. Also used extensively in southern golf courses for fairway and tee areas.

Culture
Biennial that is typically grown as a cool weather annual. It is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants prefer some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Tolerates average to poor soils. Avoid unamended heavy clay soils. Sow seed directly in the garden just prior to last spring frost date or plant seed indoors in pots about 6-8 weeks prior to last frost date. In USDA Zones 6-9, seed can also be sown in fall for bloom the following spring. Plants will freely self seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynoglossum amabile, commonly called Chinese forget-me-not, produces abundant and showy sprays (one-sided terminal cymes) of light blue flowers (each to 1/4” diameter) over a long late spring to frost bloom period. Flowers bloom in the first year from seed and resemble those of forget-me-nots (Myosotis). Stems rise to 2’ tall on coarse, rounded plants with lanceolate, hairy, gray-green leaves (stalked basal leaves to 8” long and smaller sessile stem leaves to 3” long). In hot and humid summer climates, plants may decline significantly by late summer and not bloom into fall. Cultivars with blue and white flowers are available.Genus name comes from the Greek words kyon meaning a dog and glossa meaning a tongue for the leaves.Specific epithet means lovely.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-12 where is easily grown in wet, boggy soils in full sun to full shade.  Perhaps best in full sun to part shade.  Plants tend to be more compact in sun and more open, larger-leaved and taller in shade.  This is an amphibious sedge which grows well in shallow standing water.  Plants are tender perennials that are intolerant of frost.  Plants in Zones 8-9 will die back with frost, but may survive the winter and put out new foliage in spring if the roots remain unfrozen.   Plants may be grown in containers at the margins of water gardens, pools or ponds.

In the St. Louis area, these plants are tender perennials that must be brought indoors in fall before first frost for overwintering in a sunroom or greenhouse.  Containers can be brought indoors if not too large.  Another option is to divide plants and pot up the divisions for overwintering indoors.  When overwintering, set the container in a saucer filled with water, and place the container and saucer near a bright sunny window.  Add water to the saucer as needed.  

Rather than overwinter indoors, plants may be grown as if they were annuals by letting them die each winter and replacing them each spring.  

In warm frost-free climates, this sedge is weedy bordering on invasive.  It can spread aggressively by self-seeding and rhizomes.  Planting in containers helps prevent some unwanted spread.  Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council has designated this plant as Category II:  An invasive exotic that has not yet altered plant communities to the extent it would qualify as Category I.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyperus involucrata, commonly called umbrella plant or umbrella sedge, is a rhizomatous, evergreen, densely-clumping, tender perennial sedge that typically grows to 3-6’ tall in frost free areas, but to 2-3’ tall where not winter hardy and grown as an annual.  It is probably native to boggy areas and lake/stream margins in Madagascar (Malagasy Republic), but early on naturalized throughout eastern Africa.  It has been introduced in many tropical, sub-tropical and warm temperate areas around the globe over time including the southern U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized primarily in wet disturbed sites, water margins, ditches and swampy areas from Florida along the Gulf Coast to Texas plus Arizona, California and Hawaii.  

This sedge is ornamentally grown for its showy green bracts and not for its somewhat insignificant flowers and fruits.  Erect triangular stems rise up from a network of short woody rhizomes.  Each stem is topped by a whorl-like cluster of 10-25 thin slightly downward-arching leaf-like bracts (each to 6-15” long) which form a showy umbrella-shaped rosette.  Bracts look like leaves, but they are not.  The true leaves of this sedge are inconspicuous bladeless sheaths which wrap the stem bases.  

Dense clusters (15 to 25) of flattened flower spikelets (6-30 tiny florets per spikelet) rise above the umbrella-like bracts for bloom summer to fall.  Flower spikelets emerge green but turn reddish-brown as they mature.  Flowers are followed by small dark brown 3-angled nut-like fruits.Genus name comes from the Greek word kypeiros which was the name given to some local sedges.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word involvere meaning to wrap in reference to the involucral bracts on this sedge.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 9 where is may be grown in wet, boggy soils in full sun to part shade. Best in part shade. May be grown in containers at the margins of water gardens, pools or ponds. Grows well in both standing water and in boggy soils. In the St. Louis area, these plants are tender perennials that must be brought indoors in fall before first frost for overwintering in a sunroom or greenhouse. When overwintering, set the container in a saucer filled with water, and place the container and saucer near a bright sunny window in a preferably cool (60-65 degree F.) area. Plants may be grown as annuals.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyperus papyrus, commonly called papyrus, is native to Africa. It is a tall, clump-forming, tender perennial sedge that, in frost-free areas, will grow up to 15’ tall. In St. Louis gardens, stems will grow shorter (to 5-8’ tall). It features a grass-like clump of triangular green stems that rise up from thick, woody rhizomes. Each stem is topped by an umbellate inflorescence of 100+ narrow arching thread-like rays (4-12” long). Greenish-brown flower clusters appear at the ends of the rays. Flowers give way to brown, nut-like fruits. In ancient Egypt, the stems of this plant (considered by some authorities to be the bulrush of the Bible) were used to make a paper-like writing material also called papyrus.Genus name comes from the Greek word kypeiros which was the name given to some local sedges.Specific epithet is the Greek name used for paper made into rolls from this plant in Ancient Egypt.A dwarf version of this plant, designated as C. p. ‘Nanus’ or C. profiler, typically grows to only 2-3’ tall.

Culture
Winter hardy to UDSA Zones 10-11 where this plant is best grown in organically rich, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Taller growth occurs in full sun.  Performs well in soils with a coarse texture.   Best grown in climates where temperatures do not dip below 45 degrees F.  Plants are commercially grown only in frost-free climates.  For home landscapes, some light frost is usually considered acceptable (leaves drop and small branches will be killed, but new growth appears in spring).  Frost will kill seedlings in the first year.  Avoid overly moist soils.  Plants do not require staking, but are shallow-rooted and need protection from strong winds.  Best performance in humid climates.  Easy to grow from seed.  Plants go semi-dormant in winter.  Locate plants under eaves on the south side of the house near the northern edge of its growing range.  Plants are typically short-lived (4-6 years).

Cyphomandra betacea, commonly known as tamarillo or tree tomato, is a semi-woody, shallow-rooted, sub-tropical evergreen shrub with a treelike form that typically grows rapidly to 10-15’ tall (rarely in an ideal climate to 25’ tall) and features large edible tomato-like fruit on plants clothed with large ovate green leaves.  It is native to South America (probably between 5,000-10,000’ in the Andes Mountains of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile) with cultivation and naturalization occurring in Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Venezuela, Central American and some Caribbean islands.  This plant is widely grown now in New Zealand as a commercial crop.  It is a member of the nightshade family (same family as tomato and eggplant).  

Large, heart-shaped, softly hairy, pinnately-veined, oval leaves (to 4-10” long and 4-6” wide) are pointed at the apex.  Fragrant, pinkish-white flowers (to 3/4” long) are borne in loose clusters in spring.  Each flower has 5 lobes, 5 yellow stamens and a greenish-purple calyx.  Flowers are self-pollinating.  Flowers are followed by edible, egg-shaped fruits (to 2-4” long and 2” wide) which mature from gray-green to yellow and finally dull red, sometimes with faint dark longitudinal stripes.  Fruits are borne singly or in clusters of 3-12.  Fruits resemble tomatoes when cut open, but have much thicker skins than those of tomatoes.  Bruised plant foliage will emit a distinct odor similar to the odors produced by other nightshade family members.  Plants are typically short lived (4-6 years).  

Houseplants, no matter how healthy, will not fruit indoors.Genus name comes from the Greek words kypnos meaning a tumour and andros meaning male in reference to a thickening on the connective tissue of the anther.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word betaceus meaning resembling beets.This plant was originally given the common name of tree tomato because of the resemblance of its ripe fruit to the fruit of some garden tomatoes (Lycopersicon).  In the 1960s, growers in New Zealand (a major commercial exporter of tree tomato fruit) reached agreement to give all future tree tomatoes commercially grown in New Zealand the new common name of tamarillo in order to distinguish this fruit as being exotic and unique plus to clearly differentiate it from the more common tomatoes grown world-wide in home gardens.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs, snails and whitefly.  Aphids may appear.  Fruit flies may attack the fruit in some areas.  Nematodes.  Powdery mildew can be a significant disease problem.  Susceptible to cucumber mosaic virus and potato virus. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Cultivated for fruits in some tropical to subtropical areas.  Fruits can be added raw to salads. Use in sauces, jams, compotes or chutneys.  Bold foliage plant.  Ornamental curiosity.  Remove the bitter skin by scooping out the fruit or blanching the fruit in boiling water and then slipping off the skin.  May be grown from seed as an ornamental annual.

Culture
Best grown in rich, well-drained soils in part shade.   Likes moist boggy areas.  Prefers part shade with 1-2 hours of morning or evening sun in cool summer climates with moderately cold winters.  Best performance occurs in USDA Zones 3-7 (Zone 8 if plants are given additional shade).  Spreads by creeping rhizomes.  May be propagated by seed or division.  Never dig plants in the wild, not only because of their rarity but also because they transplant very poorly.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cypripedium kentuckiense, commonly called southern lady's slipper or Kentucky lady's slipper, is a clump-forming terrestrial orchid with a thick creeping rhizome and hairy stem.  It typically grows to 18-30” tall and produces the largest flowers of any known lady’s slipper.  It is rarely found in the wild, and currently carries the Center for Plant Conservation Global Rank of “G3 Vulnerable” meaning that it is at moderate risk of extinction due to restricted range, few remaining populations (often 80 or fewer), and recent widespread population declines.  Fewer than 3,000 plants may still exist in the wild.  It is native to damp low woodlands, rich alluvial floodplains, moist woodland slopes, and along streams in widely-scattered areas from Virginia to Kentucky to Alabama and further west to eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas.  Notwithstanding the geography of its native range, this orchid can be successfully grown as far north as Vermont and central Minnesota with the protection of a quality winter mulch.  

Each plant typically grows to 18-30"" tall on a single pubescent stem clad with 2-9 (on average 5) pleated, parallel-veined, broad-ovate to ovate-lanceolate, leaves (each to 7"" long) which are evenly arranged along the stem.  Each leaf is sheathed to the stem at the leaf base.  The stem is topped by a single flower which blooms in spring (late April-June).  Each flower (to 5” across) features a large, showy, cream to pale yellow pouch (inflated lower petal known as the lip) which is the size of a chicken egg, with two downward twisting, lateral, mottled greenish-purple petals (to 4"" long and 1/4"" wide) and three wavy-edged sepals which are a contrasting and showy purplish-brown.   Fruit is an ellipsoid capsule (to 2"" long) with minute but abundant seeds which matures in fall.  

Rarely found in the wild.  Plants transplant poorly and should never be dug.  Very few orchids survive transplanting from the wild to a home landscape.Genus name comes from the Greek words kupris meaning Aphrodite or from kupros meaning Cypress where Aphrodite was born and pedilon meaning shoe in reference to the purported resemblance of the flower to Aphrodite's slipper.Specific epithet is in reference to the State of Kentucky where this orchid grows.The flower purportedly resembles a pale yellow lady’s slipper hence the common name.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 6-10. Grow in moist, humusy, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Good soil drainage is essential to protect roots from rotting in winter. Crowns may be mulched with straw in winter. Site in a sheltered location in the St. Louis area where plants are not reliably winter hardy. Tolerance for dry air qualifies this plant for use as a houseplant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyrtomium falcatum, commonly called Japanese holly fern, is native to eastern Asia, India, southern Africa and Hawaii. The fronds of this fern resemble holly branches. This is an evergreen fern (deciduous in St. Louis) that typically grows in a dense, vase-shaped clump to 2’ tall. Arching, glossy, dark green fronds (1-2.5’ long) are noted for their thick, leathery pinnae, which are falcate (sickle-shaped) as the species name suggests. Spores are easily carried by wind, and species plants have escaped gardens and naturalized in certain areas of the southeastern U.S.Genus name comes from the Greek kyrtos meaning arched in reference to the fern habit.Specific epithet means sickle-shaped.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to root rot, fungal spots and scale. Winter hardiness in the St. Louis area is a concern.
","
Garden Uses
Woodland areas and shaded areas of borders or rock gardens. Border for tree or shrub areas. May be grown as a houseplant.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyrtomium fortunei, commonly called holly fern, has fronds that resemble holly branches.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  It is an evergreen fern that typically grows 12-24” tall and features stiff, upright, dull green fronds (to 2 1/2' long), each with 12-26 pairs of stiff, leathery pinnae.  Plants have escaped gardens and naturalized in certain areas of the deep South and Oregon.Genus name comes from the Greek kyrtos meaning arched in reference to the fern habit.Specific epithet honors Robert Fortune (1812-1880) Scottish horticulturist and collector in China.

Grow in moderately fertile, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Good drought tolerance. Grows best in full sun. Tolerates poor rocky soils (good bank cover). Avoid wet soils. Plants will spread invasively to form large stands. Invasiveness is primarily due to self-seeding. This species is marginally winter hardy to the St. Louis area.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cytisus scoparius, commonly called common broom or Scotch broom, is a multi-stemmed, deciduous/evergreen shrub that grows 4-8' tall and features generally upright, broom-like, slender green branching and bright yellow flowers. Green-ribbed branches are sparsely clad (but are often leafless), with small, alfalfa-like, trifoliate leaves (with 1/2"" long leaflets). Fragrant, sweet pea-shaped, bright yellow flowers (to 1"" long) appear in late spring in an often showy bloom. Flowers are mostly solitary or in pairs. Fruit is a flattened, pea-like, green seed pod (to 2"" long) with hairy margins. Pods mature to brown/black in fall and will snap open when ripe, explosively ejecting seeds several yards away. This shrub fixes nitrogen on root nodules. Common broom is native to central and southern Europe. It was introduced into the U.S. in the early 1800s as an ornamental shrub and for erosion control use. Over time, it has escaped gardens and naturalized in the East, far West and Hawaii. Plants have generally proved to be less aggressive in the East than in the West where they are listed in several states as invasive weeds.Genus name comes from the Greek word kytisos used by the Greeks for several kinds of woody legumes.Specific epithet means broom-like.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In some environments, common broom can spread invasively to form dense stands that crowd out native plants. It is considered to be an invasive species in California and the Pacific Northwest (Class B noxious weed in Washington and Oregon). A mature broom shrub can produce up to 12,000 seeds per year which can remain viable in the soil for up to 20 years.
","
Garden Uses
Cultivars of this plant are much less aggressive (some do not produce seed). Where winter hardy, common broom makes an interesting addition to landscapes and garden areas. It can also provide good erosion control on slopes or hilly areas.

Easily grown in moist, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in part shade in hot and humid summer conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dactylorhiza majalis, commonly known as broad-leaved marsh orchid or western marsh orchid or fan orchid, is a tuberous-rooted terrestrial orchid that typically grows to 6-16” (occasionally to 24”) tall.  It is native to damp or wet conditions in meadows, heaths, marshes and along streambanks in both lowland and alpine sites to 6500’ in elevation from Ireland to northern Spain east through southern Sweden, the Dolomites in Italy and the mountains of central and eastern Europe into Russia.  

Each plant typically has 4-10 slim, fleshy, ovate to lanceolate, medium green leaves whose upper surfaces are almost always mottled with purple-brown blotches.  Lower leaves grow to 7” long with the upper leaves being narrower and progressively shorter up the stem.  Flowers bloom from June into July in conical to cylindrical upright terminal racemes (2-6” long), each of which carries up to 50 flowers.  Flowers are most often purple but occasionally pink or almost white.Genus name comes from the Greek words daktylos meaning finger and rhiza meaning root for the finger-like tubers.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word maius meaning month of May in reference to the flowers of this plant blooming in May which in reality is at the very beginning of the bloom period which in most locations is centered in June.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Thick and deep taproot enables this plant to tolerate drought well. May be easily grown from seed and will self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dalea candida, commonly called white prairie clover, is a Missouri native perennial that typically occurs in glades, rocky open woods and prairies throughout the state except for the far southeastern counties (Steyermark). Tiny white flowers in dense, cylindrical, elongated, cone-like heads (to 3” long) bloom in summer atop erect, slender stems rising 1-2’ tall. Flowers bloom bottom to top, forming a dense ruff that slowly moves up the flower head. Compound, odd-pinnate, dull green leaves with 5-7 narrow linear leaflets. This is a nitrogen-fixing plant that is an important component of midwestern prairie restorations. Formerly known as Petalostemon candidum. Native Americans used the roots for food and the leaves for teas.Genus name honors 17-18th century English botanist, Samuel Dale.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word candidus, meaning white, in reference to the flower color.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dalea gattingeri, commonly known as Gattinger prairie clover or purpletassels, is an aromatic herbaceous perennial that typically grows as a decumbent plant with sprawling branches spreading to 12-20” wide.  It is native to dry, calcareous, rocky limestone glades in parts of the southeastern U.S., primarily in the Cedar Glades area of the Central Basin of Middle Tennessee, with very minor populations located in several counties in northeast Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas and Missouri.   

Stems are clad with alternate, pinnate compound leaves (to 3” long), each with 5-7 (infrequently 9) narrow, rolled, 3/4-inch long leaflets.  Tiny deep purple flowers (each to 1/2” across) are borne in cylindrical bottlebrush-like flower spikes (to 1-3” long).  Flowering progresses bottom to top, primarily from late June to September.  Flowers are followed by indehiscent legumes which are often enclosed within the calyx.Genus name honors 17-18th century English botanist, Samuel Dale.Specific epithet honors Augustin Gattinger (1825 -1903), Tennessee botanist.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 4-7.  This is a cool weather, shade-loving, woodland shrub than dislikes the hot and humid summers of the deep South.  It is best grown in moist, rich, sandy-humusy, moderately alkaline, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Application of mulch will help keep roots cool.  Although it prefers part shade locations, it will grow in full sun as long as the soils are kept uniformly moist.   Avoid full sun (leaves will scorch) in hot summer climates however.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Daphne mezereum, commonly called February daphne because of its late winter flowers, is a small deciduous shrub with an erect and bushy habit that typically grows to 3-5' tall and as wide.  It is native to forests, forest margins and shrubby areas in Europe and Western Asia.  It was introduced into North America in colonial times resulting in naturalization in parts of Canada (Quebec and Ontario) and the U. S. (New England to New York and later to Ohio, Montana and Alaska).  Oblanceolate, dark green leaves to 3.5” long are arranged spirally along the stems.  Fragrant reddish-purple to pink flowers (each to 1/2” across) bloom in stalkless clusters (2-4 flowers per cluster) in late March to early April prior to the emergence of the leaves.  Flowers are followed by small fruits (drupes to 3/8” long) which mature in June.  

All parts of this plant are poisonous to humans if ingested, especially the fruits, sap and bark.  Plant saps also typically cause skin irritations.  Plant saps were once used in a rouge-like cosmetic until it was discovered that rosy cheeks resulting from application of sap to skin were indicators of blood vessel damage rather than the blush of good health.  Fruits are attractive to birds with no resulting ill effects.Genus name originally used for laurel (Laurus nobilis) but later transferred to this genus. Originally, from  the nymph of the same name from Greek mythology, but could come from an Indo-European word meaning odor.Specific epithet comes from the Persian word mazariyun (name given to a species of Daphne).
","
Problems
Susceptible to infection from several different viruses.  Plants can be temperamental and unpredictable.  Michael Dirr reports that daphnes sometimes die very quickly for “no explicable reason.”  Watch for botrytis.
","
Garden Uses
May be difficult to find in commerce.  Rounded deciduous shrub for borders and foundations.  Specimen or small groups.  May be used as an informal hedge.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade. Can be grown in full sun as long as soils are kept consistently moist to wet. Leaf scorch will occur if soils are allowed to dry out. Prefers cool summer climates, and does not perform well in the hot and humid summers of the deep South.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Darmera peltata, commonly called umbrella plant, is thick-rhizomed perennial which typically grows 3-5' tall and is native to mountain stream banks and woodlands from southwestern Oregon to northern California. Features small pink to white flowers (to 1/2"") in terminal, rounded clusters (corymbs) which appear atop thick hairy stems in early spring before the foliage. Large, rounded, medium green, toothed and lobed leaves (to 18"" across) emerge after bloom to form a foliage mound which remains attractive throughout the growing season as long as consistent moisture is supplied. Leaves are peltate (as the species name suggests)... meaning that each leaf arises from the rhizome on a long petiole which attaches to the center of the leaf, thus creating a large leaf cup. Upward facing leaves typically collect and hold small pools of rain water. Formerly known as and sometimes still sold as Peltiphyllum peltatum.Genus name honors Karl Darmer, 19th-century Berlin horticulturist.Specific epithet refers to the peltate leaves.The common name is in reference to either the umbrella-like flower clusters or the inside-out-umbrella-like appearance of the leaves or both.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf scorch may occur if soil moisture levels are not maintained.
","
Garden Uses
This is a substantial plant that needs a large space. Grows well in average garden soil in shaded areas as long as moisture requirements can be met. Also effective in moist woodland areas, native plant gardens, boggy areas or along streams and ponds margins where rhizomes help stabilize the banks.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 9-10. In St. Louis it is grown as an annual. In the ground, plants do best in rich, humusy, well-drained loams in full sun with regular moisture. Purchase plants from nurseries in spring or start seeds indoors about 6-8 weeks before last spring frost. Set plants out after last frost date. Plants tend to sprawl, and are best spaced about 3’ apart unless staking or other support will be used. Deadheading flowers is not necessary. Harvest ripe seed for planting in the following spring. Self-seeding may occur in the St. Louis area even though plants are not winter hardy. Container plants may be cut back and overwintered indoors in a sunny window.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Datura inoxia commonly called angel’s trumpet, is native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrubby, sprawling, short-lived, tender perennial that is grown in St. Louis as an annual. It grows 2-3’ tall and sprawls to as much as 3-6’ wide. Ovate, wavy-margined, dark green leaves (to 8” long) have a downy texture. Single or double, upward-facing trumpets (to 7” long and 4” wide at the mouth) have a sweetly overpowering fragrance. Flowers are cream to pink to lavender, and last one night. Each flower will unravel in the evening to reveal a fragrant trumpet-shaped bloom that only lasts until noon the following day. Flowers will bloom intermittently from mid-summer to frost. Flowers are followed by downy spherical fruit covered with stiff spines, hence the sometimes used common name of downy thorn apple for this plant. Plants belong to the nightshade family and all parts are extremely toxic. Datura is similar to Brugmansia, except the trumpets of the latter are larger, last for several days and droop downward. Nomenclature for plants in the genus Datura is confusing.Genus name comes from an Indian vernacular name.

Culture
Best grown in a loose, fertile, well-drained soil that is free of rocks or heavy clumps of clay that may distort root development.  Best in full sun, but tolerates some light shade.  Avoid unamended clay soils.  Raised beds may be used.  Seed may be sown about two-three weeks prior to last spring frost date.  Sow seeds with a very thin layer of  covering material (compost or peat).  Keep soils surface moist to prevent crusting.  Germination typically takes up to 14 days in 60 degree temperature soils.  Provide consistent moisture.  When seedlings rise to 1-2"" tall, thin them to 1 1/2-3"" apart.   Harvest in 2-3 months.  Leave carrots in the soil until needed (fresh pulled carrots usually have the best taste).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cultivated carrots are popular vegetables which feature edible tapered taproots that are typically orange.  Cultivated carrots were reportedly first developed in Afghanistan from wild carrot (Daucus carota var. carota) which is the weedy  Queen Anne's lace that is native to Europe and Asia but has naturalized over time in North American fields, disturbed ground and along roadsides.   Carrots  typically grow from 3"" to 36"" tall depending on variety (cultivars cover a wide range of plants ranging from baby carrots to much larger versions) with finely divided foliage.  Carrots are biennial and do not produce flowers the first year, but clusters (umbels) of tiny white flowers will appear the second year if plants have not been removed from the garden.Genus name comes from a Latin name.Specific epithet from Greek means carrot.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Carrot rust fly maggot and wireworm are potential insect problems.  Aster yellows (inner foliage yellows and stunts with stunted taproot) is a potential disease problem (spread by leafhoppers).

Culture
Easily grown in wet soils in full sun to part shade.  This plant is a native U.S. wetland plant that thrives in marshes, bogs, and the mucky banks of ponds, lakes and water bodies, including locations in shallow standing water to 24” deep in the eastern half of North America.  It often colonizes in damp ground near shorelines.  This plant can spread rapidly.  It is considered to be an emergent aquatic plant in stagnant, slow-moving water.  Plants will clonally reproduce whenever the stem tips dip to touch moist ground or water.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Decodon vertilicillatus, commonly known as swamp loosestrife or water willow, is a multi-stemmed, woody-based, sub-shrub that typically grows to 6-8’ tall in a variety of wetland areas ranging from swamps to areas where plants are partially submerged in standing water to as much as 24” deep.  It is native to marshes, water margins, peaty bogs, sloughs, swamps and shorelines along ponds, small lakes and fens, from Ontario and central Maine south to Florida and Louisiana north along the Mississippi River to the Missouri bootheel and southern Illinois.  

Slender, recurved to arching, usually unbranched, wand-like stems grow to 3-8’ long.  Stems of plants growing in water margins will typically arch over the water in an ornamentally attractive fashion.  Stems are clad with toothless, nearly stalkless, elliptic-lanceolate to lanceolate, opposite or whorled, willow-like leaves (each to 1 1/2 to 6” long and to 1” wide).  Showy, bell-shaped, five-petaled, deep pink to rose-purple flowers (1” across) bloom in dense clusters in the upper leaf axils during July-August.  Each flower has five petals, 5-7 sepals and 10 stamens.  Fruit is a rounded capsule.  Plants may form sizeable clumps at the edges of lakes and streams.  Leaves acquire often attractive shades of red, orange and yellow in fall.   Despite the willow-like leaves, this plant is not related to willows. 

D. verticillatus is the only species in this loosestrife family genus.Genus name is from Greek decas meaning odous","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Japanese beetles can be problematic in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
Moist to wet soils in sun.  Not a good plant selection for small gardens.  It is useful as a waterside plant in large landscapes.  Willow-like leaves arch gracefully over water margins.  Hedge.  Single specimen.

Culture
Winter  hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it is easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Best with consistent moisture except during the dry/dormant season when watering should be reduced.   Plants dislike temperatures that dip below 50 degrees F.  Propagate by tip cuttings or seed.   Plants grown from seed typically do not flower in the first 7-10 years.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Delonix regia, commonly called flamboyant or royal poinciana, is a tropical tree that is native to Madagascar but  has been widely planted around the world in tropical and semi-tropical areas.  It typically grows to 30-40' tall with a broad-spreading, flat-topped, umbrella-like crown.  Crowns of mature trees often spread to 60-70' wide.  This tree is noted for featuring a superb ornamental display of showy scarlet flowers and compound mimosa-like leaves.  In the U. S.,  it can be grown outdoors in the far southern areas of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California plus Hawaii. This tree is deciduous in climates that have a dry season or mildly cool winter, but otherwise is evergreen.  Lacy, feathery, mimosa-like, bipinnately compound  leaves to 8-15"" long, each having 10-20 pairs of pinnae with further division into 25-35 pairs of  smaller pinnules.  Flowers (3-4"")  are a brilliant scarlet orange.  Each flower has four spreading petals and a larger fifth petal (the banner) which has streaks of yellow and white.  In the continental U. S., flowering typically occurs from late spring into summer.  Flowers give way to flattened bean-like fruit pods (each to 24"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek words delos meaning evident or conspicuous and onux meaning a claw and referring to the long-clawed petals.Specific epithet means royal.Common name of royal poinciana honors M. de Poinci, 17th century governor of the French West Indies.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Spreading crown is too large for many lots.  Vigorous root systems can lift sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, flamboyant is an outstanding flowering tree for gardens, parks, along streets, and for large front yards.  Mature trees provide excellent shade.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Delphinium carolinianum, commonly known as wild larkspur or Carolina larkspur, is an herbaceous perennial of the buttercup family that is native from Virginia to Missouri south to Florida and Texas.  It is native to moist rich woods, thickets, ravines, hill prairies, upland sand prairies, rocky limestone glades, barren savannas, upland rocky woodlands, wooded rocky slopes, dry open woods and railroad right-of-ways.  It grows within the same geographic range as D. tricome, but is basically a taller and later blooming relative.  It is variable in terms of flower color, stem pubescence, plant vigor and leaf size.  

Each plant features a basal cluster of long-petioled, grayish-green leaves (to 4” wide), each leaf being palmately cleft into five deeply cut lobes with each lobe being further divided into 2-3 secondary lobes.  A sparsely-leaved flowering stalk clad with small alternate leaves and topped by a stately terminal spire typically containing 6-14 blue-violet spurred flowers rising from the basal leaf cluster in an April-May bloom which occurs at a time when the flower stalk has risen to about 12” tall.  Plants continue to grow upward after bloom, eventually reaching 18-24” tall.  Each flower (to 1 1/2” long) has five petal-like sepals and four petals.  Sepals are usually violet blue to purple, but sometimes variegated with white.  The upper sepal of each flower forms a long upright backward projecting spur as described by the common name of larkspur.  The four petals are very small.  Fruit is a seedpod which separates into 3 parts, with the dried ends extending upward in a manner reminiscent of horns.Genus name comes from the Greek word delphis meaning dolphin in reference to the flower bud shape of some species purportedly resembling a dolphin.Specific epithet means from Carolina in reference to habitat.
","
Problems
Delphiniums require considerable maintenance (staking, pruning, deadheading, disease control) in order to perform well in the garden.  Delphiniums are generally susceptible to powdery mildew, botrytis blight, leaf spots and crown rot.  Plants grown in full sun generally show better resistance to powdery mildew.  Water plants at the base to avoid wetting the foliage.  Crown rot will inevitably develop if plants are grown in poorly drained soils or planted too deep.  Slugs and snails can do significant damage.  Watch for aphids, leaf miners, stem borers and mites.  Taller plants may need staking, and appreciate being sited in locations protected from wind.  Plants are considered toxic to humans if ingested.
","
Garden Uses
Superb in cottage gardens.  Beds and borders.  Best in groupings or massed.  Plant against a stockade fence for protection from wind.  Excellent cut flower.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Delphinium elatum, commonly known as delphinium, is an herbaceous perennial of the buttercup family that is native to clearings, woodland margins, and river valleys from southern and central Europe to Siberia. Species plants have been cultivated since 1578.  Spicate flowering stems to 3-5’ tall are topped in late spring to early summer with erect, terminal, often spectacular, central flower spikes (racemes) which are densely packed with showy blue florets (25-100 per raceme).  Each floret (to 1” across) has 5 blunt, glabrous, petal-like, blue outer sepals (posterior one is spurred) and two pairs of smaller true petals, with the lower two petals being yellow-bearded.  The central raceme is surrounded by a number of smaller secondary flowering racemes (sidespikes) which develop from leaf joints below the primary bloom.  Palmately lobed green leaves are 5-7 parted near the base.  

Straight species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce today, however, because they have been largely replaced by a significant number of hybrid cultivars (typically designated as Delphinium x elatum or simply assigned to the Delphinium elatum group) which are generally considered to be of superior flowering quality (taller stems to 7-8’, larger and more floriferous flower spikes, and greater variety of flower colors).Genus name comes from the Greek word delphis meaning dolphin in reference to the flower bud shape of some species purportedly resembling a dolphin.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word elatus meaning tall.Common name of bee delphinium is in reference to the configuration of throat petals.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Delphinium exaltatum, commonly called tall larkspur, is native to Eastern North America from Pennsylvania and Ohio south through the Appalachians into northern Alabama, with several small, isolated populations existing in the Ozarks in far south central Missouri. The Missouri populations are known to occur on wooded limestone slopes above the Jack's Fork and Current Rivers in Shannon and Howell Counties. Tall larkspur typically grows 4-6' tall and features loose terminal racemes of gentian blue flowers which bloom in summer. Individual flowers (to 1"" long) are complex and asymmetrical and feature five sepals, one of which is spurred into a distinctive prong resulting in the common name. Palmately divided, 3-5 lobed, deep green leaves. This species is taller, blooms later and has more abundant foliage than most other native U.S. larkspurs. As is the case with many of the buttercup family members, all parts of this plant are poisonous.Genus name comes from the Greek word delphis meaning dolphin in reference to the flower bud shape of some species purportedly resembling a dolphin.Specific epithet means very tall.
","
Problems
Susceptible to powdery mildew, botrytis blight, leaf spots and crown rot. Slugs and snails are sometimes visitors. Taller plants may require support. Larkspurs generally grow best in cool summer climates.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Delphinium treleasei, commonly called Trelease's larkspur, is a rare species that is native to only six counties in the southeastern Ozark region of Missouri where it is most often found on limestone glades. It grows 2-3' (less frequently to 4') tall, and features loose terminal racemes of deep blue to bluish-purple flowers which bloom in spring. Individual flowers (to 1"" long) are complex and asymmetrical and feature five sepals, one of which is spurred into a distinctive prong resulting in the common name. Lower petals have yellow beards. Deep green leaves are narrowly and deeply divided. As is the case with many of the buttercup family members, all parts of this plant are poisonous.Genus name comes from the Greek word delphis meaning dolphin in reference to the flower bud shape of some species purportedly resembling a dolphin.Specific epithet honors William Trelease, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden from 1889 until 1912.
","
Problems
Larkspurs are generally susceptible to powdery mildew, botrytis blight, leaf spots and crown rot. Slugs and snails are sometimes visitors. Taller plants sometimes need support. Larkspurs generally grow best in cool summer climates, however this native species should do well in the St. Louis area.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Delphinium tricorne, commonly known as dwarf larkspur or spring larkspur, is an herbaceous perennial of the buttercup family that is native to moist rich woods, thickets, ravines, wooded rocky slopes, and cliffs from Pennsylvania to Minnesota south to Oklahoma and Georgia.  Each plant features a basal cluster of long petioled grayish-green leaves (to 4” wide), each leaf being palmately cleft into 5 deeply cut lobes with each lobe being further divided into 2-3 secondary lobes (or deeply palmately cut into into narrow lobes).  A sparsely-leaved flowering stalk clad with small alternate leaves and topped by a stately terminal spire typically containing 6-14 blue-violet spurred flowers rises from the basal leaf cluster in an April-May bloom which occurs at a tune when the flower stalk has risen to about 12” tall.  Plants continue to grow upward after bloom, eventually reaching 18-24” tall.  Each flower (to 1 1/2” long) has 5 petal-like sepals and 4 petals.  Sepals are usually violet blue to purple, but sometimes variegated with white.  The upper sepal of each flower forms a long upright backward projecting spur as described by the common name of larkspur.   The four petals are very small.  Fruit is a seedpod which separates into 3 parts, with the dried ends extending upward in a manner reminiscent of horns.Genus name comes from the Greek word delphis meaning dolphin in reference to the flower bud shape of some species purportedly resembling a dolphin.Specific epithet means three-horned in reference to the three-horned fruits.

Problems
Delphiniums require considerable maintenance (staking, pruning, deadheading, disease control) in order to perform well in the garden.  Delphiniums are generally susceptible to powdery mildew, botrytis blight, leaf spots and crown rot.  Plants grown in full sun generally show better resistance to powdery mildew.   Water plants at the base to avoid wetting the foliage.  Crown rot will inevitably develop if plants are grown in poorly drained soils or planted too deep.  Slugs and snails can do significant damage.  Watch for aphids, leaf miners, stem borers and mites.  Taller plants may need staking and appreciate being sited in locations protected from wind.  Plants are considered toxic to humans if ingested.
","
Garden Uses
Superb in cottage gardens.  Beds and borders.  Best in groupings or massed.  Plant against a stockade fence for protection from wind.  Excellent cut flower.

Culture
Best grown in moist, rich, humusy, acidic, medium moisture loams in part shade to full shade. With consistent moisture, it tolerates full sun. Also tolerates a wide range of soils, including poor rocky soils and, once well established, dry soils. Also tolerates full shade. Spreads aggresively by rhizomes to form colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dennstaedtia punctilobula is commonly called hay-scented fern as the fronds release a fragrance reminiscent of fresh mown hay when brushed with a hand, crushed or bruised. It is a deciduous fern that is native to open woods and wooded banks in the eastern and midwestern U.S. Although uncommon in Missouri, it is quite common, almost to the point of being considered weedy, in some parts of its range such as New England. It typically grows to 2’ tall and features lacy, narrow-triangular, erect to arching, yellowish green fronds (to 30” long). Fronds turn yellow in fall. Marginal sori are surrounded by cup-shaped indusia, hence the sometimes used common name of cup fern for plants in the genus Dennstaedtia.Genus name honors August Wilhelm Dennstedt, German botanist (1776-1826).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In hot summer climates, fronds tend to decline by late summer.
","
Garden Uses
Good fern for naturalizing in woodland areas, shade gardens, cottage gardens or wild areas.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist, rich, humusy soils. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where it should be grown in a protected location. Consider leaving dead fronds as a winter mulch.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Deparia petersenii, commonly called Japanese lady fern or black lady fern, is a deciduous fern which typically grows to 18"" tall (occasionally to 24"") and as wide. Features attractive blackish-green, upright arching, triangular fronds. Sori are arranged in a herringbone pattern on the undersides of the pinnae. Fiddleheads begin to unfurl in late spring after most other ferns are already leafed out. Spreads slowly by creeping rhizomes. Synonymous with and sometimes sold as Athyrium japonicum or Lunathyrium japonicum.Genus name comes from the Greek word depas meaning saucer in reference to the saucer-like indusium that covers the sori.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problem. Winter hardiness in the St. Louis area is a concern.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or group in woodland or shade gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in part shade. Prefers moist, organically rich soils. Cut old foliage to the ground in late winter before new shoots appear. Flowering stems may be removed in fall to tidy plants or left for winter interest. This is one of the few ornamental grasses that grows well in moderately shady locations, however it will not flower well if moved into too much shade. Semi-evergreen foliage may retain some green color in a mild St. Louis winter. May self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Deschampsia cespitosa, commonly called tufted hair grass, is a clump-forming, cool season grass which is often grown as an ornamental. It typically forms a low, dense tussock (to 16"" tall) of very thin (1/5"" wide), arching, flat to inrolled, dark green grass blades (to 2' long). Numerous flower stems rise in summer from the foliage mound to a height of 3' bearing wide, airy panicles (to 20"" long) of tiny, variably-colored flowers (tones of gold, silver, purple and green) which form a cloud over the foliage that is particularly attractive when backlit. Flower panicles turn yellowish-tan after bloom as the seed ripens and may remain attractive through much of the winter. One of the few ornamental grasses that grows well in shade.Genus name honors Louis August Deschamps (1765-1842) French surgeon and naturalist.Specific epithet means tufted.Common name is in obvious reference to the hair-like grass blades which grow in tufts.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent massed in woodland gardens or naturalized areas where the ethereal summer bloom produces a delicate cloud of subtle colors hovering above the foliage. Also effective as a specimen or in groups in shaded areas of borders, large rock gardens or moist areas along ponds or streams. Mixes well with shade loving perennials such as ferns and hostas.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium  moisture, well-drained soils in part shade.  Prefers moist, organically rich soils, but grows well in dry shade.  Cut old foliage to the ground in late winter before new shoots appear.  Flowering stems may be removed in fall to tidy plants or may be left for winter interest.  This is one of the few ornamental grasses that grows well in moderately shady locations, however it will not flower well if moved into too much shade.  Semi-evergreen foliage may retain some green color in a mild St. Louis winter.  May self-seed in optimum growing conditions.  Plants dislike high heat and humidity and often perform poorly south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Deschampsia flexuosa, commonly called wavy or crinkled hair grass, is clump-forming, cool season grass which may be grown as an ornamental.  It is native to dry open woods, slopes, fields, grasslands and  open areas in North America, Europe and Asia.  It typically forms a low, dense tussock (to 16” tall) of very thin, arching, flat to inrolled, wiry, dark green grass blades (to 2’ long).  Numerous flower stems rise in summer from the foliage mound to a height of 3’ bearing wide, airy panicles of tiny, purple to bronze flowers which form a cloud over the foliage that is  attractive when backlit.  Flower panicles turn gold after bloom as the seed ripens, and may remain attractive through much of the winter.Genus name honors Louis August Deschamps (1765-1842) French surgeon and naturalist.Specific epithet means zigzag or winding.Common name is in obvious reference to the hair-like grass blades.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent massed in woodland gardens or naturalized areas where the ethereal summer bloom produces a delicate cloud of subtle color hovering above the foliage.  Also effective as a specimen or in groups in shaded areas of borders, large rock gardens or areas along ponds or streams.  Mixes well with shade loving perennials such as ferns and hostas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Desmanthus illinoensis, commonly called prairie mimosa, Illinois mimosa or Illinois bundle flower, is a Missouri native perennial which occurs in prairies, thickets, glades, rocky slopes/open areas and along railroad tracks throughout much of the State. It is an erect, somewhat weedy plant which grows 2-3' (less frequently to 5') tall with mimosa-like, compound bipinnate foliage. Globular flower heads (1/2"" diameter) of extremely tiny, 5-petaled, white flowers (30-50 flowers per head) bloom in June-July on short axillary stalks. Projecting yellow stamens give the flower heads a spherical brush appearance. Curved, dark brown seed pods (to 1"" long) develop in clusters (or bundles) on the flower heads in late summer and persist into fall. This pea/bean family plant is noted as an important range plant due to its high protein content.Genus name comes from the Greek words desme meaning a bundle and anthos meaning a flower for the flowers appearing in bundles.Specific epithet means of Illinois.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Desmodium elegans, commonly known as elegant tick clover, is a deciduous sub-shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ tall.  It is native to forests, thickets, mountain slopes, rocky places, and ditches in the Himalayas from eastern Afghanistan to western China.   Key features include (a) ternate leaves (to 10” long), each leaf having three obovate leaflets that are dark green above and downy beneath, (b) small pink pea-like flowers that bloom late summer into fall in drooping terminal panicles to 8” long, and (c) segmented fruit pods which separate at maturity into one-seeded sections covered with hooked bristles which will cling to clothing or animal fur in a bur-like manner.  

Genus name comes from the Greek word desmos meaning a band or chain in reference to the jointed fruit pods.  

Specific epithet from Latin means elegant.Genus name comes from the Greek word desmos meaning a band or chain with reference to the jointed pods.Specific epithet from Latin means elegant.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Desmodium illinoense is commonly called tick trefoil or Illinois tick trefoil. In Missouri, it is primarily found in prairies and glades (Steyermark). This is a leguminous perennial that, although somewhat weedy, produces showy flowers. It is a spindly plant (2-3’ but less frequently to 5’ tall) that features trifoliolate leaves and loose, slender, terminal inflorescences of white pea-like flowers atop unbranched hairy stems. Flowers bloom in summer. Lower surfaces of the leaflets are distinctively net-veined and covered with hooked hairs. Leaf stalks have prominent stipules at the bases. Flowers give way to flattened, 3- to 7-segmented pods covered by minute hooked hairs. When the pods ripen, the segments separate into one-seeded sections that cling to clothing in the manner as burs. Desmodiums are also sometimes commonly called beggar’s lice or beggarsweed.Genus name comes from the Greek word desmos meaning a band or chain with reference to the jointed pods.Specific epithet means of Illinois.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-9. This is a short-lived perennial that is perhaps best grown as a biennial. However, many gardeners simply purchase cold treated plants in spring and grow them as annuals. Moreover, many of the new cultivars will bloom the first year from seed if the seed is started early enough. Sweet William is best grown in deep, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun, but generally appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. In optimum growing conditions it will reseed each year and remain in the garden for many years as if it were a long-lived perennial. Double-flowered forms will not come true from seed, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flowers (shear back large plantings) promotes perennial tendencies. Seed may be planted directly in the garden in late spring for bloom the following year. Some nurseries sell seedlings in early fall that may be planted immediately for bloom the following year. Nurseries commonly sell plants in spring for flowering the same year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus barbatus, commonly called sweet William, typically grows 12-24” tall and features small flowers held in dense, flat-topped terminal clusters (3-5” wide). Many cultivars are available in commerce, including double-flowered forms as well as some dwarf plants (4-8” tall). Flowers come in vivid shades of red, pink, white and bicolor, sometimes with a contrasting eye, and with fringed petals that are bearded on the inside. Bloom from late spring to early summer. Flowers may be fragrant, although many of the newer cultivars have no scent. Lance-shaped medium green leaves (to 4” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means bearded or with long, weak hairs.

Culture
Easily grown in average, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun.  Plants require lots of sun for good flowers, but prefer cool summer temperatures.  Plants generally perform best in organically rich, gritty loams in neutral to slightly alkaline soils.  Good drainage is essential, but incorporating leaf mold and other organic material into the soil helps retain some moisture which is often needed in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area.  Prompt removal of spent flowers may prolong bloom period, but can be quite labor intensive.  This is a perennial plant that may be grown as an annual.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus caryophyllus, commonly called carnation or clove pink, is a loosely-tufted, woody-based herbaceous perennial that features fragrant, pink, purple-pink, or white often double flowers on stiff 30-inch tall stems clad with narrow, linear, gray-green leaves.  It is native to the Mediterranean area.  Original wild carnations are rarely found in commerce today, but serve as historical ancestors to the 1000s of carnation cultivars and hybrids which have been developed over time for use in both outdoor gardens or under glass for the cut flower industry.  This species has been widely bred over time to produce a large number of varieties and cultivars ranging in size from diminutive plants to 6” tall up to long-stemmed plants rising to as much as 5’ tall.  

Large-flowered carnations today are divided for organizational purposes into two different groupings:  (1) border carnations (fragrant double flowers on stems rising to 16” tall) for use in outdoor gardens and (2) florist’s carnations (fragrant double flowers on stems rising to 3-4’ tall) primarily grown in greenhouses for supplying the florist trade.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet comes from Greek karya meaning walnut tree and phyllon meaning leaf in reference to the aromatic smell of walnut leaves which led to the use of the name for the clove which further led to the within carnation being commonly called clove pink.‘Clarion’ is a border carnation that features clear, yellow, double flowers on strong upright stems rising to 16” tall.  Linear gray to silver leaves (to 3-6” long).

Culture
China pinks are biennials or short-lived perennials that are primarily grown as annuals in the St. Louis area. They are sometime described as cool weather annuals because they thrive in cool summers, but dislike the hot and humid summers typical of the St. Louis climate. They are best grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun, but appreciate some afternoon shade in hot summer weather. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date. Set out seedlings and purchased plants 1-2 weeks before last frost date. Plantings may burn out in hot St. Louis summers or may melt out in the center when soils are not well-drained. Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom. When flowering declines, plants may be sheared to promote additional bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus chinensis, commonly called China pinks, grows to as much as 30"" tall and features pink to lilac flowers with fringed petals and a purple eye. Most cultivars available in commerce today are bushy compact plants that typically grow in mounds or clumps to 6-12"" tall and as wide and feature a longer flowering period and a much greater range of flower colors, including many different shades of white, pink and red with interesting bicolor combinations thereof. Flowers appear in 10-15 flowered clusters in summer. Narrow, lance-shaped stem leaves (to 3"" long). Hybrids of D. chinensis and D. barbatus generally provide better flowering for the St. Louis climate.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means of China.
","
Problems
Susceptible to crown rot and rust, particularly in poorly-drained soils. Watch for snails and slugs. These are high maintenance plants that need regular shearing to force additional bloom.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers fertile, alkaline, somewhat gritty loams with good drainage. Tolerates some part afternoon shade, particularly in hot summer climates. Plants tend to die out in the center if drainage is not superior. Division and/or reseeding may be necessary every 2-3 years. Prompt removal of spent flowers may prolong bloom period, but is quite labor intensive. For larger plantings, it is perhaps more practical to simply shear off spent flowers after bloom. Shearing plants after bloom but before seed sets will prevent any unwanted self-seeding, will trim the foliage and may promote a possible sparse rebloom in fall. Plants are easily grown from seed and may self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus deltoides, commonly called maiden pink, is an evergreen perennial that typically forms loose spreading mats of foliage to 4-6” tall and to 24” wide. Narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves. Heavily fringed, slightly fragrant, single flowers (to 3/4” diameter) appear on branched flowering stems (8-12” tall) in late spring, covering the foliage mound with brightly colored bloom. Species flowers are usually deep pink with a dark, pale spotted band at the base of the petals. Evergreen foliage remains attractive year-round, as long as soils are given consistent moisture during the growing season.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means triangular.“Pink” in the common name is in reference to the fringed petals that typically look as if they were cut with pinking shears.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spot can be troublesome in humid summers, particularly where plants are crowded. Crown rot may attack plants grown in moist to wet, poorly drained soils.
","
Garden Uses
Rock gardens, border fronts, edgings and containers. Evergreen foliage can serve as an attractive ground cover year-round.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-9 where it is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Prefers fertile, slightly alkaline, somewhat gritty loams.  Well-drained soils are needed to prevent possible onset of crown rot.  Plants will usually not survive in wet winter soils.  Tolerates heat, humidity and occasional episodes of drought better than most other species of dianthus (performs very well in the southeastern U.S.).  Prompt removal of spent flowers usually prolongs the bloom period, but can be quite labor intensive.  After flowering is completed, plants may be lightly sheared back to maximize the ornamental appearance of the foliage mat.  Plants may be grown from seed.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus gratianopolitanus, commonly known as cheddar pink, is a mat-forming perennial that produces numerous, fragrant, usually solitary, rose-pink flowers (each to 1” diameter) which bloom in May-June atop wiry stems rising above a tufted mound of foliage to as much as 12” tall.  Foliage may spread over time to as much as 24” wide.  Some intermittent continued bloom typically occurs throughout much of the remaining summer, particularly if flowers are promptly deadheaded before producing seed.  Each flower has an ornamentally attractive darker pink eye ring.  Glaucous, grassy, linear leaves form a dense spreading mat of blue-gray to gray-green foliage which is attractive throughout the growing season.     

This dianthus is native to the Cheddar Gorge in southwest England, hence the common name of cheddar pink, east to Poland and the Ukraine.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means of Grenoble, Dauphine, France.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Prefers organically rich, neutral to slightly alkaline, gritty loams.  Good drainage is essential, but incorporating leaf mold and other organic material into the soil helps retain some moisture in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area.  Plants do not perform well in areas of hot summer temperatures.  Prompt removal of spent flowers may prolong bloom period, but can be quite labor intensive.  For larger plantings, it is perhaps more practical to simply shear off spent flowers after bloom for appreciation of the ground cover effect of the foliage.   Division is best done in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus plumarius, commonly called cottage pink, grass pink, garden pink, Scotch pink, or pheasant’s-eye pink, is a compact, mat-forming dianthus that typically grows to 9-12” tall, spreading over time to 18-24” wide.  It is native from central Europe to Siberia.  Wild plants are ancestors of the border pinks found in gardens today.  Five-petaled flowers (to 1.5” across) ranging in color from rose to pink to rarely white, all with dark centers, are fringed and fragrant.  Flowers bloom late spring to early summer, with continued bloom occurring throughout much of summer if flowers are promptly deadheaded before producing seed.  Narrow, linear, grass-like, gray-green, evergreen leaves (to 4” long) form a spreading mat of foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means plumed or feathered.Many of the plants in the genus Dianthus are commonly called pinks in reference to their fringed flower petals that look as if they had been cut with pinking shears.‘Itsaul White’, as amusingly suggested by the cultivar name, features white flowers on stems rising to 8” tall.  Flowers are semi-double.  This is an Itsaul Plant selection introduced by Saul Nurseries of Atlanta, Georgia.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Diarrhena americana is a Missouri native perennial grass which typically grows 2-3' tall and occurs in rich, moist woods, along streams and at the base of limestone bluffs in the southern part of the State. Features erect to arching, shiny, narrow, bright green blades (1/4 to 3/4"" wide) which gradually turn golden in fall and then tan in winter. Flowers with insignificant greenish coloring (anthers are yellowish) appear in drooping, few-flowered panicles (4-12"" long) on stems rising above the foliage in summer. Flowers give way in mid to late summer to hard, brown seed heads. Each seed is tapered to a blunt beak, thus giving rise to the sometimes used common names of American beakgrain or beak grass.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice and arren meaning male  in reference to each flower having two stamens.Specific epithet means of the Americas, North or South.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Diarrhena obovata is a Missouri native woodland perennial grass which grows in a clump to 2-3’ tall and as wide, and typically occurs in scattered shady areas throughout the State primarily in mesic upland forests (ravines and valleys), along stream banks and at the bases and ledges of moist (often limestone) bluffs (Steyermark). This grass generally features erect to arching, shiny, narrow, bright green blades (1/4 to 3/4” wide) which gradually turn gold in fall and then tan in winter. Flowers with insignificant greenish coloring (anthers are yellowish) appear in drooping, few-flowered panicles (4-12” long) on stems rising above the foliage in mid-summer. Flowers give way to hard, brown seed heads. Each seed is tapered to a pointed beak, thus giving rise to the sometimes used common names of beak grass or obovate beakgrain. This grass is perhaps most distinctive in late summer/early fall when the beaked grains are present. Diarrhena obovata is synonymous with and was once designated as Diarrhena americana var. obovata (Gleason 1952). More recent testing conducted by Brandenburg and others (1991) reveals that the two plants merit separate species status. Differences are very technical. Steyermark maintains that D. obovata has (1) elliptic-obovate lemmas (5-7 mm long) that are rounded at the tip and short-awned, (2) fruits (1.8-2.5 mm wide) that are narrowed abruptly to a pointed beak, and (3) leaf sheaths that are usually glabrous, whereas D. americana has (1) ovate lemmas (7-10 mm long) that are tapered gradually to a pointed or short-awned tip, (2) fruits (1.3-1.8 mm wide) that are tapered to a blunt beak and (3) leaf sheaths that are often hairy. Although the native ranges of these grasses overlap, D. obovata is most commonly found from Ohio west to the Great Plains and D. americana is most commonly found from Ohio to the east coast and south to Tennessee. See Diarrhena americana.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice and arren meaning male  in reference to each flower having two stamens.Specific epithet is in reference to the egg-shaped grains.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Prefers rich, moist, humusy soils in part shade. Intolerant of wet soils in winter. This is a spring ephemeral which usually disappears from the garden by early summer (dry soils tend to hasten this process).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dicentra cucullaria, commonly called Dutchman's breeches, is an easily recognized, graceful, early spring, Missouri native wildflower which typically occurs on forest floors, rocky woods, slopes, ledges, valleys, ravines and along streams throughout most of the State. Features deeply-cut, fern-like, grayish-green foliage and racemes of waxy, white (infrequently tinged with pink), yellow-tipped flowers shaped like pantaloons with the ankles upward (hence the common name). Flowers are borne in a row drooping from leafless stems arching above the foliage in early spring. Plants typically grow to 12"" tall, with the flower stems and basal leaves rising directly from a scaly rootstock.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice and kentron meaning a spur for the two-spurred flowers.Specific epithet means hood-like.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to aphid infestations. Good soil drainage is essential for plant survival.
","
Garden Uses
Best naturalized in woodland, wildflower or native plant gardens. Generally considered inappropriate for borders because the plants go dormant by summer.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dicentra eximia, commonly called fringed bleeding heart, is a native wildflower of the eastern United States that typically occurs on forest floors, rocky woods and ledges in the Appalachian Mountains. Features deeply-cut, fern-like, grayish-green, foliage which persists throughout the growing season and pink to purplish red, nodding, heart-shaped flowers carried above the foliage on long, leafless, leaning stems. Protruding inner petals of the flower appear to form a drop of blood at the bottom of each heart-shaped flower (hence the common name of bleeding heart). Plant typically grows to 15"" tall, with the flower stems and basal leaves growing directly out of the scaly rootstock. Bloom begins in late spring. In cooler climates, flowering may continue throughout the summer, but in the hotter climates, the flowering will generally stop in hot weather, with a possible rebloom occurring only when the weather cools in late summer or early fall. Similar in appearance to the showy, old garden bleeding heart from Asia, D. spectabilis, except D. spectabilis is taller and wider, its flowers are larger and its foliage is less dissected and usually goes dormant by mid-summer.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice and kentron meaning a spur for the two-spurred flowers.Specific epithet means distinguished or out of the ordinary.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10. In most of the U. S. including St. Louis, it is grown as an annual. It is easily grown in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Also tolerates heat and drought. Grows well in sandy loams with good drainage. Soil drainage is particularly important if plants are grown as a ground cover. ‘Silver Falls’ may be purchased in spring from nurseries as bedding plants or may be grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dichondra argentea, commonly called silver ponysfoot or silver nickel vine, is a creeping/trailing evergreen perennial that is native to desert regions in western Texas, New Mexico, southeastern Arizona and northern Mexico.Genus name comes from the Greek words di meaning two and chondros meaning lump in reference to the fruit having two capsules.Specific epithet means silvered.‘Silver Falls’ is a cultivar that is grown in St. Louis as an ornamental annual foliage plant. It is best grown in baskets/containers or as a seasonal ground cover. From a hanging basket, it will cascade downwards to 3-6’ long in one season. As a ground cover, plants only rise to 2-4” tall, but spread rapidly by stems rooting at the nodes to 3-4’ wide in one season. Branching silver stems are clad with soft, rounded, fan-shaped, silver leaves (to 1” across). Foliage is often described as having a metallic appearance. Tiny greenish-yellow to white spring flowers are not showy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Annual accent plant for hanging baskets, window boxes or containers. Effective along rock walls where it can cascade downward. Ground cover.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10 where it is best grown in loose, organically rich, humusy, consistently moist soils in part shade to full shade. Sun-dappled part shade may be best. Site in locations protected from strong winds. Hose the trunk daily in dry hot weather. This fern is tolerant of light frost. Propagation is primarily from spores. For indoor growth, use a container filled with a potting mixture composed of bark, loam, sand and leaf mold. Provide bright but somewhat filtered sun light. Move plants outside in summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dicksonia antarctica, commonly called soft tree fern, is an evergreen terrestrial tree fern that is native to moist areas of cool mountain forests, sheltered woodland slopes, gullies and along shaded creek beds in southeastern Australia and Tasmania. In the wild, it grows to 20-30’ tall with a trunk diameter of 12-28”. In cultivation, it grows much smaller. The woody trunk is nearly black. It primarily consists of a relatively thin, erect rhizome covered with a dense mass or mantle of fibrous roots. Large, rough-textured, deeply-divided, arching, tripinnate fronds (to 10’ long) spread outward from the top of the trunk to form a canopy. A leaf cap covers the spores found on the undersides of the fronds. This plant is also commonly called Tasmanian tree fern.Genus name honors James Dickson (1738-1822), British botanist and nurseryman.Specific epithet presumably refers to the southern native range of this fern.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this tree fern is an excellent specimen for home landscapes or parks. In the St. Louis area, it may be grown in greenhouses or conservatories. Young plants may be grown in containers.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers evenly moist, fertile, humusy soils that do not become soggy. Tolerates drought only when well-established. Tolerates light shade. Does best in northern climates where the nights are cool. Can be grown from seed, but may take several years (3-4) to flower. Slow to establish, but thereafter a long-lived, low-maintenance plant. Difficult to divide and is best left undisturbed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dictamnus albus, commonly called dittany, is an upright, clump-forming, woody-based, herbaceous perennial which features rigid, vertical stems typically growing 2-4' tall. Stems are topped by terminal racemes of fragrant, 5-petaled, white or pink flowers (1"" long) in late spring to early summer. Flowers give way to star-shaped seed heads which provide some ornamental interest if left on the plant. Elegant, glossy, odd-pinnate, light green leaves are attractive throughout the growing season and emit a pleasant lemony fragrance when rubbed or crushed. Foliage also contains an oil that causes allergic reactions (skin rash) in some individuals. Another common name for this plant is gas plant. In hot weather, old flowers or seed pods emit a flammable oil which, on a windless summer evening, can be ignited with a match resulting in a brief vapor burn which is harmless to the plant, hence the common name.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a Cretan origanum, probably named after Mount Dikte.Specific epithet means white.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rigid stems usually do not need support.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen or group for borders, cottage gardens. Good with daylilies, peonies, campanulas and iris.

Culture
Dumb cane grows somewhat easily as an indoor plant in St. Louis. It prefers relatively high humidity but also tolerates some dryness. Pot may be placed on a bed of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Use a loamy, peaty, well-drained potting soil. Place in bright indirect light with protection from direct sun. Water regularly during the growing season, but reduce watering from fall to late winter. Allow soils to dry between waterings. Propagation from stem or root cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dieffenbachia seguine, commonly called dumb cane is native to Brazil. It is a popular evergreen houseplant in the St. Louis area where it is widely grown for its attractive foliage. This is a clustered perennial that features ovate-oblong to oblong pointed shiny leaves (to 12” long). Leaves are variable in color, generally being green with patches or blotches of cream/white. As lower leaves fall off, the cane-like stem becomes noticable. In its native habitat, plants will grow to 6-10’ tall, however they are generally kept much smaller when grown indoors in containers. The name dumb cane refers to the toxic qualities of this plant. Sap burns the mouth and throat causing numbness and possible paralysis of the vocal cords. Sap can also irritate human skin and eyes. Calla-type flowers followed by red berries rarely appear on indoor plants. Cultivars and hybrids of this species expand the variegated leaf colors to include additional shades of yellow and green. Plants formerly designated as D. maculata and D. picta are now generally included in the within genus.Genus name honors J.F. Dieffenbach (1790-1863) in charge of the gardens of the royal palace of Schonbrunn at Vienna around 1830.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Wear gloves when working with this plant. Sap is poisonous if ingested, and skin contact with the sap can irritate skin. Keep plants out of the range of small children. Watch for spider mites, scale, aphids and mealybugs. Fungal leaf spot, rots and blight may occur.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Diervilla lonicera, commonly known as bush honeysuckle, is a suckering, densely branched, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3' tall and to 4' wide.  It is native to dry rocky open woodland areas and thickets from Newfoundland to Saskatchewan south to North Carolina, Tennessee and Iowa.  It is noted for its small shrubby form, yellow trumpet-shaped flowers, dark green leaves and fall color.  Tube-like flowers (each to 1/2"" across), resembling the flowers of true honeysuckle (genus Lonicera), bloom in panicles (cymes) in late spring to early summer (June-July).  In order to taste the sweet nectar, the tubular flower must be suckled, hence the name honeysuckle.  Plants are self-sterile (seed set requires pollination from a nearby plant).  Flowers give rise to fruits (dry woody dehiscent capsules).  Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, pointed, opposite, glossy green leaves (to 2-5"" long) with fine marginal teeth turn interesting shades of yellow to orange sometimes changing to red in fall.Genus name honors a French surgeon named Dierville or Diereville who observed with great interest a North American native bush-honeysuckle growing in Canada during an extensive trip he took to that country in 1699-1700.  Upon his return to France, he introduced the shrub to European culture, with the bush-honeysuckle genus eventually being named in memory of him.  Linnaeus subsequently listed the observed Canadian plant as Diervilla lonicera.Specific epithet comes from the genus name for honeysuckle (Lonicera).This species should not to be confused with Lonicera japonica, which shares the common name bush honeysuckle and is an exotic invasive species to Missouri and the Midwest by the Midwest Invasive Plant Network.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Diervilla rivularis, commonly called hairy bush-honeysuckle, is a compact deciduous shrub which typically grows to 3-6’ tall. It is native to bluffs, banks, cliffs and moist rocky woods in the southern Appalachian Mountains from western North Carolina and northwestern Georgia west to eastern Tennessee and northern Alabama.  It is closely related to Diervilla sessilifolia, but is primarily distinguished by having densely hairy branchlets and leaf undersides. 

Trumpet-shaped, two-lipped, pale yellow to greenish yellow, typical honeysuckle-like flowers bloom from June to August in crowded clusters (terminal and axillary cymes).  Flowers are followed by oblong fruits (1/4” or longer).  Simple, opposite, oval to elliptic leaves (1 1/2 to 4” long), featuring rounded to cordate bases, toothed margins, hairy leaves with densely hairy undersides and pointed tips, are short-stalked below becoming nearly stalkless in the upper parts of the shrub. Good yellow-red fall color.Genus name honors a French surgeon named Dierville or Diereville who observed with great interest a North American native bush-honeysuckle growing in Canada during an extensive trip he took to that country in 1699-1700.  Upon his return to France, he introduced the shrub to European culture, with the bush-honeysuckle genus eventually being named in memory of him.  Linnaeus subsequently listed the observed Canadian plant as Diervilla lonicera.Specific epithet means loving brooks in reference to preferred moist growing habitat.The honey-like taste of the flower nectar can be enjoyed by suckling the flower, hence the common name of honeysuckle.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade. Prefers moist, organically rich, acidic soils. Soil must not be allowed to dry out. A biennial or short-lived perennial which may be grown from seed sown directly in the garden in spring after threat of frost has passed for flowering the following year. Only a basal rosette of leaves is produced in the first year from seed. This rosette overwinters as evergreen foliage, with slender flower spikes rising from the rosette in the following spring for bloom in late spring to early summer. Removal of flower spikes after bloom will encourage a secondary bloom. Cut all flowering stalks back to basal foliage before seed sets in order to encourage plants to act as perennials. If flower spikes are left in place after flowering and allowed to go to seed, plants will act more as biennials and will, in optimum growing conditions, freely self-seed. However the spent flower spikes can rapidly become quite unsightly as the seed develops and many gardeners choose to remove most spikes and leave only a few for self-seeding. As with other biennials/short-lived perennials such as hollyhocks, these plants can remain in the garden for many years through self-seeding as if they were long-lived perennials, often establishing large colonies in optimum growing conditions.

Digitalis ferruginea, commonly called rusty foxglove, is a biennial foxglove that produces only a basal rosette of medium green, oblong leaves in the first year from seed. Flowers are borne in the second year in terminal racemes (2-3' long) atop leafy, 3-5' (infrequently to 6') tall spires arising from the centers of the basal rosettes. Pendulous to horizontally-held, 0.75 to 1.5"" long, tubular, funnel-shaped, creamy yellow to pale golden brown flowers with rusty interior veining and longer than usual lower lips are closely grouped along each spike. Plant leaves are a source of the drug digitalis and are highly poisonous. A late spring to early summer bloomer. Individual flowers resemble the snipped off fingers of a glove, hence the common name of foxglove.Genus name comes from the Latin digitus meaning ""finger"" for the flower shape.Specific epithet means rusty colored.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew and leaf spot, if left untreated, can depreciate foliage considerably by mid summer. Dense crowns may rot in soggy, poorly-drained winter soils. Potential insect pests include aphids, mealy bugs, slugs and Japanese beetle.
","
Garden Uses
Tall spires provide striking color and good architectural height to the border and are particularly effective in front of dark backgrounds such as those provided by a wall or shrubs. Also effective in woodland gardens or naturalized areas.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade. Prefers organically rich soils with consistent and regular moisture. Wet soils in winter can be fatal. Removal of flower spikes after bloom will encourage a secondary bloom. If flower spikes are left in place after flowering, plants may self-seed. However the spent flower spikes can rapidly become quite unsightly as the seed develops and many gardeners choose to remove most spikes and leave only a few for self-seeding. Once flowering and seeding is completed, cut back all stems to the basal foliage. Basal foliage is basically evergreen, but damaged leaves should be removed in early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Digitalis grandiflora, commonly called yellow foxglove, is a clump-forming perennial that is native to woods and stream banks from central Europe to Turkey and Siberia. Large, tubular, funnel-shaped, pendulous, soft yellow flowers (to 2” long) with interior brown markings bloom in late spring to early summer in terminal racemes (to 12” long) atop upright leafy stems rising to 2-3’ tall. Finely-toothed, medium green, ovate-lanceolate leaves (to 10” long and 2” wide) appear in basal rosettes and alternately up the stems. Leaves in the basal rosettes are largest, becoming smaller as they rise up the stems. Individual flowers resemble the snipped-off fingers of a glove. Digitalis leaves are highly toxic to humans if ingested. Synonymous with Digitalis ambigua.Genus name comes from the Latin digitus meaning ""finger"" for the flower shape.Specific epithet is in reference to the large flowers of this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew and leaf spot, if left untreated, can depreciate foliage considerably by early to mid-summer. Dense woody crowns may rot in soggy, poorly-drained winter soils. Potential insect pests include aphids, mealy bugs, slugs and Japanese beetle. Black spot may appear. Plants in the wild are becoming increasingly uncommon due to a combination of factors including habitat destruction and unlawful collection.
","
Garden Uses
Flower spires provide architectural height to the border and cottage garden and are particularly effective in front of dark backgrounds such as provided by shrubs or buildings. Also appropriate for open woodland gardens and naturalized areas.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade. Prefers moist, organically rich, acidic soils. Soil must not be allowed to dry out. A biennial or short-lived perennial which may be grown from seed sown directly in the garden in spring after threat of frost has passed for flowering the following year. Only a basal rosette of leaves is produced in the first year from seed. This rosette overwinters as evergreen foliage, with slender flower spikes rising from the rosette in the following spring for bloom in late spring to early summer. Removal of flower spikes after bloom will encourage a secondary bloom. Cut all flowering stalks back to basal foliage before seed sets in order to encourage plants to act as perennials. If flower spikes are left in place after flowering and allowed to go to seed, plants will act more as biennials and will, in optimum growing conditions, freely self-seed. However the spent flower spikes can rapidly become quite unsightly as the seed develops and many gardeners choose to remove most spikes and leave only a few for self-seeding. As with other biennials/short-lived perennials such as hollyhocks, these plants can remain in the garden for many years through self-seeding as if they were long-lived perennials, often establishing large colonies in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Digitalis purpurea is a biennial foxglove that produces only a basal rosette of light green, oblong leaves in the first year from seed. Flowers are borne in the second year in terminal, one-sided racemes atop leafy, 2-4' tall (infrequently to 5') spires arising from the centers of the basal rosettes. Pendulous, 2-3"" long, tubular, funnel-shaped, dark rose-pink to purple (sometimes white) flowers with purple and white spots inside are closely grouped along each spike. Flowers are attractive to hummingbirds. Plant leaves are a source of the drug digitalis and are highly poisonous. A late spring bloomer that reaches its peak about the same time as roses begin to bloom. After flowering, plants can become somewhat scraggly by late summer, and, because they are biennials, consideration may be given to removing them from the garden as soon as they release their seed. Individual flowers resemble the snipped off fingers of a glove, hence the common name of foxglove.Genus name comes from the Latin digitus meaning ""finger"" for the flower shape.Specific epithet means purple.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dimocarpus longan, commonly called dragon's eye or longan, is an evergreen monoecious tree that is native to Southeast Asia.  It typically matures to 30-40' tall with spreading branches.  It is commonly grown for its edible fruit in tropical/subtropical areas around the globe, particularly in China, India , Southeast Asia and Australia.  In the U.S., it will survive winters in southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii.  Glossy, evergreen, leathery, wavy-edged, pinnate compound leaves, with each leaf having 6-10 narrow leaflets in opposite pairs.   Small male or bi-sexual pale yellow to white flowers bloom in panicles in spring.  Spherical, edible, single seeded, sweet and juicy, grape-sized fruits (3/4"" diameter) in pendant clusters ripen to yellow-brown in summer to early fall.  Each single-seeded fruit reportedly resembles the eye of a dragon, hence the common name.  Fruits may be eaten fresh, cooked, dried or canned in syrup.

Grow in sandy, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates drought and hot summers, but dislikes the high humidity of the St. Louis area. Avoid overhead watering to help prevent onset of fungal leaf diseases. Seed may be sown directly in the garden after last frost date or started indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date for earlier bloom. Also may be grown in pots/containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dimorphotheca pluvialis, commonly called rain daisy or weather prophet, is one of several different tropical composites commonly called African daisy (see also Osteospermum and Arctotis). It is a tender annual that grows 8-12” (less frequently to 16”) tall, and features daisy-like flowers with white rays (tinged purple beneath) and yellowish-brown center disks. Flowers bloom freely from summer to fall in cool summer climates, but may slow down considerably in the hot and humid St. Louis area summers. Flowers close at night and on cloudy days or before rain (hence the common names). Narrow obovate to oblanceolate, dentate green leaves (to 3.5” long). Synonymous with D. annua and sometimes included in the genus Osteospermum.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice, morphe meaning a shape and theka meaning ""fruit"" in reference to the two kinds of achenes found in the flower head.

Culture
Strict adherence to the cultural needs of this plant is essential. Venus fly trap appears to be winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10, but with adequate winter protection may also survive winters in USDA Zones 5 and 6. In residential areas where winter hardy, plants are best grown in the consistently moist soils of a bog garden. The bog garden should be prepared in advance of planting. In the St. Louis area, the bog garden should be sited in a protected location with a winter mulch in full sun to part shade. Bog gardens basically need an acidic, humusy, unfertilized, somewhat mucky soil that is constantly damp. Soils must never dry out. Plants flower in spring, produce new leaves (“traps”) in spring-summer and then mostly die back as winter approaches. Winter dormancy is usually triggered in fall when temperatures begin to fall below 50 degrees F as day lengths shorten. Soils should be mulched in winter with pine needles or leaves to protect the rhizomes from cold temperatures. If a bog garden is not available, the next best option may be to grow plants in pots/containers placed outside on a sunny deck or patio areas. Use a mixture of sand and peat moss. Containers should be placed in a tray of water that helps keep the soil constantly moist. It is best to use rain water, distilled water, or reverse osmosis water. Containers may be overwintered by inserting them to the rim in soils in protected locations and then covered with mulch. Dig up containers in spring to place back in sunny areas. Containers may also be brought inside in fall for overwintering in a sunny but cool area (southern window) with temperatures of 40-50 degrees F. Plants may also be grown in terrariums where humidity and moisture can be controlled. Plants often do not grow well as houseplants. Propagate by division in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dionaea muscipula, commonly called Venus fly trap, is perhaps the best known of the carnivorous plants that are native to the southeastern United States. It is native to coastal plain areas in southeastern North Carolina and eastern South Carolina (all within a 100 mile radius of Wilmington, N. C.), where it is typically found in sandy, acidic, boggy sites in marshlands, wet grasslands and savannas. Separate populations have naturalized in Florida and the New Jersey Pine Barrens. From a rhizome, this herbaceous perennial produces a low-growing rosette (to 5” tall and 8” wide) of up to eight bristly, spreading, basal leaves (each to 1-5” long), with each leaf (“trap”) being folded into two hinged lobes with bristly edges. Plant nectar lures insects into the trap. Each lobe has three sensitive trigger hairs. When an insect touches the trigger hairs, the trap slams shut imprisoning the insect until it dies and until subsequent digestion (enzymes are secreted by the leaves) takes place over the next 4-10 days. The trap then opens up in search of new prey. Cup-shaped, white flowers in umbels of 4-10 bloom in spring (May-June) on leafless stems rising well above the foliage to 12” tall. Fruits are egg-shaped capsules. Plants can be grown from seed, but it usually takes several years for them to develop. This is an endangered species which cannot be legally collected from the wild. It is also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).The genus name Dionaea comes from one of the Greek names for Venus.The specific epithet muscipula comes from Latin and means ""mousetrap"".
","
Problems
Watch for aphids and spider mites. Black spot may appear. Wild populations are threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Only purchase nursery propagated plants from reputable growers.
","
Garden Uses
Bog gardens. Also may be grown in containers, terraria (indoors under grow lights) or greenhouses. Growth as a houseplant is possible but can be difficult because of the need for growing season sun, humidity and winter dormancy. May be grown outside in low spots or other continuously moist locations, but this can also be difficult and is not recommended.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where plants are best grown in deep, fertile, organically rich, humusy, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Soils should not be allowed to dry out.  Vine needs a support structure upon which to grow to ensure foliage receives good exposure to sun.  Plants can spread invasively by seed, underground tubers and bulbils (aerial tubers).  To help prevent invasive spread, harvest tubers at the end of the growing season and replant each year plus remove and destroy bulbils that may appear.  In tropical areas, plants go dormant for about three months at the end of the rainy season.  In more temperate frost-free areas, plants lose foliage and go dormant in winter.  Propagate by dividing tubers when dormant or from root cuttings in spring or by planting bulbils in spring.  Where not winter hardy, this plant may be grown ornamentally in pots as an annual.  Plants grow best in temperatures above 70 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dioscorea alata, commonly known as water yam or winged yam, is a fast-growing, twining, tuberous-rooted, herbaceous perennial vine of the yam family (Dioscoreaeae).  It produces a large root crop of edible subterranean tubers (yams) which are an important starchy food source in many tropical to sub-tropical areas around the globe.  This species is probably the most important and extensively cultivated of the edible yams, with significant cultivation occurring in the West Indies, West Africa, Southeast Asia and Central America. 

Quadrangular purplish-winged stems (to 30’ or more) are clad with long-petioled, broad-ovate, bright green leaves (to 6-8” long) featuring 5-7 conspicuously sunken veins and cordate to arrowhead-shaped bases.  Leaves are primarily opposite, but appear alternate near the base.  Stems are herbaceous and not woody.  Monoecious yellow-white flowers appear in pendant axillary racemes (male flowers in panicles to 6-12” long and female flowers in shorter racemose spikes).  Female flowers produce three-parted capsule fruits with winged seeds.  Edible conical bulbils (aerial tubers to 4” long) sometimes form in the leaf axils.  Flowering, fruiting and bulbil production are uncommon in more temperate frost-free areas such as the southeastern U. S.  Tubers for human consumption are usually harvested at the end of a single growing season.  Unharvested tubers will increase in size from year to year with the potential of reaching gigantic dimensions over time (to 6-8’ long and to 100-150 pounds).  

This vine is probably native to Southeastern Asia, but is known today only from cultivation.  It has been suggested by some authorities that D. alata may be the result of a hybridization that took place several thousand years ago.  This yam was first introduced into Florida by Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 1500's.   It has escaped cultivation and now persists in the wild (mostly to marshes, pond margins, drainage canals and waste areas) in the southeastern U. S. from Florida and Georgia along the Gulf Coast to Louisiana.  This vine may grow as much as 6-8” per day in optimum conditions and can quickly blanket native vegetation including shrubs and tree crowns.  It is today listed as a noxious weed by the State of Florida and a Category I Invasive Plant Species by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FLEPPC).  Hundreds of cultivars exist worldwide, mostly varying in size, flesh color and texture.  

Although some varieties of sweet potato (Ipomoea) are commonly called yams in the U.S. and Canada, sweet potato belongs to the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae) and is botanically unrelated to the true yams.  From a culinary standpoint, however, true yams are considered to be a good potato substitute in hot climates where potatoes usually struggle.Genus name honors Pedanios Dioscorides, first century Greek physician and herbalist.Specific epithet from Latin means having wings in reference to the winged stems of this vine.Common name of winged yam also is in reference to the winged stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Anthracnose and viral diseases are occasional problems.  Watch for aphids, scale and mealybugs.  Nematodes may attack tubers.
","
Garden Uses
Vegetable gardens in frost free areas.  Tubers may be eaten mashed, fried, boiled or roasted.  Tubers may also be pounded to produce flour or starch.  Interesting ornamental foliage plant for trellises, porches or pergolas.  Container plant.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 (but best in Zones 8-10) where it is typically grown in deep, moist, slightly acidic, well-drained loams in full sun. Somewhat wide range of soil tolerance, but prefers moist, sandy soils. Drought tolerant. Promptly remove root suckers unless naturalized effect is desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Diospyros kaki, commonly called kaki, Japanese persimmon or Oriental persimmon, is a deciduous tree with a rounded spreading crown that typically grows to 20-30’ tall.  Outer branches may droop.  This tree is noted not only for its edible fruits but also for its excellent ornamental features.  Cultivars of this tree produce the persimmons sold in supermarkets today.  Kaki is native to India, Burma, China and Korea, and is widely cultivated in Japan.  Oval to obovate leaves (to 6"" long) emerge yellowish-green in spring, mature to glossy green in summer and turn gold to red in fall.  Trees are usually dioecious (separate male and female trees), but some trees have both male and female flowers and in some cases also some perfect flowers.  Notwithstanding the flower types, trees are parthenocarpic (may set seedless fruit without pollination).  Fragrant, non-showy flowers bloom in late spring, with the creamy-white female flowers appearing solitary and  the pink-toned male flowers appearing in clusters of three.  Edible persimmon fruits (to 3-4"" diameter) mature to bright orange in late fall, and may persist on the tree into winter.  Fruits are particularly noticeable and attractive when hanging on a tree after leaf drop.  Fruits are classified as astringent or non-astringent.  Fruits are commonly sliced or eaten whole.  Flesh may be added to salads, pancakes, cookies, jellies, jams, marmalades, syrups, puddings, ice creams or pies.  Persimmon leaves can be used to make teas.Genus name comes from the Greek dios meaning divine and pyros meaning wheat or grain for this divine fruit.Specific epithet is the Japanese name for Diospyros kaki.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Scale and mealybug may need to be controlled.  Leaf spot may occur.  Falling fruit can cause litter problems.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental landscape tree that produces an edible food crop.  May be pruned as a hedge, screen or espalier.  Trees which produce fruit should be planted in locations removed from vehicular or foot traffic.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Somewhat wide range of soil tolerance, but prefers moist, sandy soils. Drought tolerant. Promptly remove root suckers unless naturalized effect is desired. Female trees need a male pollinator in order to set fruit.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Diospyros virginiana, commonly called persimmon, is deciduous tree with a rounded oval crown that grows to 35-60’ tall. It is native from Connecticut to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rocky or dry open woods, limestone glades, prairies, thickets, abandoned fields and along roadsides (Steyermark). It is one of the easiest trees to identify in winter because of its distinctive thick, dark gray bark that is broken into rectangular blocks. Plants are usually dioecious (separate male and female trees), but some trees have perfect flowers. Fragrant, white to greenish-yellow flowers bloom in late spring, with the male flowers appearing in clusters and the female flowers appearing solitary. Edible persimmon fruits (1-2” in diameter) mature in fall to an orange to reddish-purple color, and may persist on the tree into winter. Ovate to elliptic leaves (2-6” long) are glossy dark green above, and turn yellowish-green (infrequently reddish purple) in autumn. Persimmon fruit is quite astringent when green, but upon ripening becomes sweet and may be eaten off the tree. Fruits are commonly used in syrups, jellies, ice creams or pies. Ripe fruits are too soft for shipping/sale. Persimmon leaves can be used to make teas. Persimmon is a member of the ebony family. The wood is extremely hard and has been used to make golf club heads, billiard cues and shoe lasts.Genus name comes from the Greek dios meaning divine and pyros meaning wheat or grain for this divine fruit.Specific epithet means of Virginia.

Best grown in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Foliage browns if soils dry out. Spreads by short creeping rhizomes. May form large colonies over time in optimum growing conditions. Propagate by division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Diplazium pycnocarpon, commonly called narrow-leaved glade fern, is a deciduous fern that typically grows 2-3’ tall in a circular clump of 5-6 fronds per rootstock. It is native from Quebec to Minnesota south to Louisiana and Georgia. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist woodlands in ravines and stream valleys. Fronds are somewhat dimorphic. Arching sterile fronds (to 2.5’ long) have 20-40 pairs of alternately arranged pinnae. More erect fertile fronds are taller and narrower with thinner pinnae than the sterile fronds. Sterile fronds appear in spring, but the fertile fronds develop as the summer progresses. Synonymous with Athyrium pycnocarpon. Additional common names include silvery spleenwort, narrow-leaved spleenwort and glade fern.Genus name comes from the Greek word diplasios meaning double.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs snails and other insects may damage tender fronds.

Culture
Easily grown in moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  This is a prickly biennial weed that easily escapes cultivation and naturalizes into adjacent areas by self-seeding.  Each plant can produce up to 40 flowerheads in the second year, with each flowerhead containing 900 or more seeds.  Common teasel has been declared a noxious weed in Colorado, Iowa, Missouri and New Mexico.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dipsacus fullonum, commonly known as common teasel, is a biennial that typically produces a rosette of long, pointed, oblanceolate, dark green basal leaves (to 12” long) in the first year followed by prickly upright flower stems which rise from the basal rosette to 6’ tall in the second year topped in a July-to-September bloom by stiff, spiny, cone-shaped, thistle-like, terminal flowerheads (to 3-4” tall) adorned with pinkish-white to pale lavender to pinkish purple flowers, each flower being subtended by long spiny bracts.  The bases of paired stem leaves embrace the stem forming a basin which can collect rain water.  Fruits are 4-angled achenes.  Plants die after flowering and setting seed.  

Common teasel is native to damp grassland and woodland areas of Europe, Eastern Asia and Northern Africa where it is an important winter food source for some birds.  It was first introduced into North America in the 1700s, but has now naturalized, primarily in disturbed areas, roadsides, waste areas, pond margins, pastures, grasslands, meadows, and abandoned fields, throughout most of the U.S. plus some parts of Canada (Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia).

D. sylvestris is a synonym.Genus name comes from the Greek dipsa meaning thirst (flowering stems are clad with paired leaves whose united bases form small basins which typically collect rain water).Specific epithet of fullonum and a sometimes used common name of fuller’s teasel both indicate this plant was once used in “fulling” (process of shrinking and weaving cloth after weaving).  Early wool manufacturers attached the seed heads (covered with stiff, hooked points) to a spindle for the purpose of teasing (combing) cloth to raise the nap.Additional common names for this plant include Adam’s Flannel, Church Broom, Prickly Back, and Water Thistle.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Invasive spreader.
","
Garden Uses
May not be legally planted or grown in States where it is listed as a noxious weed.  It is an otherwise interesting plant for a wild garden in States where it may be legally grown but only under circumstances where its invasive tendencies do not prove problematic.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, consistently moist, slightly acidic soils in part shade to full shade. Avoid dry soils. In full sun exposures, the foliage may bleach or burn and the fall color is less likely to be attractive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dirca palustris, commonly called leatherwood, is a small deciduous shrub that typically grows 4-6' (infrequently to 9') tall. It is native to the forest understory of eastern North America, but is uncommon in most of its range. In Missouri, it is most often found in the Ozarks in low bottom woods, rich wooded slopes, rocky wooded bluffs and along streambanks (Steyermark). Bell-shaped, pale lemon-yellow flowers (to 1/4"" long) with long yellow stamens bloom in axillary clusters along the branches in early spring (March-April) before the leaves emerge. Flowers give way to green drupes (to 1/2"" diameter) which mature in late spring to early summer. Elliptic to obovate leaves (to 3-4"" long) emerge yellow-green in spring, mature to medium green in summer and turn a pleasant bright yellow in fall. Bark is leathery, tough and strong. Twigs are extremely pliable. Native Americans used the twigs and bark for a number of purposes including making bow strings, baskets, fishing line and rope. Some people have allergic reactions to contact with the bark. The bark, fruits and roots of this shrub are toxic.Genus name comes from the Greek word dirke meaning a fountain.Specific epithet means marsh-loving in reference to the moist-to-boggy habitat preferred by this shrub.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Garden Uses
Woodland or shade gardens. Native plant areas. Pond margins and streambanks.

Best grown in evenly moist, humusy, well-drained soil in part shade. Will tolerate a range of sun conditions including full shade and full sun as long as evenly moist, well-draining soils are provided. Avoid poorly-drained, wet soils, particularly in winter. Slow and difficult to grow from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dodecatheon meadia, commonly called shooting star, is a much beloved, native Missouri wildflower that is indigenous to much of the eastern United States and typically occurs in open woods and glades, rocky wooded slopes, bluff ledges, meadows and prairies. From each basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves come 1-4 sturdy, leafless, center flower scapes rising to 20"" tall. Atop each flower scape is an umbel containing 8-20, nodding, 1"" long flowers. Each flower has five swept-back (reflexed) petals and a cluster of yellow stamens converging to a point, thus giving the flower the appearance of a shooting star plummeting to earth. Flower colors are quite variable, ranging from white to pink to light purple. Blooms in late spring.Genus name comes from the Greek words dodeka meaning twelve and theos meaning god.Specific epithet honors English physician Richard Mead (1673-1754).

Culture
Easily grown in St. Louis in containers as an indoor foliage plant where it typically thrives in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade.  Use a loamy, peaty, well-drained potting soil. Corn plant is best sited in bright indirect light locations protected from significant periods of direct sun and drafts.  Tolerates some low light.  Containers may be placed on beds of wet pebbles with regular misting of plant leaves in order to increase humidity.  Dry soils usually result in brown leaf tips.  Too much sun may prevent best foliage color from developing.  Keep soils uniformly moist during the growing season, but reduce watering from fall to late winter.  Allow soils to dry slightly between waterings, but never allow the soils to totally dry out.  Plants tolerate a wide range of indoor temperatures, but are best grown in temperatures of 60-75 degrees F.  Plant containers may be placed outdoors in summer but should always be brought back indoors in early fall before outdoor temperatures begin to dip below 50 degrees F.  This is a frost-free tropical perennial.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dracaena fragrans, commonly known as corn plant, is a popular, durable, easy-to-grow indoor  houseplant that is native to tropical Africa.  Although it may soar to 20’ tall or more in its native habitat, it more often is seen in the 4-6’ tall range as a container plant in the U.S.   Rosettes of evergreen, parallel-veined, sword-shaped, bright green leaves typically grow to 2’ long and 3” wide indoors in containers, but may reach 3’ long in outdoor locations.  Over time, plants lose their lower leaves revealing bare stems.  Fragrant, tiny, white-yellow flowers in round heads appear in terminal panicles.  Flowers may be followed by red berries.  Flowers and berries rarely appear on indoor plants, however.Genus name comes from the Greek word drakaina meaning a female dragon.Specific epithet refers the the fragrant flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Easy to grow houseplant.  Watch for spider mites, thrips and scale. Leaves may brown if soils become too moist or too dry.  Leaf spot diseases. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Culture
Easily grown as an indoor plant in St. Louis. Tolerates a wide range of indoor temperatures. For best results, place in bright indirect light locations protected from direct sun and drafts. Tolerates low light, but foliage loses best color in too much shade. Pot may be placed on a bed of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Use a loamy, peaty, well-drained potting soil. Keep soils uniformly moist during the growing season, but reduce watering from fall to late winter. Plants of different heights may be placed in the same container. Tall plants may be trimmed by removing the crown and rooting it.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dracaena marginata is a very popular houseplant that typically grows to 6’ tall or more over time unless pruned shorter. It features perhaps the narrowest leaves of the various species of dracaena sold in commerce. Slender gray upright stems are topped by tufts of arching, glossy, sword-shaped leaves (to 2’ long and 1/2” wide). Leaves are deep green with narrow reddish edges. Lower leaves fall off with age leaving distinctive diamond-shaped leaf scars on the stems. In its native habitat of Madagascar, this species grows as a shrub or small tree to 20’ tall. Fragrant tiny white flowers in spring are followed by spherical yellow-orange beries. Flowers and berries rarely appear on indoor plants. This plant is also sometimes called Spanish dagger or red-stemmed dracaena or Madagascar dragon tree. ‘Tricolor’ is a popular cultivar which adds a thin yellow stripe to each leaf.Genus name comes from the Greek word drakaina meaning a female dragon.Specific epithet refers to the plants distinctive leaf margin.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12. Easily grown as an indoor plant in St. Louis. Use a loamy, peaty, well-drained potting soil. Keep soils uniformly moist but not wet. Leaf tips and margins may brown if soils become too wet or too dry. For best results, site plants in areas with bright indirect light. Plants should be protected from direct sun (except for limited early morning sun) and drafts (plants are sensitive to cold). In too much shade, plants may grow spindly with the variegated leaves losing their variegation. Plants like high humidity and consistent year-round temperatures. Pots may be placed on a bed of wet pebbles to increase humidity. Foliage may be regularly misted with water. Room temperatures should not dip lower than 65 degrees F. Plant stems may need staking or other support as they grow taller with age. Plants may be propagated by stem cuttings.

Dracaena reflexa (synonymous with and formerly known as Pleomele reflexa) is a tropical shrub or small tree that is native to Madagascar, Mauritius and some additional nearby islands in the Indian Ocean. Although plants in the wild may grow to 18' tall or more, houseplants will typically grow much shorter (upright-oval to 3-6' tall). Container plants usually have multiple stems. Species plants have dark green narrow-lanceolate to elliptic leaves (to 4-6"" long) with parallel veins. Leaves are spirally arranged in whorls. Lower leaves will die off over time, revealing interesting stems. Tiny white flowers in clusters are not particularly showy. Flowers are sometimes followed by orange-red berries. Indoor plants infrequently flower and fruit. Genus name from Greek means female dragon. Flower inflorescences are often reflexed (bent downward), hence the specific epithet. Common name of Song of India is in apparent reference to this plant's native range in the Indian Ocean.Genus name comes from the Greek word drakaina meaning a female dragon.Specific epithet means bent back sharply.'Variegata' is a popular variegated form that is commonly grown indoors as a foliage ornamental in homes, offices, shopping malls and hotels in many parts of the world. Its leaves are deep green with yellow-lime green margins when young, maturing over time to a lighter green with creamy margins.

Culture
Annual that is easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Perhaps best in moist, organically rich soils. Tolerates light shade. Also tolerates heat, drought and a wide range of soil conditions except poorly-drained wet ones. For best results from seed in the St. Louis area, start seed indoors around March 1. Set out seedlings in the garden after last frost date. Seed may also be sown directly in the garden at last frost date. Deadhead spend flowers to encourage additional bloom and/or to prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Will remain in the garden through self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dracopis amplexicaulis is sometimes called clasping coneflower because its leaves clasp the stems. It is an annual that is native from Georgia to Texas north to Missouri and Kansas. In Missouri, it is typically found along roadsides, waste areas, along streams and in prairies in several counties in the western part of the state (Steyermark). This is a small-flowered glabrous composite that resembles Mexican hat (see Ratibida) in flower shape. It typically grows 18-24” tall. Flowers (to 2” across) feature columnar dark brown center disks (to 1” long), each with 5-10 drooping yellow ray flowers which may have orange or brownish-purple at the ray bases. Blooms in summer. Oblong to ovate leaves (to 4” long) are toothed to entire and clasp the stem. Steyermark lists this plant in the monotypic genus Dracopis, distinguishing it from Rudbeckia by the presence of chaff subtending the ray flowers. Synonymous with Rudbeckia amplexicaulis.Genus name come from the Greek drakon meaning dragon for the appendages on the style.Specific epithet means stem-clasping.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, rich soils. Spreads by self-seeding and bulb offsets. Plants are not reliably winter hardy throughout the St. Louis area where mulch should be applied in winter to help protect them from cold temperatures. In cold winter areas north of USDA Zone 6, tubers may be dug up in autumn, overwintered indoors and replanted in spring in somewhat the same manner as dahlias.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dracunculus vulgaris, commonly called dragon arum, is a tuberous herbaceous perennial that is native to rocky areas and hillsides in the central to eastern Mediterranean areas from Greece to the Balkans to Turkey. It typically grows to 3' tall and features large, erect, fan-shaped, palmately-divided, dark green leaves (to 12"" long) that are often streaked with white. Each leaf has 9-15 finger-like lobes reportedly resembling in appearance the claw of a dragon, hence the common name. Leaves appear in clusters on a stalk-like, black/purple-spotted pseudostem. Large, foul-smelling, maroon-purple spathes (each to as much as 20"" long and 8"" wide) appear above the leaves in late spring/early summer. The foul odor of the spathes, sometimes described as akin to the nauseous aroma of rotten meat, attracts flies for pollinating the flowers. Each spathe envelops a central, upright, nearly black, tail-like spike (spadix) which is nearly as long as the spathe, but sometimes longer, with a diameter of only 1/2 to 3/4"". The spathe contains inconspicuous, hidden, unisexual flowers. Flowers are followed by green berries which mature to orange-red in fall. This plant is synonymous with and formerly called Arum dracunculus.Genus name comes from the Latin word meaning a small dragon.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Shady garden areas. Avoid planting this perennial near windows, doors, sidewalks or other frequently populated areas where the brief but overpowering odor from the spadices will be found objectionable.

Dryopteris celsa, commonly called log fern, is a woodland fern which is native to moist woods and swamps in the southeastern U.S. west to Missouri and Arkansas, with additional populations along the east coast ranging as far north as New York. The Missouri populations are limited to three counties in the southern Ozark region along the Arkansas border (Steyermark). This is a naturally occurring hybrid of  D. goldiana  and  D. ludoviciana  which is often found growing on rotting logs, hence the common name. Typically grows in an upright habit to 3-4' tall and features firm, erect, deeply cut, shiny dark green fronds with contrasting dark central stipes (stems). Fronds are semi evergreen.Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dryopteris clintoniana, commonly called Clinton’s wood fern, is a semi-evergreen fern that is native to swamps and moist woodland areas in northeastern North America. It is reportedly a fertile hybrid between  D. goldiana  and  D. cristata , sharing characteristics of both species. It typically grows in an irregular clump to 2-4’ tall with pinnate-pinnatifid fronds, each having 14-16 pairs of pinnae above the triangular basal pinnae. Its fertile fronds are deciduous and typically taller, more upright but thinner than the sterile fronds. Sterile fronds are evergreen to semi-evergreen in winter. Some confusion exists over nomenclature for this plant. It is generally considered synonymous with  D. cristata  var.  clintoniana .Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.Specific epithet honors George William Clinton (1807-1885), founder and developer of the Clinton Herbarium in Buffalo, New York.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dryopteris filix-mas, commonly called male fern, is native to Europe and North America.  This is a large, arching, deciduous male fern with erect, stout rhizomes and medium green blades (fronds) that grow to 3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall.  Blade is pinnate-pinnatifid (almost 2-pinnate) with 20-30 pair of long-pointed pinnae (leaflets) per blade.  Each leaflet is divided into short, rounded, finely-serrated pinnules (sub-leaflets).  Sori (fruit dots) on the leaflets are located closer to the midvein than the margin.  Crisped, crested, forked and dwarf variants of this species exist.  In North America, this fern ranges from Newfoundland to British Columbia, from New England to the Great Lakes, and from South Dakota to Washington south to California and Texas.  It is typically found in cool, moist, rocky woods, but in New England it is uncommon and limited only to areas with calcareous soils.  In Europe, it is commonly found in a variety of locations including roadsides.Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.Specific epithet means male fern in reference to the somewhat vigorous growing habits of ferns in this species.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dryopteris intermedia, commonly called evergreen wood fern, glandular wood fern to fancy fern, is a rhizomatous wood fern that is native to moist woodland areas, ravines, swamp margins and rocky slopes in Eastern North America from Newfoundland to Ontario to Minnesota south to Missouri and Georgia.  It is common through much of its range, but uncommon in Missouri where it is typically found on shaded ledges and sandstone bluffs.  It was formerly known as Dryopteris spinulosa var. intermedia, and is very similar in appearance to Dryopteris carthusiana (formerly known as Dryopteris spinulosa) from which it is primarily distinguished by (a) length of pinnules on lowest pair of pinnae being usually shorter than the length of the next pinnule and (b) glandular leaf blades.    

This is a lacy evergreen wood fern that typically grows to 1-3’ tall with upright arching fronds to 40” long and 8” wide.  Frond leaflets are lobed and toothed.  Oval to narrow triangular, thrice-cut, finely dissected blade has 10-15 pairs of narrow lance-shaped pinnae (leaflets).  Sori (fruit dots) appear on the leaflet undersides on fertile fronds in early to mid-summer.Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.Specific epithet means intermediate in probable reference to this fern being between D. carthusiana and D. campyloptera.

Culture
Best grown in evenly moist, rich, humusy, well-draining soils in part shade to full shade. Hardy in Zones 6-9. Winter protection is recommended in the colder parts of its hardiness range. Prefers climates with cool summers. Does not produce offsets, so spores are typically the only means of propagation. The foliage can become a bit dilapidated over the winter, and can be cut back in early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dryopteris wallichiana, commonly called wood fern, alpine wood fern, or Wallich's wood fern, is a semi-evergreen, clump-forming, perennial fern with a widespread distribution. It is found growing in cool, mountainous forests in Japan, Hawaii, Mexico, China, and the foothills of the Himalayas. This fern has a vase-shaped habit, and can reach up to 5' tall with a 3' spread. The emerging fiddle heads are covered in fine, red hairs. The sturdy, dark green fronds (up to 4' long) are generally lanceolate in shape with finely dissected, lobed pinnae (leaflets) and a dark brown to black rachis (mid-rib). These are typically solitary plants that do not form colonies.Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.The specific epithet wallichiana honors Dr. Nathaniel Wallich (1786-1854) a Danish botanist and surgeon who lived and worked for most of his career in Kolkata (Calcutta), India. He collected extensively in India, Nepal, and Myanmar (Burma).

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where plants are grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but best flowering is in full sun. Tolerates wide range of soils. Grow as an annual shrub, in containers or as a houseplant in the St. Louis area. Container plants must be brought inside in fall before first frost for overwintering in a bright sun room.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Duranta erecta, commonly called golden dewdrop, pigeon berry or sky flower, is native from Florida to Brazil and in the West Indies. It is a spreading, sometimes weeping, evergreen shrub or small tree that grows to 15-18’ tall in its native habitat. In St. Louis it is typically grown as a 2-4’ tall annual shrub or in containers that must be overwintered indoors. Sharp axillary thorns are usually present on stems of mature plants, but are usually absent on young plants. Features drooping axillary and terminal racemes of light blue to violet flowers which bloom summer to fall. Flowers give way in fall to drooping clusters of yellow-orange drupes (golden dewberries as it were). Fruit often does not appear on plants grown in the St. Louis area. Oval rounded light green leaves (to 2” long).Genus name honors Castore Durante (c.1529-1590), Papal physician and botanist in Rome.Specific epithet means upright or erect.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for whiteflies. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Hedge, border plant, lawn specimen or train as small tree in warm climates. In St. Louis, grow as annual, in containers, houseplant or greenhouses.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is best grown in rich, moist but well-drained soils in bright part shade areas.  Tolerates full sun.  Houseplants prefer consistent moisture in mostly sunny exposures with high humidity.  Direct full sun indoors may scorch the foliage.  Houseplants dislike temperatures that drop below 60 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dypsis lutescens, commonly called bamboo palm, butterfly palm or areca palm, is native to moist forest areas in Madagascar.   Although endangered in its native habitat, it is commonly available in commerce throughout the world for outdoor plantings (where winter hardy) or as a houseplant.  This multi-stemmed palm is now considered to be the most popular palm sold as a houseplant.  Outdoors it will typically grow to 12-30' tall.  Multiple-ringed, cane-like, yellow stems grow from the base of the plant in clusters.  Stems sometimes resemble bamboo when suckers are removed, hence the common name of bamboo palm.  Stems are topped with pinnate, upward-curving, light green leaves (to 3-6' long) with yellow midribs.  Each leaf has 40-60 1/2 to 3/4"" lance-shaped leaflets per side.   Yellow flowers bloom in summer in panicles to 2' long.  Flowers are not particularly showy.  Flowers are followed by small yellow-orange fruits (each to 1/2"" long) that mature to nearly black.  Another common name for this palm is golden cane palm in reference to its yellow stems.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Chrysalidocarpus lutescens.Specific epithet means turning yellow in reference to the yellow flowers, stems and leaf midribs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Lethal yellowing is a significant and deadly phytoplasma disease of palms (spread by planthoppers) that may occur on plants grown outdoors.  Insect pests include scale and whiteflies.  Watch for spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, it may be grown in groups as a landscape specimen.  Excellent screen, informal hedge or privacy wall.  Very popular indoor houseplant.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 9 where it is easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Best in rich soils.  Tolerates poor soils.  Propagate from seed in spring.  Produces flowers and fruits in the first year when grown from seed.   This vine lacks tendrils, hence it must be secured to upright supports by the gardener unless it is simply being grown as a groundcover.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ecballium elaterium, commonly known as squirting cucumber or exploding cucumber, is a frost-tender, weak-stemmed, herbaceous perennial vine of the gourd family that typically grows to 12-18” tall, but clambers and trails along the ground, often in an aggressive sprawling fashion, to 36” wide.  It is the sole species of the genus Ecballium.  It is native to hot dry areas of disturbed ground, fields, farmland, rocky/stony areas, and roadsides in the Mediterranean region of southern Europe. 

This vine is most noted for its prickly, oblong, unusual and distinctive, blue-green fruit pods which mature in fall in a form somewhat resembling a small 3-inch cucumber.   Each fruit pod contains many black seeds.  The pods explode when ripe, squirting and distributing plant seeds in a sticky mucilaginous liquid to distances of 6-18’ or more.

Foliage and flowers are not particularly attractive in most garden areas.  Leaves are bristly, cordate and wrinkled with small lobed margins.  Unisexual, bell-shaped, yellow flowers (each flower being either male or female) bloom on the same plant throughout summer.  Female flowers are solitary but male flowers appear in short racemes.  Female flowers give way to squirting cucumber fruit pods.

Tuberous roots have historically been used over the past 2000 years in the preparation of certain herbal medicines.Genus name comes from the Greek ekballein meaning to cast out in reference to the explosive discharge of ripe seeds in fall.Specific epithet is the name of the drug elaterium which is a powerful purgative prepared from plant juices.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Narrow-leaf purple coneflower is a compact perennial that is primarily native to upland dry prairie areas in the Great Plains. In Missouri, it has only been found in Shelby County in the northeastern part of the state (Steyermark). It is very similar to E. pallida which grows east of its range. It is a small coneflower that grows 1-2’ tall on rigid, upright, hairy stems clad with narrow, lanceeolate to ovate green leaves (to 4-6” long). Flowers (to 3” diameter) feature light pink to pale purple rays that spread outward and usually droop. Orange-brown center cones. Flowers bloom in June and July, sometimes with sporadic continued bloom throughout the summer. Goldfinches are attracted to the seeds that form in the center cones. Echinacea comes from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog in reference to the spiny center cone. Angustifolia means narrow-leaved.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Echinacea pallida, commonly known as pale purple coneflower,  is a coarse, hairy perennial of prairies, savannahs, glades and open dry rocky woods from Nebraska to Michigan south to Georgia and Texas.  It features narrow, parallel-veined, toothless, dark green leaves (4-10” long) and large, daisy-like flowers with drooping, pale pinkish-purple petals (ray flowers) and spiny, knob-like, coppery-orange center cones.  Flowers appear on rigid stems to 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall over a long summer bloom.  This species is distinguished by (a) thin, extremely-reflexed rays which almost droop straight down and (b) very narrow, parallel-veined leaves which have no teeth. Best flower display is in late June to late July, with sporadic continued bloom into autumn.Genus name of Echinacea comes from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet means pale in probable reference to the pale pinkish-purple petals.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Echinacea paradoxa, sometimes called yellow coneflower, is the only species in the genus Echinacea to have yellow flowers instead of the usual purple flowers (this being the paradox suggested by the species name). It primarily occurs on glades and prairies in the Ozark regions of Missouri and Arkansas. Features large, daisy-like flowers with drooping yellow to orange-yellow petals (ray flowers) and very large, coppery-brown to chocolate-brown central cones. Best flower display is mid-June to mid-July, sometimes with sporadic continued bloom throughout the summer. Flowers grow on rigid, glabrous stems typically to 3' tall. Smooth, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (4-8"" long) with linear veining. The dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter and, if flower heads are not removed, are often visited by goldfinches who perch on or just below the blackened cones to feed on the seeds. he Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog in reference to the spiny center cone.Genus name of Echinacea comes from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet calls attention to the paradox of why this species of Echinacea has yellow flowers instead of the usual purple.

Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Must be grown in isolation from other species of Echinacea (several miles) in order to harvest seed that retains the genetic integrity of the endangered species. Moreover, if planted with other species or cultivars of Echinacea, it may be crowded out due to its less vigorous growth habit.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Echinacea tennesseensis, commonly known as Tennessee coneflower, is a U.S. native plant. It is only known to exist naturally on certain glades near Nashville, Tennessee, and is on the Federal Endangered Species List. A daisy-like coneflower which features slightly upturned, rose-purple petals (ray flowers) and spiny, coppery center disks with a green tinge. Long summer bloom period from June until August. Flowers grow on rigid stems up to 2.5' tall, with dark green, linear foliage. This species is very similar to E. purpurea (Missouri native), except that E. tennesseensis is somewhat less vigorous and smaller, and has shorter, more upturned ray flowers, a vertical rootstock and more narrow, linear leaves.Genus name of Echinacea comes from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet means of Tennessee.

Culture
Easily grown in average, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, including poor dryish ones, as long as the soils are well-drained.  Plants may be grown from seed and will self-seed in the garden if not deadheaded.  Deadheading the flowers will extend the bloom period, however.  Once the taproot has matured, this plant is very difficult to transplant or divide without seriously damaging the taproot.  Plants may be trimmed to the ground in late fall or left as is for winter interest.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Echinops sphaerocephalus, commonly known as great globe-thistle, is a bold, woolly-stemmed perennial in the thistle tribe of the composite (sunflower) family.  It is native to meadows, fields, rocky brushy places and disturbed habitats in Europe and western Asia, but has been introduced in other places around the world including North America where it has naturalized over time in a number of locations in Canada from Quebec to Saskatchewan and in the U.S. from Maine to Minnesota south to Illinois, Kentucky and Virginia plus Wyoming, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California.  

Upright-branching gray stems typically rise to 3’ tall and to 2-3’ wide, but infrequently in the wild soar to as much as 4-7’ tall.  Stems are clad with coarse, glandular, sinuate-pinnatifid, deeply dissected, thistle-like, green to gray-green leaves (to 14” long) which have spiny-toothed margins and white tomentose undersides.  Each stem is topped in summer (late June- August) with a showy, thistle-like, spherical inflorescence (to 2” diameter) filled with lilac-white disk florets (rays absent).   Fruits are hairy cylindrical achenes (1/3”) which ripen from September to October.Genus name comes from the Greek words echinos meaning a hedgehog and ops meaning appearance in reference to the flower heads.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words sphaera meaning round and kephalos meaning head in reference to the flower heads being of spherical shape.

Culture
Best grown outdoors in moderately fertile, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates temperatures to as low as 20-25 degrees F.   Tolerates average soils.  As a biennial, this plant will produce a basal clump of foliage the first year from which rise flowering spikes in the second year.  It will easily remain in the landscape by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Echium candicans, commonly known as Pride of Madeira, is an evergreen, mounding, rapid-growing, biennial or short-lived perennial subshrub that typically matures to 5-6’ tall spreading to 6-10’ wide.  It is endemic to the island of Madiera where it grows on rocky cliffs and terraces in the Central Mountain Massif at elevations ranging from 2,500’ to 4,600’.   It is a shrubby spreading plant that has escaped cultivation and naturalized in a number of areas around the world where it has been introduced, including parts of southern California where it is now listed as an invasive plant in some locations.  In the first year, each plant produces a basal rosette of prominently veined, narrow, lanceolate to elliptic, hairy gray-green leaves (each to 6-10” long).  In the second year, woody, unbranched, spire-like flowering stalks rise above the foliage rosette to 20” tall, each stalk bearing from late spring through summer showy cylindrical terminal panicles (to 12” long) of small but abundant narrow bluish-purple to white flowers with protruding reddish stamens.  Flowers give way to nutlets.

E. fastuosum is a synonym.Echium is the Greek name for this plant.  It is derived from echis which means viper in reference to (a) the nutlet shape which resembles the head of a viper and (b) the ancient medicinal use of the plant root as a treatment for snakebite.Specific epithet means shining or wooly white.

Culture
Biennial or cool weather annual. As a biennial, this plant will produce a basal clump of foliage the first year from which rise flowering spikes the second year. As an annual, plants can flower and seed in the first year if started early. It is easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates poor soils. Rich fertile soils produce excess foliage with fewer flowers. Plants will freely self-seed in the landscape, sometimes aggressively. Remove flowering spikes before nutlets mature to limit unwanted self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Echium vulgare, know as viper’s bugloss, blue devil, blue thistle and blueweed, is native to southern Europe, but has naturalized over much of North America (except the far southeast and southwest) where it is most commonly found in pastures, fields, disturbed sites, waste places and roadsides. Its reputation among gardeners runs the gamut from an aggressive weed to attractive wildflower. It is a taprooted plant that grows 1-2.5’ tall with bristly hairs on the leaves and stems. As a biennial, it produces a basal clump of lance-shaped leaves (to 6” long and 1.5” wide) in the first year. Leaves are speckled with white. In the second year, an erect flowering stalk (green spotted with purple) rises from the basal clump to 2.5’ tall. Funnel-shaped blue flowers (to 3/4” long) with protruding red stamens bloom from late May to September along the upper parts of the flowering stalk. Flowers give way to rough nutlets and the plant then dies. Bugloss comes from Greek and means ox tongue in reference to the shape and rough texture of the leaves. Plants were once used as a treatment for snake/viper bites. Plant nutlets are reported to resemble snake/viper heads.Echium is the Greek name for this plant.  It is derived from echis which means viper in reference to (a) the nutlet shape which resembles the head of a viper and (b) the ancient medicinal use of the plant root as a treatment for snakebite.Specific epithet means common.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is best grown in humus-rich, moist but well-drained soils in part shade.  Needs protection from hot afternoon sun.  Intolerant of hot dry summers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Edgeworthia chrysantha, commonly called paperbush or edgeworthia, is a deciduous suckering shrub that typically grows to 4-6’ tall and as wide.  It is native to woodland areas in the Himalayas and China.  Short-stalked, lanceolate-oblong, dark green leaves (to 3-5” long and 2” wide) are crowded near the branch ends.  Alternate, narrow-oval, dull dark green leaves (to 5” long and 2” wide) are gray-green beneath.  No fall color.  Young leaves are covered with silky white hairs.  Tiny, apetalous, tubular, yellow flowers are compacted into dense, rounded, umbelliferous flower heads (up to 40 flowers per head).  Flower buds begin to form in late summer each year, overwinter on the bare stems and burst into bloom from late February to early April before the new leaves emerge.  Silvery winter flower buds and brown branching are ornamentally attractive.  Fruits are dry drupes.   

Inner bark can be used to make quality paper as indicated by the common name of paperbush.  Plants are widely cultivated in Japan for use in making the paper used in the production of Japanese banknotes.  

Some confusion currently exists in regard to the nomenclature for this plant.  Some experts believe that Edgeworthia chrysantha (specific epithet refers to golden flowers) and Edgeworthia papyrifera (specific epithet refers to paper producing bark) are synonyms.  Both were submitted for publication about the same time in the mid 1800s, but the former was slightly prior in time to the latter.  Assuming these plants are synonyms, the preferred name should be Edgeworthia chrysantha based upon the general rule that first-in-time prevails.  On the other hand, some confusion still exists because The Plant List currently lists both of these species as synonyms of Edgeworthia tomentosa.Genus name honors Michael Pakenham Edgeworth (1812-1881), Irish-born botanist, and his half sister Maria Edgeworth.  Michael spent much of his life working in India where he was employed by the Indian Civil Service from 1831 to 1881.Specific epithet means having yellow flowers.

Culture
A frost-tender aquatic perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where it can be quite invasive. In St. Louis, it will generally not survive winter and is often grown as an annual. It is easily grown on still water in full sun. Needs hot summer weather and full sun to bloom. Scatter small bunches of plants on the water surface after last frost date. Plants spread quickly in optimum conditions by stolons that radiate outward from the mother plant. Remove excess plants as needed. Several plants may be lifted in fall before frost for overwintering in containers of wet, sandy loam in bright light at indoor temperatures of 60-70 degrees F. However, many St. Louis gardeners prefer to grow water hyacinth as an annual by simply repurchasing new plants each spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eichhornia crassipes, commonly called water hyacinth, is native to Brazil. It is a free-floating, frost-tender aquatic perennial that is commonly used as an ornamental plant in water gardens. It produces rosettes of thick, leathery, ovate to rounded, glossy green leaves with inflated, bulbous leaf petioles that act as floats. Plants spread rapidly by stolons to form a dense mat of foliage (to 6” tall). Spikes of lilac to lavender flowers bloom atop erect stalks to 6-9” tall in summer. Each flowering spike typically has 8-15 flowers. One petal of each flower has a yellow spot at the base. Long greenish-purple roots dangle downward from the plants, providing shelter and spawning areas for many small fish. As an ornamental water garden plant, water hyacinth provides attractive flowers and dense foliage that inhibits growth of algae and helps keep water clear. The value of this plant is directly related to the climate in which it grows. In warm climates where it survives winter, water hyacinth is considered to be a noxious weed because of its ability to rapidly cover a pond or lake from shore to shore and to choke waterways. It has naturalized in the deep South in states such as Florida, Louisiana and Texas where expensive eradication programs have been implemented. It is included on the Federal List of Noxious Weeds. Several southern states have banned its sale. On the other hand, in areas where the plants are not winter hardy, they are being purposefully introduced into wastewater areas to clean up the water because they not only absorb many common pollutants but also absorb some toxic pesticides and heavy metals. Steyermark reports small populations in the Southeast lowlands area of Missouri.Genus name honors J. A. Fr. Eichhorn (1779-1856), Prussian minister of education.Specific epithet means thick-footed or thick-stemmed.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. An invasive species in mild winter climates.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in light, sandy loams in full sun. This is a vigorous, fast-growing plant that tolerates a wide variety of soils including both poor dry soils and wet heavy clays. Also tolerates wind, summer heat and saline conditions. Performs poorly in humid summer climates, however, and is not recommended for planting in the deep South (south of USDA Zone 7). Can spread by root suckers and self seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elaeagnus angustifolia, commonly called Russian olive or oleaster is native to Europe and Asia. It is a small, usually thorny, deciduous tree or large shrub that is typically grown for its silvery foliage, small fragrant yellow flowers, olive-like fruit and ease of cultivation. It has been widely planted in North America as both a windbreak and an ornamental. As a tree, it typically grows 12-20’ tall. It responds well to clipping and can be grown much shorter as a hedge. Branches and trunk are covered with exfoliating brown bark that is attractive in winter. Twigs are occasionally thorny. Narrow, willow-like leaves (to 2” long) are dark green above and silvery beneath. Angustifolia means narrow-leaved. Fragrant apetalous flowers with four lobed calyces appear in clusters of 1-3 in leaf axils near the base of new shoots in late spring. Flowers are silvery white outside and yellowish inside. Flowers are followed in fall by an often abundant crop of berry-like, silver-scaled fruit resembling olives, hence the common name. Fruit is edible, and is sometimes used for making preserves. Fruit is also attractive to wildlife. Although relatively tame in the St. Louis climate, Russian olive has aggressively naturalized in many parts of the West, particularly in watersheads and marshlands of the Great Plains where it has self-seeded and spread along rivers and wetland areas, crowding out native plants such as cottonwoods and willows, to the point where it is now being considered a noxious weed.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.

Problems
Canker and verticillium wilt are serious problems in some areas. Fungal leaf spot and rust may also occur.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elaeagnus multiflora, commonly called goumi or gumi, is a deciduous to semi-evergreen shrub that typically grows in a rounded form to 6-10' tall.  It is noted for producing edible bright red berry-like fruits (reminiscent of small cherries) in summer.  It is native to open woodlands, thickets and wood margins in China and Japan.  Young branchlets are covered with brown scales.  Mature ovate leaves (to 2"" long) are dark green above but silver dotted with tiny brown scales beneath.  Small, apetalous, bell-shaped, silvery-white flowers (to 5/8"" long) bloom in spring (April-May) with fruit appearing in summer (July).  Flowers are not particularly showy, but are pleasantly fragrant.   Small, one-seeded, berry-like fruits (oblong drupes to 1/2"" long) ripen to a showy bright red in summer.  Fruits are quite astringent and should not be eaten fresh off the shrub prior to attaining full ripeness.  Fully ripe fruits are juicy, sweet and tart, and may be eaten fresh off the shrub, dried or cooked (pies or preserves).Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means many flowered.

Elaeagnus pungens, commonly called thorny elaeagnus or silverthorn, is native to China and Japan.  It is a large, sprawling, durable, broad-leaved evergreen shrub that typically grows to 12-15' tall.  Young branchlets are covered with brown scales.  Branchlets are usually spiny.  Wavy-margined, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3.5"" long) are lustrous green above but silvery-white and dotted with tiny brown scales below.  Small, apetalous, bell-shaped, creamy white flowers (to 1/4"" long) bloom in axillary clusters in late fall (October-November).  Flowers are not particularly showy, but are intensely fragrant (some suggest gardenia-scented).  Small, one-seeded, reddish-brown fruits (drupes to 1/2"" long) typically ripen in spring (late March-May).  Fruits are technically edible, but perhaps best left for the birds.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means sharp-pointed in reference to the sharp thorny spines found on this species.Common names are also in reference to the spines.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 4-9 where it is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  This is a nitrogen-fixing shrub/small tree that tolerates a wide variety of soils including poor unfavorable ones.  It prefers consistently moist soil conditions, but is tolerant of drought.  Avoid wet, poorly-drained soils.  

A single autumn olive plant can produce an abundant annual crop of edible fruits (to 80 pounds) containing up to 200,000 seeds.  Birds and animals consume the fruits and help distribute the seed.  Autumn olive has been found to easily out-compete, suppress and displace native plants in the landscape through rapid growth, root suckering, and self-seeding, resulting in the creation of dense shady areas that prevent continued growth of nearby plants which require sunny conditions to survive.  This shrub is now listed as an invasive species in a number of States in the central and eastern U.S. including several States where it has been banned for sale, distribution or cultivation.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elaeagnus umbellata, commonly called autumn olive or autumnberry, is a large deciduous shrub or small sprawling tree of the Oleaster family that typically matures to 10-16’ tall and to 20-30’ wide.  It is native to China, Japan and Korea.  It was introduced into the U.S. from Japan in 1830, with initial uses including strip mine reclamation areas, ornamental shrub applications and wildlife cover/food.  Rapid growth, vigorous growing habits, showy-edible fruits and attractive appearance led the U.S. Soil Conservation Service in the 1950s to recommend this shrub for a number of different purposes including windbreaks, erosion control, highway beautification, wildlife habitat, and wildlife food (fruits).  These recommendations were quickly retracted, however, as soon as the invasive characteristics of the plant became better known.  Plants have naturalized over time with the current U.S. habitat now primarily including disturbed areas, thickets, forest margins, meadows, fields, roadsides, and fencerows in the central and eastern U.S.  

Several woody stems/trunks rise up from the base of this shrub, with the largest trunks eventually maturing to as much as 6” in diameter.  Trunks/branches have sharp thorns.  Autumn olive is often found in dense impenetrable thickets.  Arching trunks produce arching branches which often dip to the ground.  Bark on older trunks peels in long, thin, narrow strips.  

Features  of this species include:  (a) speckled, often thorny stems which are silvery or golden brown; (b) leathery elliptic leaves (2-3” long) with entire but often wavy margins which are grayish green with distinctive silver scales on the undersides;  (c) fragrant, funnel-shaped, 4-petaled,  silvery white to dull yellow flowers (each to 1/3” long) which bloom during the period of late April to early June in clusters (1-4 flowered umbels) drooping from the leaf axils; (d) fleshy, abundant, scale-dotted, edible fruits which ripen to a speckled red in early fall (September-October);  (e) abundant seeds, many of which are widely disseminated by birds to often distant locations.       

Fully ripe fruits are juicy, sweet and tart, and may be eaten fresh off the shrub, dried or cooked (pies, jams or preserves).Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word umbellatus meaning bearing umbels in reference to the flowers appearing in axillary umbels.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Japanese beetles and 17 year locusts feed on the leaves.
","
Garden Uses
Invasive features of this shrub outweigh its ornamental assets.  It is illegal to purchase, sell or cultivate this shrub in some areas.  Where not illegal, it is remains an invasive plant that should not be planted or grown in any residential area (particularly in the central and eastern U.S.) where it is likely to spread.  

In areas where it is not considered to be invasive, it can be used as an effective background plant, screen or informal hedge.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In warm areas where plants will survive winter outdoors, grow in mud/moist sandy loams or as marginals in water to 6” deep in full sun to part shade. Plants can be grown in ponds, bogs or other shallow water areas. Propagate by dividing the tubers. In St. Louis, plants will not survive winter outdoors, but (1) they may be overwintered indoors in containers in bright indoor light, or (2) the tubers can be harvested for storage in moist conditions until spring or (3) the tubers can simply be harvested for use as food. Plants can also be grown as annuals by repurchasing tubers each spring at an Asian grocery store. Plants generally need a frost-free growing season of about seven months in order to produce a good crop of tubers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eleocharis dulcis, commonly called Chinese water chestnut, is a tuberous, rush-like, marginal aquatic perennial that is probably grown more often for its edible, dark brown tubers (corms) than it is grown for ornamental purposes. Plants produce horizontal rhizomes that terminate in rounded tubers. The tubers are commonly used in Asian cooking. They may be eaten raw or cooked, and are noted for their sweetness and distinctive nut-like crunch. These plants are commercially cultivated in China and Japan for the tubers. Each tuber produces a dense clump of erect, branchless, green stems, many of which are topped by a cylindrical, straw-brown, flower spikelet (to 2” long). Flowering is uncommon for plants growing in the St. Louis area. Stem leaves are bladeless sheaths, with the stems actually providing the photosynthesis for the plant. Synonymous with Eleocharis tuberosa.Specific epithet means sweet.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental for water gardens or bog gardens or along streams. Harvest the tubers.

Culture
Best in full sun to part shade.  Plants are typically grown in ponds, bogs or other shallow water areas, including sites that are permanently or seasonally flooded.  Can grow in water up to 3' deep.  In situations where flood waters gradually disappear over summer, plants can still survive in fall as long as soils are saturated.  Spreads by rhizomes.  Propagate by dividing the rhizomes.  Plants may self-seed.  Plant new plants (plugs is the  best way) 12-18"" apart in saturated soils (best with no more than 3"" of standing water  during the first growing season).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eleocharis palustris, commonly called creeping spike rush, is a rhizomatous, wetland obligate perennial of the sedge family.  It is native to marshes, wet meadows, springs, rivers, pond/lake margins, shores, ditches and brackish waters throughout the U. S., Canada, Europe and Asia.  Round, upright, green stems rise singly or in clusters from plant rhizomes.  Stems appear leafless (true leaves are bladeless reddish sheaths clustered at the base of each stem).  Stems may grow to as much as 4' tall (height is dependent on the depth of the water in which the plant is growing).  The stems provide the photosynthesis for the plant.  Each stem is topped by a solitary terminal spikelet of inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers.  Plants flower from June to September.  Flowers are followed by conical scaly yellow-brown seedheads.Genus name comes from the Greek words elos meaning marsh and charis meaning grace.Specific epithet means of marshes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids.
","
Garden Uses
Rarely used as an ornamental plant.  Water gardens, bog gardens, ponds  or along streams.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Elephantopus carolinianus, commonly called Elephant's foot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States where it is found growing in low woods, along streambanks, roadsides, and in pastures. In Missouri this species is primarily found in counties south of the Missouri River. Valued for its late summer to fall bloom and large, attractive lower leaves. Bloom consists of many small flower heads which are arranged in compound inflorescences. Each individual flower head is subtended by (rests upon) leafy bracts and contains 2-5, tubular, pale lavender disc florets. When in full bloom, an entire inflorescence may be mistaken for a large, single bloom. Although a member of the composite family, the flowers of elephant's foot are not daisy-like in appearance because each flower head contains only disc flowers. Similar in appearance and closely related to the ironweeds (genus Vernonia).Specific epithet means from North or South Carolina.The common name elephant's foot refers to the large basal leaves of this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Suitable for use in native plant gardens, meadows and woodland gardens. Marginal ornamental attributes for perennial borders. Large lower leaves can form a nice ground cover if plants are massed. Has the potential to become aggressive and weedy in garden settings.

Culture
Cardamom will thrive when grown under the shade of tall trees in hot, humid, consistently moist, tropical rainforest conditions where daily temperatures infrequently dip below 72 degrees F.  Flowers and fruits will appear only when plants are grown under tropical conditions.  Plant growth in general will suffer significant injury if temperatures dip below 50 degrees F.  Plants appreciate rainforest-type conditions with frequent misting of rainwater.  Direct sun must be avoided.  Best performance is achieved in situations where stable conditions prevail year round without sudden changes occurring in temperature, rain volume, soil moisture levels or sun exposure. Plants produce a crop of fruits that are labor-intensive to harvest (typically hand-picked).  

In semi-tropical or temperate climates, this plant should be grown indoors in a heated greenhouse or in a warm shady humid place (hot steamy bathrooms are excellent).  Plants will not flower or fruit when grown outdoors in semi-tropical or temperate conditions or indoors in pots.  When grown indoors as a foliage plant, place the pot on a big saucer of constantly moist pebbles.  Plants may be propagated by rhizome division.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Elettaria cardamomum, commonly known as cardamom, is a pungent, aromatic, herbaceous, evergreen perennial of the ginger family.  This plant is native to tropical areas of India, Burma and Sri Lanka.  It is commonly found growing in tropical monsoon forests in the Western Ghat Mountains in the Malabar region of SW India where rainfall typically reaches about 150 inches per year.  It has been cultivated in a variety of different tropical areas around the world, with naturalization occurring in Tanzania, Vietnam and Central America (Costa Rica, Guatemala).  

Cardamom is internationally traded in the form of whole fruits and to a lesser extent as seeds.  Cardamom seeds (whole or ground) are frequently used in Indian and Asian cuisines.  Fruits have been traded in India for at least 1000 years.  Although cardamom is used around the world, its main consumers outside of its native territories are Middle Eastern countries (flavoring added to tea and coffee) and Scandinavia countries (flavoring added to baked goods).    German coffee planter Oscar Majus Kloeffer introduced cardamom to cultivation in Guatemala in the early 1900s.  India was the world’s largest producer of cardamom from ancient times until about 1980 when Guatemala surpassed India as the largest producer and exporter.

Outdoors in tropical climates, cardamom typically grows on somewhat cane-like stems to 6-15’ tall and features (1) fleshy knobby rhizomes; (2) leafy shoots bearing linear-lanceolate sword-shaped leaves (to 24” long); (3) leafless flowering stems which, depending on variety, are either horizontal, upright or in between;  (4) loose panicles to 1-2’ long of spring flowers featuring white or yellowish petals with lilac-purple veins and pink or yellow margins; (5) oblong, thin-walled, smooth-skinned, yellowish green fruit pods (to 3/4” long), each containing 15-20 aromatic black to reddish-brown seeds.   

Indoors in temperate climates, cardamom typically grows as a much smaller plant to 2-4’ tall without producing flowers or seed.  

Cardamom has a variety of uses today including:  (a) food flavoring (e.g., rice, meat, vegetables, coffee, tea, liquors, ice cream and baked goods); (b) medicinal uses (many of which are historical with limited validation by recognized medical researchers) to treat a large number of disorders including stomach/urinary tract problems, asthma, bronchitis, heart problems, indigestion, nausea, sore throats, depression, skin conditions, and bad breath); (c)  cosmetics; (d) perfumery; (d) breath freshener; (e) flavors a popular chewing gum in Mexico and Guatemala; (f) principal ingredient in curry powder.

Cardamom is the third most expensive spice by weight behind saffron and vanilla.Genus name comes from elettari which is the vernacular name for this plant in Malabar, India.Specific epithet is a Latinization of the Greek word kardamomom which describes an Indian spice.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems.

Garden Uses
Spice for tropical areas.  Otherwise primarily grown ornamentally (fragrant and attractive leaves) in homes or greenhouses where flowers/fruits are unlikely to appear.

Culture
Easily grown as a submerged aquatic, either anchored or free-floating, in water gardens in full sun. Thrives in cool water. Set plants out in pots or containers at the bottom of the water body or float plant cuttings/fragments in the water. Plant roots may be anchored in the muddy bottoms of small ponds. Remove or clip stems as needed to control population. Plants often remain green in winter and will overwinter under a cover of ice. Plants spread rapidly and can take over larger bodies of water, but are relatively easy to control in small water gardens.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elodea canadensis, commonly called Canadian pondweed, is a submerged aquatic perennial that has become a popular plant for water gardens and cool water aquariums. By absorbing nutrients, it helps control algae and keep waters clear. It produces fragile, branching, tangled stems to 3.5’ long (10-12’ in the wild) densely clad with short, drooping, lance-shaped to ovate dark green leaves (to 5/8” long) in whorls of three. Tiny, apetalous greenish-white flowers appear from July to September. Plants are dioecious with male and female flowers appearing on separate plants. Male flowers are rare, so propagation more often takes place by stem fragmentation than sexually. When pollination does occur, it is waterborne (pollen drifts from male to female flowers). Plants also produce buds (turions) which sink to the bottom in fall, overwinter as dormant buds and produce new plants in spring. Colonies in the wild provide excellent cover for fish, small crustaceans, insect larvae and snails. Native to North America, but widely naturalized in Europe. Synonymous with and formerly known as Anacharis canadensis. Also commonly called waterweed or anacharis. This plant is sometimes sold in small bunches for large aquariums where it provides interesting foliage and serves as both an oxygenator and water clarifier, although its close relative, Egeria densa (Brazilian waterweed marketed under the name of anacharis), is more commonly sold for this purpose.Genus name comes from the Greek word helodes meaning marshy or bred in marshes.Specific epithet means of Canada.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Water gardens. Not recommended for large ponds where population control can be more difficult. Large aquariums.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elymus canadensis, commonly called Canada wild rye, is a cool season, clump-forming, Missouri native ornamental bunch grass noted for its arching, wheat/rye-like spikes which bloom in summer and remain attractive well into winter. In Missouri, it typically occurs in open woods, prairies, fields, stream banks and waste areas throughout most of the State. Clumps typically grow 3-5' tall and feature flat, pointed, bluish-green to green leaves (to 3/4"" wide) which clasp the stems at the bases. Greenish flowers appear in terminal, arching, bristly spikes (to 6"" long) which, when mature, gracefully nod and sway in the wind on stiff stems rising well above the foliage. Foliage and spikes turn tan in fall, but continue to provide visual interest throughout much of the winter. Sometimes commonly called nodding wild rye.Genus name comes from the Greek word elymos used for a type of grain.Specific epithet means of Canada.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best naturalized in prairie, wild or native plant areas. Foliage and flower/seed spikes lend interest to borders, but self-seeding tendencies in borders is a concern. Good ground cover for dry, sunny slopes.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Adapts to wide range of soil conditions including heavy clay. Easily grown from seed and will readily self seed in the garden under optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elymus hystrix, commonly called bottle brush grass, is a Missouri native perennial grass which occurs in dry woodland areas throughout the State. Forms loose upright tufts of narrow-bladed, rough-textured, medium green leaves (to 12"" long). Greenish, bristly flower heads (9-10"" long) rise well above the foliage in summer, maturing to brown in late summer and persisting on the plant well into autumn. Flower heads resemble bottle brushes and are the best ornamental feature of this grass, particularly when backlit.Genus name comes from the Greek word elymos used for a type of grain.Specific epithet means hedgehog (porcupine) in reference to the supposed resemblance of the seed head bristles to the hedgehog quills.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Best grown in moist, relatively fertile, somewhat gritty, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Tolerates a wide variety of soils as long as they are sharply drained.  Performs poorly in climates with high humidity and high nighttime temperatures.  Good drought tolerance.  Evergreen only in mild winter locations.  Foliage may be cut back hard in cold winter locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elymus magellanicus, commonly called Magellan wheatgrass or blue wheatgrass, is a cool season perennial grass that is native to alpine areas in southern Patagonia (far southern parts of Chile and Argentina).  It is grown in landscapes today for enjoyment of its exceptional metallic blue leaves which many consider to have the best blue color of all blue-leaved grasses.  Flat, narrow, linear, pointed leaf blades grow in a dense foliage clump to 16” tall.  As they age, the older leaves arch outward revealing the central, more erect, intensely blue new growth.  Thin, stiff, upright blue flowering stems topped by wheat-like pale blue-green flower spikes rise above the leaves in late spring to early summer to 24-30” tall.  Flowers are light blue-gray, but turn tan with age.  Although the flower stems gracefully sway in the breeze, they are not particularly ornamental.  When mature, the blue flowers turn tan with the flower spikes purportedly resembling the fruit spikes of wheat, hence the common name of blue wheatgrass.Genus name comes from the Greek word elymos used for a type of grain.Specific epithet means of the region of the Straits of Magellan which is the South American water route separating southern Chile and Tierra del Fuego.‘Blue Tango’ is a cultivar that purportedly features more intense blue foliage color than that found on the species.  It is sometimes sold in commerce under the name of Agropyron magellanicum 'Blue Tango'.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Powdery mildew and rust are occasional problems in some areas.

Culture
Best grown in moist, relatively fertile, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade.  Perhaps best in light shade.  Tolerates a wide variety of soils.  Easily grown by seed.  This grass is considered to be a superb plant for erosion control (e.g., stabilizing wooded hillsides and streambanks).   Reproduces by tillering and seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elymus virginicus, commonly called Virginia wild rye, is a cool season perennial bunch grass which typically grows in a clump to 2-4’ tall.  It is native to a variety of habitats including bottomland forests, upland prairies, glades, stream banks, pastures, fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas (see Steyermark) across southern Canada from Newfoundland to British Columbia and in the eastern and central U.S. from Maine to Florida west to North Dakota, Wyoming, Kansas and Arizona.  It is commonly found throughout the State of Missouri.

Flat, linear, pointed leaf blades (to 3/8” wide) appear in tufts rising to 12” tall.  Non-showy greenish flowers bloom in June on stiff, terminal, arching, bristly, wheat/rye-like flower spikes (to 6” long) located atop flowering stems (culms) rising above the foliage to 4’ tall.  After bloom, the mature flowering spikes with developing seeds continue to provide ornamental interest as they gracefully nod and sway in the wind throughout summer and early autumn.  Foliage and seed spikes turn tan in fall.Genus name comes from the Greek word elymos used for a type of grain.Specific epithet means of Virginia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best naturalized in prairie, wild or native plant areas.  Erosion control for hillsides, slopes and streambanks.  Foliage and flower/seed spikes lend interest to borders, but self-seeding tendencies in borders is a concern.  Rain Gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade. Prefers rich, humusy soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Enemion biternatum, commonly called false rue anemone, is a tuberous-rooted, native Missouri wildflower which typically grows 5-8"" tall and occurs on open wooded slopes, river flood plains, rich woods and thickets. It is often seen growing in large colonies. Features white, anemone-like flowers (1/2"" diameter) with 5 petal-like sepals and showy yellow center stamens. Flowers appear in early spring atop slender stems mostly arising from the leaf axils. Commonly called false rue anemone because the flower is almost indistinguishable from the native Missouri rue anemone, Thalictrum thalictroides. Compound, basal leaves are divided into 3-lobed leaflets, usually 2 times ternately divided. Deeper leaflet lobes help distinguish this plant from Thalictrum.Specific epithet of biternatum is Latin for twice ternate.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best for woodland, wildflower or native plant gardens. May be used in shaded areas of the rock garden for early spring bloom.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained, acidic soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in part shade.  Prefers moist, organically rich, peaty soils with a pH below 6.  Blooms on previous year’s growth, so any pruning should be done immediately after flowering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Enkianthus campanulatus, commonly called redvein enkianthus, is an upright, deciduous shrub which typically grows 6-8’ tall (less frequently to 10-15’).  It is native to open woodlands in Japan.  Tiny, bell-shaped, nodding, creamy-yellow to whitish-pink flowers (each to 1/ 2” long) with pink striping and edging appear in pendulous clusters (racemes) in late spring (May-June).  Individual flowers resemble those of Pieris which is in the same family.  Elliptic, serrate, medium green to bluish green leaves (to 3” long) are crowded near the branch ends.  Fall color is variable, but at its best features quality red foliage with tones of orange, yellow and purple.Genus name comes from the Greek words enkyos meaning pregnant and anthos meaning flower in reference to the pregnant-looking flowers (prominent swelling at the base of each flower) found on some (e.g., E. quinqueflora) but not all species in the genus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word campanulatus  meaning bell-shaped in reference to the shape of the flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Since fall color is variable with this species, gardeners may wish to purchase plants in autumn when fall color is on display. Watch for spider mites in hot summer climates.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen, group or mass in the landscape.  Effective when grown with rhododendrons which share the same acidic soil requirements.  Shrub borders, foundations.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, plants may be grown outdoors during the growing season (either directly in the ground or in containers), but must be brought indoors for overwintering or they will not survive. Plants are best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Plants tolerate and often appreciate some part shade or light filtered sun in the heat of the day. Plants need consistently moist soils that do not dry out. Fertilize plants regularly during growing season. Site plants in areas protected from strong winds which can severely damage the large leaves. For containers, use a well-drained potting soil mix. Keep container soils consistently moist but not wet. In St. Louis, outdoor plants must be overwintered indoors, either in a sunroom/greenhouse or by forcing plants into dormancy. Options for overwintering include: (1) Bring container plant indoors in fall before first frost and place container in a large sunny room for overwintering as a houseplant, with reduced water and fertilization; (2) If container plant is too large to bring inside as a houseplant, cut foliage back to 6-8” in fall after first frost, and store container in a cool, dark, frost-free corner of the basement until spring, with periodic addition of a touch of moisture as needed in winter to prevent the soils from totally drying out; (3) If container plant is too heavy or too large to bring inside, remove plant from container in fall before first frost, wrap roots in plastic and store in a cool, dark, frost-free corner of the basement until spring (foliage may be trimmed back or left on the plant and allowed to brown up in the normal course); (4) If growing plants directly in the ground, dig, wrap roots, trim back the leaves and store as in option #3 above. After flowering and fruiting, the pseudostem dies. Propagate by seed or tissue culture.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ensete ventricosum, commonly called Abyssinian banana or wild banana, is a huge, banana-like, evergreen perennial that is very similar to plants in the genus Musa where it once resided as Musa ensete. As distinguished from Musa, this plant has a stronger leaf midrib and generally does not produce suckers. It is a fast-growing, evergreen perennial that typically grows to 12-20’ tall, but may reach 30-40’ tall in its native tropical habitat. Huge paddle-shaped leaves (to 10-20’+ long and 2-4’ wide) are bright olive green with prominent midribs. Sheathing leafstalks form a trunk-like structure. White flowers (generally non-showy) in inflorescences appear somewhat hidden in summer on mature plants. Younger plants often will not flower and fruit for the first 3-5 years. Container plants cut close to the ground in fall each year may never flower. Banana-like fruits (to 3” long) are dry and inedible. Gardeners in St. Louis primarily grow these plants not for their fruit but for their ornamental foliage that lends an exotic and tropical aura to the home and/or landscape.Genus name is from the Amharic name anset.Specific epithet means having a swelling one one side or pot-bellied.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids, spider mites, mealybugs and scale. Susceptible to anthracnose, wilt and mosiac virus.
","
Garden Uses
This plant needs lots of space and lots of attention. It also needs a protected site. It is a classic tropical foliage plant that becomes a striking specimen in the landscape.

Culture
Easily grown in average, consistently moist to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Prefers calcareous (lime rich), consistently damp, moisture retentive, nutrient-poor soils, including ones seasonally inundated.  Soils should not be allowed to dry out.  Plants spread by rhizomes and self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Epipactis palustris, commonly called marsh orchid or marsh helleborine, is a fleshy-rooted ground orchid with long horizontally-creeping rhizomes.  It is a plant typically found growing in neutral to highly calcareous soils, particularly favoring seasonally inundated marshy areas where competition from other vegetation is reduced.  Plants will spread to form dense colonies over time.  Habitats include fens, damp pastures, seeps, meadows, dune slacks, and abandoned gravel pits.  Winter hardy to USDA Zone 7 (Zone 6 with protection).  This orchid is native to central to northern Europe (generally absent from the Mediterranean region), the Caucasus, Turkey, northern Iran and central Asia.  Included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species under the category of Least Concern.  

Five or six sharply-pointed oblong-ovate to oblong-lanceolate leaves (each to 4-5” long) sheath the stem base, with narrower ovate to narrow-lanceolate leaves on an upright flower stem which rises well above the leaf base to 12-24” tall.  Flowers are brownish-purple (inner) and creamy-green (outer).  The base of the flower lips is marked with dark purple-to-red veins. Flower inflorescence has 4-15 (infrequently 20) flowers in a one-sided raceme.  Flowers bloom late June to August.  Fruit is a nodding capsule containing very tiny seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek epipaktis which is the Greek name for the plant or from the Greek word epipegnuo meaning coagulating milk.Specific epithet means marsh-loving.

Culture
In the tropics, flame violet can be grown as a ground cover or used as bedding plants. In temperate regions, they need greenhouse culture and are often grown as hanging baskets. Episcia cupreata need plenty of light but cannot tolerate the strong rays of the sun. Water with moderation in the summer and sparingly in winter. Let the soil dry in between waterings. Flame violets need high humidity but cannot tolerate water on their leaves. Fertilize every 2 weeks in summer with a balanced fertilizer diluted to ¼ strength recommended on the label. The best time to repot is in March using a well-drained, high-organic matter media with small gravel added to increase drainage. In cooler climates, this is a difficult plant to over-winter in lower light conditions, but cuttings can be easily taken in late summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Episcia cupreata has oval, wrinkled, green leaves flecked with copper and purple underneath with orange-red flowers with yellows in the axils; the lobes may be fringed. Flame violet has a definite creeping habit.Genus name comes from the Greek word episkios meaning shaded for the natural habitat of these plants.Specific epithet means coppery or copper-colored.
","
Problems
Problems include: fungal leafspots, stem blights and root rots, aphids, mealybugs; leaf margins turn brown from low humidity and too dry conditions; leaves scorch in full direct sun; die back occurs if too much water or too little air circulation. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In its native area, it is an evergreen, creeping perennial. In cooler climates, its trailing form makes them excellent for hanging baskets.

Culture
Best grown in medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates an extremely wide range of soils, however. Will grow in up to 4” of standing water. Spreads to form large colonies in the wild. Homeowners are often more interested in learning how to eradicate this plant from the landscape than how to grow it. It is a very aggressive plant which, if not preemptively restrained, will spread aggressively by branched, creeping rhizomes. Once established, it can be extremely difficult to remove by digging because its rhizomes spread wide and deep, and any small section of rhizome left behind can sprout a new plant. Consider using soil barriers to restrict growth. In water gardens or tub gardens, plant in pots at water bottom to contain growth (both height and spread).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Equisetum hyemale, commonly called scouring rush or rough horsetail, is a non-flowering, rush-like, rhizomatous, evergreen perennial which typically grows 3-5’ tall and is native to large portions of Eurasia, Canada and the U.S., including Missouri. It typically occurs in wet woods, moist hillsides and peripheries of water bodies (lakes, rivers, ponds). This species features rigid, rough, hollow, vertically-ridged, jointed-and-segmented, bamboo-like, dark green stems (to 1/2” diameter at the base) which rise up from the plant rhizomes. Each stem node (joint) is effectively marked by a whorl of tiny, stem-clasping, scale-like leaves which are fused into an ash-gray sheath (1/4” long) ending in a fringe of teeth. Teeth are usually shed during the growing season. Each sheath is set off and accentuated, both above and below, by thin, stem-ringing, black bands. Photosynthesis is basically carried on by the stems of this plant. Vegetative and fertile stems are alike in this species, with some vegetative stems bearing, at the stem tips, pine cone-like fruiting heads (to 1” long) which contain numerous spores. The evergreen stems are particularly noticeable in winter and can provide significant interest to the landscape. Stems have a high silica content and were used by early Americans for polishing pots and pans, hence the common name of scouring rush. Equisetum is not a rush however. Nor is it a fern. Equisetum is the single surviving genus of a class of primitive vascular plants that dates back to the mid-Devonian period (350 + million years ago). Today, the equisetums are categorized as fern allies in large part because they, like the ferns, are non-flowering, seedless plants which reproduce by spores.Genus name comes from the Latin words equus meaning a horse and seta meaning a bristle.Specific epithet means of winter or flowering is winter. Most probably for its winter interest as Equisetum is not a flowering plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Very aggressive spreader.
","
Garden Uses
Water gardens. Japanese gardens. Bog gardens. Stream or pond peripheries. Good plant for covering a wet low spot where nothing else will grow. Interesting plant for large patio containers. Provides strong vertical accent to any planting.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants do particularly well in sandy soils. Established plants have some drought tolerance. Cut back foliage to the ground in late winter to early spring. Plants will self-seed in optimum growing conditions. Propagate by division in early spring. Plants may not be winter hardy throughout the St. Louis area, and may be best sited in protected locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eragrostis elliottii, commonly known as love grass, is native to certain open woodlands, sandy areas and prairies in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. It is a fine-textured, warm season grass that grows to 3’ tall and is noted for its blue-green foliage and fluffy white flowers. White flower panicles appear in summer, turn tan by late summer as the seed ripens and finally lighten to straw hues in autumn. Flower panicles dance in the wind, hence the cultivar name. Additional common names for this species of grass include field love grass, blue love grass and Elliott’s love grass.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet presumably honors botanist Stephen Elliott (1771-1830) from Charleston, South Carolina.‘Wind Dancer’ features narrow (1/4” wide) blue-green leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Mature clumps sometimes tend to sprawl or droop.
","
Garden Uses
Good specimen accent. Group or mass in native plant areas or meadows where it can naturalize. Also effective when grown in large containers.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants generally perform best in sandy or gravelly loams in hot, dry locations. Plants tolerate infertile, poor soils. Good resistance to drought. Plants spread by self-seeding and by stems rooting along the ground at the nodes. Propagate by seed or division in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eragrostis spectabilis, commonly called purple love grass, is a warm season bunchgrass that is native to sandy soils from Maine to South Dakota south to Florida, Texas, Arizona and Mexico. In Missouri, it is found throughout the State, most commonly in sandy, rocky or open ground and along roads, fencerows and railroads (Steyermark). Flat, coarse, mostly basal, green leaves (to 10"" long and 3/8"" wide) form a somewhat disorganized clump of foliage that typically rises to 10"" tall. Soft reddish-purple flowers in a loose, open inflorescence appear in August, forming an airy cloud that covers the grass clump and raises the overall height of the plant to 24"" tall. Flowers lose color and turn brown by October. As the seeds mature, the inflorescence usually detaches from the plant and blows along the ground like a tumbleweed distributing seed as it goes.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet means spectacular or showy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eragrostis trichodes, commonly called sand love grass, is a warm season bunchgrass that is native from Ohio to Nebraska and south to Louisiana and Texas. It is densely tufted and typically rises to 2-4’ tall on generally weak stems. In Missouri, it is most commonly found in open sandy woods or in sandy areas along streams or railroad tracks (Steyermark). It features narrow, mostly flat, shiny dark green blades (to 6-30” long by 1/4” wide). Purple tinted flowers appear in loose, open panicles in July-August. Flower stems do not rise well above the foliage which detracts from the overall plant appearance. Mature plants turn bronze in fall and have continued interest into winter.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet means hairy or shaggy.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eranthemum pulchellum, commonly called blue sage, is a tropical evergreen shrub that grows in an upright-open form to 2-5' tall.  It is native to India and China.  It is noted for its axillary and terminal spikes (3-6"" long) of gentian blue flowers (each 3/4"" diameter).  Where winter hardy, blooms of this shrub usually appear most profusely in late winter to early spring, but continue throughout most of the year.  Each flower spike is subtended by showy green and white veined floral bracts which remain after the flowers drop.   Ovate to elliptic medium green leaves (to 4-8"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek word eranthemon an old name transferred to this genus.Specific epithet means pretty.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in locations that enjoy full sun at the time of bloom, but acquire increasing shade as overhead trees leaf out. Needs consistent moisture year-round (albeit less in summer and fall) even though plants go dormant by late spring. Plant tubers 2-3"" deep and 3"" apart in late summer to early fall. Soak tubers overnight before planting. May self-seed and naturalize over time in optimum growing conditions. Best left undisturbed once planted.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eranthus hyemalis, commonly called winter aconite, is native to Europe (France to Bulgaria).  It is a late winter bloomer (before crocus) that features cup-shaped, upward-facing, bright yellow, butter-cup like flowers on stalks to 3-4” tall.  Each flower is subtended by a collar of leaf-like bracts.  A true harbinger of spring, these rugged plants often send their shoots up through snow.  Lobed, basal, green leaves emerge after the flowers.Genus name comes from the Greek words er meaning spring and anthos meaning a flower for its very early flowering.Specific epithet means of winter or winter blooming.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Border fronts, rock gardens, along paths or walkways, or containers. Mass under trees or in front of shrubs. Naturalize in open woodland or wildflower areas. Good near kitchen window or garage where flowers can be appreciated in late winter.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Chrysothamnus nauseosus, commonly called rubber rabbitbrush, is a gray-green, narrow-leaved, multi-branched, vigorous-but-not-invasive, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 4-7’ tall and features an abundant bloom of yellow flowers from July to October.  It is native from Saskatchewan to British Columbia south through the Great Plains and western states to Texas, Sonora and Baja California where it is typically found growing in sunny open areas with dry soils (sandy, gravelly or clay) in a variety of habitats including the western plains, high desert, intermountain valley bottoms, foothills and mountains. It thrives in disturbed soils.  It is often seen growing with sagebrush.  Twigs are densely leafy, often strongly ill-scented, and are covered with persistent, felt-like, white to gray hairs.  Leaves (each to 2 3/4” long) are narrow-linear to linear-oblanceolate, nearly glabrous to tomentose, and often ill-scented when bruised.  Composite, tubular, yellow flowers (no rays) in dense rounded cymose clusters bloom abundantly from late July to October.  Fruit is an achene.   

Many experts have moved this species from the genus Chrysothamnus to the genus Ericameria because of several factors including the arrangement of the phyllaries, the white hairs covering young twigs and recent genetic testing.Genus name comes from the Greek words chrysos meaning gold and thamnos meaning shrub in reference to the showy blooms.Specific epithet is in reference to the nauseous aroma which usually emanates from bruised plant leaves.Common name is in reference to (a) shrubs in the wild are a haven for jackrabbits and (b) shrubs have latex in the sap, but not in quantities sufficient to make commercial production of rubber cost effective.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Not recommended for prominent garden areas.  Best grown in groups or massed in areas where colonial spread is not a concern.  The ornamental interests of this species include ability to thrive in poor soils, attractive gray-green leaves on white to green stems, and long and abundant bloom of yellow flowers.  May be sited in dry soils in difficult areas.  Xeriscaping.  Low hedge.  Erosion control.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Good drainage is important for this plant. Tolerates some light shade, particularly in hot summer climates. Plants may freely self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erigeron philadelphicus is an aster-like biennial or short-lived perennial that is native throughout the U.S. and much of Canada. In Missouri, it is typically found in fields, open woods, moist banks, meadows, valleys, waste ground and along roads and railroad tracks (Steyermark). Although noted for being somewhat weedy, this fleabane produces a profuse and showy mid-spring to early summer bloom of daisy-like flowers that are attractive in the landscape. Each flowerhead (to 1"" diameter) has 100-150 thread-like densely-packed pale pink to white rays with side by side bracts (not overlapping) and a yellow center disk. Plants typically grow to as much as 30"" tall on a single downy stem that branches in the upper half. Spatula-shaped basal leaves and lower stem leaves (2-6"" long) are stalked, toothed and often lobed. Leaves become smaller and fewer in number going up the stem, with the upper stem leaves being stalkless, untoothed and clasping. This fleabane is similar in appearance to asters except asters usually bloom later in the season with have bracts that overlap like shingles. Tea brewed from this species has been used in the past as a diuretic and an astringent.Genus name comes from the Greek words eri meaning early and geron meaning old man in reference to the early bloom time and downy plant appearance suggestive of the white beard of an old man.Specific epithet means of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.The fleabane name reportedly comes from a once widely held theory that this plant repels fleas.
","
Problems
Some susceptibility to powdery mildew, leaf spots and rust. Erigeron does not always thrive in hot and humid summer climates such as found in the St. Louis area.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, butterfly gardens, native plant/wildflower gardens, meadows or naturalized areas. May be used in borders and rock gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade, particularly in hot summer climates.  Also tolerates heat and humidity.  Good drainage is very important.  Plants will naturalize in optimum growing conditions by self-seeding and stoloniferous spread.  Propagate by seed, division or cuttings.  Best in poor to modest soils which have not been fertilized.  Plants usually perform poorly in rich soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erigeron pulchellus, commonly known as robin’s plantain, is an aster-like, stoloniferous, biennial to short-lived perennial that typically grows to 2’ tall on soft, hairy, hollow, unbranched, sparsely-leaved flowering stems rising from a basal clump of paddle-shaped, scalloped to bluntly toothed, soft and hairy leaves (2-6” long).  Stem leaves are shorter, stem-clasping, ovate to lanceolate and sparse.  This plant is native to rocky or open woods, thickets, fields, moist streambanks, disturbed areas and roadsides from Minnesota to Ontario, Quebec and Maine south to Florida, Louisiana and Texas.  In Missouri, it is commonly found in the eastern half of the State plus the Ozark region, but is absent from the northwestern part of the State.  Stems are topped in April to June with a profuse and showy bloom of small flowers (to 1 1/2” wide) in loose clusters (2-6 flowers per cluster).  Each flowerhead has 50-100 densely packed, thread-like, white to pale violet ray florets surrounding a yellow center disk.  Flowers resemble asters but have rays that are much narrower and more numerous.Genus name comes from the Greek words eri meaning early and geron meaning old man in reference to the early bloom time and downy plant appearance suggestive of the white beard of an old man.Specific epithet from Latin means beautiful.Plants in the genus Erigeron are often commonly called fleabane as a result of a once widely held theory that these plants repel fleas.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is best grown in fertile, evenly moist, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Best with consistent moisture, but established plants will tolerate some drought. Plants may survive temperatures to as low as 10-15 degrees F., but flowers and fruits will normally perish if temperatures dip below 28 degrees F. In St. Louis, plants may be grown in containers as houseplants. Containers may be taken outside in summer. Indoors, containers are best sited in sunny windows with moderate temperatures of 50-70 degrees F. Reduce watering in winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eriobotrya japonica, commonly called loquat, Japanese medlar or Japanese plum, is a small, short-trunked, upward-branching, broadleaf evergreen tree that typically grows to 10-25' tall with a round form. It also often grows as a large spreading shrub. It is generally noted for its compact size, attractive foliage, fragrant flowers and edible fruit. Loquat is native to China and perhaps Japan. Wrinkled, strongly-veined, leathery, elliptic-lanceolate leaves (to 12"" long) with toothed margins are dark green above and light green covered with rusty down beneath. Sweetly fragrant, five-petaled, white flowers in large panicles (to 6"" long) bloom in late fall-early winter. Flowers are followed by small spherical to pear-shaped fruits (to 1-2"" long), each with juicy flesh and one to several large seeds. Fruits typically ripen in spring (February in Florida and April in California). Fruits have smooth to downy, yellow to orange skin. Fruits are excellent when eaten fresh off the tree or in salads, sauces, jellies/jams or tarts/pies. Many different fruiting cultivars exist in commerce.Genus name comes from the Greek words erion meaning wool and botrys meaning a cluster of grapes for the woolly, clustered panicles.Specific epithet means of Japan.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. This rose family member is susceptible to fire blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, scale, fruit flies and caterpillars. Potential disease pests include rots, cankers, scab, leaf spot and blight. Seeds and young plant leaves are mildly poisonous if ingested. In areas where fruit set occurs, fruit drop can cause troublesome litter problems.
","
Garden Uses
In frost free areas, plants are grown commercially for fruit production or as landscape ornamentals near decks or patios. Good street tree in areas where fruit does not set. Effective houseplants in colder climates.

Culture
Grow in lean, gritty, lime-free, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Sharp soil drainage is important. Wet soils in winter can be fatal. Plants have good tolerance for drought, poor soils, rocky soils and high heat. Plants may be grown from seed and may self-seed in the garden. Notwithstanding its natural habitat in western alpine areas, this species adapts to eastern U.S. gardens at lower altitudes better than most of the eriogonums. Basal foliage is evergreen to semi-evergreen.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eriogonum umbellatum, commonly called sulphur flower, is a highly variable wildflower that is native to dry rocky soils in rocky forests, foothills, mountain slopes and mountain ridges from British Columbia and Alberta south to southern California, Arizona and the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Flora of North America lists 41 different varieties of this plant. This is a spreading, mat-forming perennial that is noted for its tiny sulphur yellow flowers which bloom from late spring into summer in compound umbels (rounded flower clusters to 4"" wide) located atop leafless flowering stalks rising to 12"" tall. Each umbel is subtended by a whorl of leaf-like bracts. Flowering stalks rise well above low-growing basal mounds of leathery, spatula-shaped, gray-green leaves (each 1/2"" to 1.5"" long). Leaves appear both in a basal rosette below the primary flowering stalk and as whorls at the ends of short woody stems emanating from the woody plant base. Leaves acquire red tones in fall. Each bell-shaped flower (to 1/4"" long) has 6 petal-like lobes. Flowers emerge sulphur yellow to cream, but age to an orange-yellow. Flowers ultimately age to brown and are attractive in dried arrangements. Plants will spread over time to 1-3' wide. Flowers are attractive to a large number of butterflies and bees. Birds are attracted to any seed that develops. This plant is also commonly called sulphur buckwheat.Genus name comes from the Greek words erion meaning wool and gony meaning a knee for the ""wooly"" nodes.Specific epithet is in reference to the almost umbrella-like arrangement of the flowers.

Culture
Grow in medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Will grow in wet soils with shallow water, but will also prosper in garden loams given consistent moisture. Tall plants may sprawl, particularly if grown in overly fertile soils or in too much shade. May be grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eryngium aquaticum, commonly called eryngo, is a coarse, aquatic perennial that typically occurs in marshes and bogs from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Mississippi. It is mostly found along the coast. It is similar in general appearance to E. yuccifolium which grows in much drier soils of rocky woods, prairies and glades. It is believed that some cultivated material sold as E. aquaticum is actually E. yuccifolium. Eryngo (also sometimes called sea holly) grows to 4’ tall. It features basal leaves that are linear to oblong-lanceolate and entire to remotely toothed. The upper leaves are sometimes spiny toothed to laciniate. Tiny white flowers (sometimes with a purplish tinge) bloom in summer in tight, rounded, flower heads.Genus name comes from an ancient Greek name used by Theophrastus for a plant which grew in Greece (probably Eryngium campestre) or is a Greek reference to the prickly or spiny nature of plants in this genus.Specific epithet means growing near or in water.

Problems

Culture
Easily grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates poor soils. Tall plants may sprawl, particularly if grown in overly fertile soils or in anything less than full sun. Avoid overwatering. This is a taprooted plant that transplants poorly and is best left undisturbed once established. Plants will slowly spread in the garden over time.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eryngium planum, commonly called sea holly, is a coarse, clump-forming perennial that features a summer bloom of steel-blue, thistle-like flower heads on branched stems rising from a rosette of dark green basal leaves. Basal leaves (typically elliptic to oblong, cordate-based and deeply-toothed) form a rosette to 6"" tall and to 14"" wide. Stiff, branched, violet-blue stems (to 32” tall), bearing abundant, egg-shaped, thistle-like, violet-blue flower heads, rise from each basal rosette in summer. Each flower head is a spherical-cylindrical umbel that is packed with tiny, stemless, violet-blue flowers. Each flower head is subtended by a narrow, spiky collar of spiny, blue-green bracts. Summer bloom is often profuse.Genus name comes from an ancient Greek name used by Theophrastus for a plant which grew in Greece (probably Eryngium campestre) or is a Greek reference to the prickly or spiny nature of plants in this genus.Specific epithet means flat.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to root rot (needs dry soils). Watch for leaf spot diseases. Aphids, slugs and snails may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent selection for sun baked areas of the landscape. Beds and borders. Effective as a single specimen or in groupings. Excellent for cut or dried flower arrangements.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eryngium yuccifolium, commonly called rattlesnake-master or button snake-root, is a Missouri native plant which occurs in rocky woods, prairies and glades throughout the State and was a common plant of the tallgrass prairie. Most members of the parsley/carrot family (Apiaceae) have finely cut foliage and flowers in domed umbels. Not so with rattlesnake-master which features basal rosettes of parallel-veined, bristly-edged, sword-shaped, medium green leaves (to 3' long) resembling those of yucca (lily family) and tiny, stemless, greenish-white flowers tightly packed into globular, 1"" diameter heads resembling thistles (composite family). Flower heads appear in branched clusters at the top of smooth stiff stems typically rising to 3-4' (less frequently to 5-6') tall from the centers of the rosettes. Flower heads are subtended by whitish, pointed bracts.Genus name comes from an ancient Greek name used by Theophrastus for a plant which grew in Greece (probably Eryngium campestre) or is a Greek reference to the prickly or spiny nature of plants in this genus.Specific epithet is in reference to leaves that look like Yucca.Common name is in reference to a former use of this plant as a treatment for rattlesnake bite.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Taller plants may need support, however staking of these substantial plants in a cosmetically acceptable manner can be difficult. Massing plants in naturalized areas where they can provide some support to each other may be the best solution for this problem.
","
Garden Uses
Native plant gardens, naturalized areas or prairies. Also can be effective in borders.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erysimum capitatum, commonly called Western wallflower, is broadly distributed throughout western North America. It is also native to Missouri where it primarily occurs on rocky open ground, limestone glades and bluffs in the central part of the State (Steyermark). It is an erect biennial that features a dense, rounded flower cluster (raceme) of showy, 4-petaled orange to yellow-orange to maroon to nearly white flowers (3/4"" wide) atop a leafy upright stem growing 1-2' tall. Linear to narrow oblong leaves (to 3"" long) appear in a basal rosette and along the stem. Flowers give way to 4-angled seed pods (to 4"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek word eryomai meaning blistercress.Specific epithet is in reference to either the head-like shape of the flower cluster or the knobby stigma.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.   Best in full sun in cool northern climates, but appreciates some part shade in the heat of the day in hot southern climates.  This flower is a biennial, so self-seeding will be necessary for it to remain in the garden.  Sow seed in spring for bloom the following year.  Plants may bloom as annuals if seed is planted early enough in spring. Cut back spent flowering stems only after seed has been harvested or has ripened and fallen to the ground.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erysimum cheiri, commonly known as common wallflower, is a woody-based herbaceous perennial subshrub in the mustard family that is typically cultivated as a biennial.  It is noted for producing clusters (racemes) of fragrant 4-petaled flowers in a showy spring bloom followed by narrow pendant dehiscent seed pods (siliques).  It typically grows to 6-24” (occasionally to 30”) tall.  Flowers (each to 3/4” wide) are mostly bright yellow or yellow-orange to brown, but sometimes appear reddish purple to burgundy.  Bright green leaves (to 2-8” long by 3/4” wide) are narrow and pointed.  Common wallflower is native to southern Europe, but has been introduced in North America where it has naturalized in British Columbia, Washington and California.  Popular garden plant in Europe.  

This plant loves sharp soil drainage as exemplified by its ability to grow in little pockets of gritty soil on stone walls as suggested by its common name of wallflower.

Synonymous with and formerly known as Cheiranthus cheiri.Genus name comes from the Greek word eryomai meaning blistercress.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word cheir meaning hand in reference to an old custom dating back to the Middle Ages where wall flowers were carried in small bouquets by hand to festivals or other events.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Erythrina crista-galli, commonly called coral tree or cockspur coral tree, is a spiny South American tree with compound pinnate leaves and crimson flowers.  It typically grows as a small tree to 15-20' tall, but may occasionally reach 30' in optimum conditions.  It also sometimes grows as an upright shrub.  It is native to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina.  Trees often develop gnarled trunks with age.  Papilionate crimson flowers in loose terminal drooping racemes (to 2' long) bloom in early spring.  Up to two additional bloom periods may occur over the period of summer to early fall depending on growing environment.  Flowers are followed by seed pods (to 3-8"" long) which ripen to brown. Alternate, compound pinnate, dark green leaves, with each leaf having three broad-elliptic leaflets (each to 4-6"" long), are attractive throughout the growing season.  

In the U.S., this tree performs well in the Deep South (Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana), Texas, southern California and Hawaii.  It is the National Tree of Argentina, and its flower is the national flower of Argentina and Uruguay.   Coral tree is the official tree of the City of Los Angeles, California.Genus name comes from the Greek word erythros meaning red.

Culture
Best grown in moist, acidic, humusy soils in part shade to full shade. Plants may be grown from seed, but will not flower for 4-5 years. Quicker and better results are obtained from planting corms which are sold by many bulb suppliers and nurseries. In addition, offsets from mature plants may be harvested and planted. Plant corms 2-3” deep and 4-5” apart in fall. Corms of this species produce stolons, and plants will slowly spread to form large colonies if left undisturbed in optimum growing conditions. These native plants do not transplant well and should be left alone in the wild.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erythronium albidum, commonly called white dogtooth violet, is a Missouri native spring wildflower which occurs in moist woods, on wooded slopes and bluffs, and along streams throughout the State (Steyermark). It grows from tiny corms which purportedly resemble dogteeth and its flowers somewhat resemble violets, hence the common name. A single, nodding, bell- or lily-shaped white flower with yellow at the base blooms atop a naked scape sheathed by two basal, tongue-shaped, tulip-like leaves in early spring. Typically grows 6-12” tall. Flowering plants always have two basal leaves, however colonies frequently have non-flowering plants with only a single leaf. Leaves are mottled with silver-green (less frequently brown), hence giving rise to an additional common name of white trout lily. It should be noted that white trout lily is, from a botanical standpoint, a more accurate common name since this plant is a member of the lily family and not the violet family.Genus name comes from the Greek word erythronion from erythros meaning red, originally the name for another plant.Specific epithet means white.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. As with many of the early spring wildflowers, white dogtooth violet usually goes dormant by late spring.
","
Garden Uses
Naturalize in moist soils in shaded areas of native plant gardens, shade gardens, woodland gardens or wild/naturalized areas. Also grows well in pond or stream banks or in shady areas of rock gardens.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Erythronium americanum, commonly called yellow adder’s tongue, yellow trout lily, yellow fawn lily and yellow dog-tooth violet, is a Missouri native spring wildflower that occurs in moist woods, on wooded slopes and bluffs, and along streams in the southern part of the State (Steyermark). A single, nodding, bell- or lily-shaped yellow flower blooms atop a naked scape sheathed by two glossy, tongue-shaped, tulip-like, basal leaves (to 6” long) in early spring. Petal-like perianth segments are reflexed and often brushed with purple on the outside. Anthers are yellow to brown. Leaves are mottled with brown and purple. It typically grows 4-6” (infrequently to 9”) tall. Flowering plants always have two basal leaves, however colonies frequently have non-flowering plants with only a single leaf. The common name of adder’s tongue is in reference to the tongue-like shape of the flowering shoot as it rises up in spring and the supposed resemblance of the flower to the open mouth of a snake. The common name of trout lily is in reference to the mottled leaves and the appearance of the flowers during trout fishing season. The common name of fawn lily is in reference to the spotted leaves and the supposed resemblance of the two-leaved plant to the upright ears of a fawn. The common name of dog-tooth violet (it grows from tiny corms that purportedly resemble dogteeth and its flowers somewhat resemble violets) is unfortunately quite misleading because this flower is not a member of the violet family.Genus name comes from the Greek word erythronion from erythros meaning red, originally the name for another plant.Specific epithet means of North or South America.

Culture
Cool weather annual or short-lived perennial that is easily grown in sandy, poor to average, well-drained soils in full sun. Sharp soil drainage is essential. Sow seed directly in the garden at the last spring frost date or start plants in pots indoors 2-3 weeks prior to last spring frost date. Seed may be sown in fall in USDA Zones 6-10. Deadhead flowers regularly to promote additional bloom, but leave some flowerheads for self-seeding. Plants are more apt to perform as short-lived perennials in USDA Zones 8-10.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eschscholzia californica, commonly called California poppy, is the state flower of California. It is native to hillsides, roads and open areas from southern Washington south through California, Nevada and New Mexico to northern Mexico. Plants grow in loose, free-branching mounds to 12-15” tall and as wide, with finely divided, fern-like, blue-green leaves. Single, cup-shaped, 4-petaled, silky flowers (3” diameter) are typically bright orange or less frequently yellow-orange. Flowers bloom on long stems from late spring to early summer. Flowers close up in rainy or cloudy weather and at night. Flowers give way to dehiscent seed capsules which split open when ripe to release seeds. Plant foliage turns straw-brown after flowering. Cultivars are available in semi-double to double forms in additional colors including white, pink, red, lilac and purple.Genus name honors Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz (1793-1831) of Tartu (Dorpat), Estonia, who accompanied Otto von Kotzebue on his first expedition around the world (1815-1818).Specific epithet means of California.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where this plant is best grown in humus-rich, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Prefers consistently moist soils.  Mulch helps maintain good soil moisture.  Plants must be protected from strong winds which can snap off the leafstalks.  Plants are monocarpic (flower stems die after flowering with new stems developing at the base).  Plants are totally intolerant of frost.  They also will often perform poorly in frost-free climates when night temperatures dip below 50 degrees F.  These plants probably should not be grown indoors in cooler climates, however, because they will grow much shorter with less vitality and probably will not flower.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Etlingera elatior, commonly known as torch ginger, is a tropical rhizomatous perennial of the ginger family that grows to 12-15’ tall in tropical climates but much shorter in cooler climates.  It is native to Malayasia and Indonesia where it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.  Arching leafstalks to 15’ tall are clad with ribbed, leathery, banana-like leaves (to 3’ long), each having a central groove.  Naked flower stalks rise directly from the rhizomes to 3’ tall, each stalk being topped by a cone-shaped inflorescence containing tiny yellow flowers over tiny fertile bracts, both of which are somewhat hidden inside of and subtended by large, drooping, showy petal-like red bracts.  Flowers bloom throughout the year.  Each naked flower stalk with crowning terminal inflorescence purportedly resembles a torch, hence the common name of torch ginger for this plant.  

Stems are sometimes sliced into small pieces and added to curries and soups.Genus name honors Andreas Ernst Etlinger, 18th century botanist.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word elatus meaning tall.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-11 where plants are grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some drought. Because of its extremely rapid growth rate, it can be grown in gardens in the St. Louis area as an annual shrub from seed. Plants can be regularly pruned to stimulate bushy growth. Plants are also commonly grown in containers as either shrubs or trained as standards. Container plants can be placed on patios or sunk into the ground to the lip, but must be brought indoors in fall before first frost for overwintering. Container plants can be stooled (bushy plants are cut to the ground and standards are cut back to the trunk) prior to overwintering, in which case the stooled plants are best overwintered in a cool, dark basement or frost-free garage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eucalyptus cinerea, commonly called argyle apple or silver dollar tree is native to Australia. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree that will grow as a single trunk tree to 25-60’ tall in its native habitat. Bark is reddish-brown, peeling on smaller stems. If grown as an annual shrub from seed in the St. Louis area, it typically grows rapidly to 6-8’ tall by mid-summer. Juvenile foliage consists of opposite rounded silvery bluish-green leaves (to 2” long) resembling large coins, hence the common name of silver dollar tree. Foliage is aromatic. Small white flowers rarely appear on juvenile trees or container plants. Foliage stems are frequently used by florists in fresh flower arrangements.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.Specific epithet means ash-colored.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eucalyptus darylmpleana is native to tablelands and forest slopes in the mountains of southeastern Australia.  It is a columnar, fast-growing, broadleaf evergreen tree with a straight, creamy white trunk.  It typically matures to 70' tall and 25' wide with a trunk diameter to 4 1/2'.  In favorable growing conditions in its native habitat, it sometimes grows to as much as 180' tall with a trunk diameter to 6'.  Lower branches drop as the tree grows upward.  Light, ovate, dull bluish-green juvenile leaves (to 4"" long) are followed by narrow, lanceolate, curved, drooping, willowy, bright green adult leaves (to 8""  long).  Juvenile leaves are copper-tinged when young.  Foliage is aromatic.  Apetalous creamy white  flowers bloom in umbels of 3 (less frequently to 7) in summer.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.Specific epithet honors Richard Dalrymple-Hay (1861-1943), Commissioner of Forests in New South Wales.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eucalyptus deglupta, commonly called Mindanao gum or rainbow eucalyptus, is a very large, fast-growing, broadleaved evergreen tree that is native to moist humid tropical forested areas with high rainfall in New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippine Islands (Island of Mindanao).  It is the only eucalyptus tree that is indigenous to the northern hemisphere.  In its native habitat, it will mature to as much as 250' tall with a trunk diameter of 6'.  Outside its native habitat, it will typically grow much shorter (to 100-125' tall).  It is perhaps best noted for its smooth orange-tinted trunk bark which peels in summer to reveal a unique and sometimes stunning multi-colored bark (as described by the common name of rainbow eucalyptus) consisting of streaks of pale green, red, orange, gray and purple-brown.  Outside tropical settings, the bark is typically much less colorful.  Acuminate, lance-shaped leaves (to 6"" long) are aromatic when crushed.  Tiny white flowers in axillary or terminal compound inflorescences (panicles of 7-flowered umbels) bloom at various times during the year depending upon location.  Trees are a source of hardwood timber.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where plants are best grown in dry to medium moisture, average to moderately fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Avoid significant shade.   Tolerates nutritionally poor soils.  Established trees have wide tolerances for soil type (light sandy soils to heavier clay soils).  Do not fertilize.  Susceptible to damage from sudden cold spells.  Pruning techniques include coppicing and pollarding.  This eucalyptus can be grown as a houseplant in a sunny south-facing window (6-8 hours of sun per day, consistently moist soil from spring to fall, and annual winter pruning to keep plants compact and bushy).   Plants in containers are typically less drought tolerant than plants grown in the ground.  Good indoor growth in containers can be difficult to achieve because of this tree's rapid growth rate (even with pruning it may rapidly outgrow the pot). Containers can be placed on sunny patios or sunk in the ground to the lip from spring to fall, but must be brought indoors in fall prior to first frost for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eucalyptus perriniana is native to Australia.  It is commonly called spinning gum because the rounded, glaucous, stem-encircling, powdery-gray, juvenile leaves, after dying, will dry and spin in the wind around the stems.  Lanceolate adult leaves (to 8"" long and 1.5"" wide) are gray-green.  Leaves have a distinctive, sweet, mild menthol-like fragrance.  This is a fast-growing, evergreen tree that typically matures to 20-30' tall.  Apetalous, hermaphroditic, creamy white flowers bloom in clusters of three (umbels) in summer.  Bark shreds in ribbons to form a dull white to light gray surface accented by brown and green patches.  Stems with juvenile leaves are frequently used by florists in flower arrangements.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Coppice annually to control size and to insure good production of circular juvenile leaves if desired.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy,  it may be grown as an attractive ornamental tree in sunny landscape areas.  May also be pruned to shrub form.  Effective in sunny woodland margins.  May also be grown in containers as a houseplant.  May be grown from seed in St. Louis gardens in an annual shrubby form because of its rapid growth rate.

Culture
This is a tropical evergreen plant (USDA Zone 10 if attempted outdoors) that should be grown as a houseplant in pots in the St. Louis area. Pots may be taken outside in summer (June - August), but plants do not like temperatures below 55 degrees F. and should be returned indoors in early fall. Plant 4-5 bulbs per 6"" pot in a good well-drained potting soil mixture. Plant neck tips of bulbs at or slightly above the soil surface. Soils should be kept consistently moist during growth periods. Best in areas of high humidity and sun dappled or bright shade, but no direct sun. Best flowering occurs when roots are pot-bound. Bulbs do not like to be disturbed and should only be repotted when necessary (i.e., pot looks like it is ready to break). Normally blooms in winter, but can be induced into blooming 2-3 times per year by significantly reducing moisture after bloom to the point where the soils remain dryish for about one month. When new growth appears, resume normal watering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eucharis amazonica, commonly called Amazon lily, is a bulbous tropical plant of the Amaryllis family. Clusters (3-6 flowers each) of waxy, white, daffodil-like (triandrus) flowers bloom atop stems to 18-24"" tall. Flowers are fragrant. Glossy, oval to elliptic, long-petioled leaves are evergreen and rather attractive when flowers are not in bloom. Grown commercially for cut flowers.Genus name comes from the Greek word meaning pleasing or charming for the fragrant beauty of the flowers.Specific epithet means of the Amazon.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates close to full shade, but usually at the expense of diminished fall color quality. This is an adaptable shrub that tolerates a wide range of soils except for wet, poorly-drained ones. Plants appreciate consistent moisture, particularly when grown in full sun locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euonymus alatus, commonly called winged euonymus, burning bush, winged burning bush or winged spindle tree, is a dense, mounded, spreading, flat-topped, multi-stemmed shrub that is particularly noted for its fiery red fall foliage color. It is native to forests, woodlands and scrub areas in eastern Russia, Japan, China and Korea. It was introduced into the U.S. around 1860 as an ornamental, and over time has become an extremely popular shrub for homes, commercial properties and along highways. This shrub will mature over time to 15-20' tall, but is often pruned shorter. Elliptic to obovate, crenulate to serrulate, green leaves (to 3” long) turn bright red in fall. Fall color can be spectacular. Small, yellowish-green flowers appear in May but are not showy. Small fruits (1/3” red capsules) ripen in fall. Fruit capsules split open when ripe to reveal the tiny seeds (each encased in a fleshy orange-red aril). Seeds are attractive to certain birds who eat and distribute them. Greenish-brown stems have distinctive corky ridges (""wings"" as used in the common name). Corky-winged stems are more noticeable in winter after leaf drop. Winged euonymus has escaped plantings and naturalized in at least 21 eastern and mid-western states. In some areas, it is now considered to be a threat to native plants because of its ability to establish itself in woodlands, forests, fields, roadsides and disturbed areas where, if conditions are favorable, it will out-compete native plants to form dense thickets.Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet means winged.More compact forms (4-10' tall) are also available (e.g., Euonymus alatus 'Compactus' and Euonymus alatus 'Rudy Haag').
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Twig blight may occur, particularly in wet soil conditions. Watch for spider mites.
","
Garden Uses
This shrub produces excellent fall color. Specimen/accent, group or mass. Foundations, shrub borders, screen or hedge.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Euonymus americanus, commonly known as strawberry bush, is a multi-stemmed, suckering, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 4-6’ tall.  It is native to wooded slopes, moist understory forest areas, low sandy woods, ravines and streambanks from New York south to Florida and west through Pennsylvania to Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and eastern Texas.  Range in Missouri is limited to the far southeastern corner of the State including Crowleys Ridge and the Bootheel.  

This shrub is somewhat sprawling when young, but becomes more erect as it matures.  It features green stems, medium green leaves with fine marginal teeth, inconspicuous 5-petaled greenish-yellow flowers from the leaf axils in May-June and warty crimson red fall fruits purportedly resembling strawberries hence the common name of strawberry bush.  Thin spreading branches are clad with oblong to elliptic leaves (to 3” long) with crenulate margins, narrow to rounded bases and sharply pointed tips.  Each leaf has 5-7 pairs of ascending veins which disappear prior to reaching the margins.  Leaves turn dark orange-red in fall.  Spring flowers bloom from the leaf axils on pedicils to 1” long.  Each flower (1/3” across) has 5 pale green to greenish yellow petals with purple stamens.  Most flowers in the genus have 4 petals, but this species has 5.  Although the flowers are not showy, they are followed in fall by extremely showy, warty, crimson red fall fruits (to 3/4” diameter).  Each fruit is a 5-lobed capsule which splits open when ripe (hence the sometimes used common name of bursting heart)Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet means native to America.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for euonymus scale. Mites, leaf miner, aphids, mealybugs and crown gall are common.  Witches’ broom, stem dieback, powdery mildew and fungal leaf spots may appear.  Deer love to eat the foliage of this plant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Adaptable shrub which tolerates wide range of soils and full shade. Will not tolerate wet, poorly-drained soil, however.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euonymus atropurpureus, commonly called Eastern wahoo, is a deciduous, Missouri native shrub or small tree which is most often grown for its attractive red berries and fall color. Occurs in the wild in open woods and thickets, near streams and on wooded slopes throughout the State. Typically appears as an upright, spreading, deciduous shrub with an irregular crown growing to 10-15' (less frequently to 25') tall. Dark green elliptic to ovate leaves (to 5"" long) turn dull red to greenish red in fall. Small, purple flowers appear in the leaf axils in late spring but are not particularly showy. Scarlet red fruits (1/2"" capsules) appear in autumn. Fruit is attractive to wildlife and is often considered to be the best ornamental feature of the shrub. Although the bark, leaves and fruits of eastern wahoo were formerly used for a variety of medicinal purposes, all parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested. Also sometimes commonly called burning bush.Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet means dark purple in probable reference to the color of the fruits and fall foliage.
","
Problems
As with most euonymus, eastern wahoo is susceptible to scale.
","
Garden Uses

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euonymus europaeus, commonly called European spindletree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that is native from Europe to western Asia.  In the U. S., it has escaped cultivation and spread (sometimes invasively) by self-seeding, particularly in some areas of the Northeast.  This is a spindly tangled shrub-tree with an irregular crown.  Best ornamental features are its showy fall fruit and sometimes superb fall leaf color.  It grows, often rapidly, to 12-20' (less frequently to 30') tall.  Although slender in youth, it typically matures to a rounded form.  Small, yellowish-green flowers (1/2"" across)  bloom in 3-5 flowered cymes from late April to June.  Flowers are not very showy.  Flowers are followed by fruits which are extremely showy.  Pinkish-red dehiscent capsules split open in fall to reveal tiny seeds, each of which is encased in a fleshy orange aril.  Seeds are attractive to certain birds who eat and distribute them. Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, crenate-serrate, glabrous, dull dark green leaves (to 3"" long) turn variable shades of red to orange to purple in fall.  Spindletree wood was once used to make spindles.Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet means European.

Euonymus fortunei, commonly called wintercreeper euonymus, is a dense, woody-stemmed, broadleaf evergreen to semi-evergreen plant that comes in a variety of forms.  It may appear as a trailing ground cover, a mounding shrub or a climbing vine.Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet honors Scottish horticulturist and plant collector in China Robert Fortune (1812-1880).‘Canadale Gold’ features oval-rounded, medium green, evergreen leaves (to 1”) variegated with wide bright yellow leaf margins.  This is a compact, densely-branched, spreading, irregular to mounded, shrubby form which typically grows to 2-3' tall and to 3-4' wide.   Flowers are sparse, and sometimes do not appear.
","
Problems
Euonymus scale can be a significant problem and should be treated if it appears.  Anthracnose, crown gall, leaf spot, mildew and aphids can also be problems. Can spread invasively into lawns or adjacent garden areas or can climb adjacent structures.
","
Garden Uses
Where not deemed invasive it can be a versatile ground cover for sunny or shady areas in the landscape. Also effective as an edger along paths or sidewalks, as a slope cover where it can also provide erosion control, as a foundation planting. If used as an ivy-like climbing vine for covering walls, chimneys or fences, it more easily flowers and sets seeds that can increase its invasive spread.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Does well in both sandy and clay soils. Needs constant moisture.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eupatorium perfoliatum, commonly called boneset, is a large, hairy, clump-forming, Missouri native perennial which typically occurs in wet soils in low woods, thickets, stream banks, meadows and prairies throughout the State. Flat-topped clusters (compound corymbs) of small, fluffy, white flowers appear above the foliage in late summer to fall. Perfoliate foliage is quite distinctive: the bases of the pairs of wrinkled, opposite, lance-shaped, medium green leaves unite to surround the hairy stems (perfoliatum meaning through the foliage). Historically, boneset was commonly included in medical herb gardens and used as a folk medicine for treatment of flus, fevers, colds and a variety of other maladies. Though some authorities claim the name boneset refers to a former use of the plant to aid the healing process for broken bones, others claim that the name is in reference to the plant's use as a diaphoretic in the treatment of an 18th century influenza called break bone fever. All parts of the plant are quite toxic and bitter. Also commonly called thoroughwort.Genus name comes from the Greek name for these herbaceous and shrubby plants in honor of Mithridates VI Eupator, 132-63 B.C., King of Pontus, who reportedly discovered the medicinal uses for some Eupatorium species plants.Specific epithet means perfoliate, having leaf bases that encircle the node, so that the stem apparently passes through it.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage may scorch if soils are allowed to dry out.

Culture
Grow in dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in a Mediterranean-type climate, and may show stress in hot and humid summers. They must have sharply-drained soils. They dislike heavy clay. Plants generally have good drought tolerance, but appreciate some moisture in dry summer periods. Wet soils in winter can be fatal. Plants often decline after flowering. Cut flower stems off at the base after bloom to provide room for newly emerging stems. Plants are considered to be evergreen in warm winter areas. Plants are not reliably winter hardy in USDA Zone 6 (St. Louis) where, if attempted, they should be sited in protected locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia characias is an upright euphorbia that is native to Southern Europe, the Balkans and Turkey. It typically grows on erect, woody-based, green stems to 3-4' tall and to 3' wide. Narrow, linear to obovate, blue-green leaves (to 5"" long) are spirally arranged along the stems. Each stem is topped in spring by a thick, bottlebrush-like inflorescense of greenish-yellow flowers. Individual flowers lack petals, but have showy, petal-like, greenish-yellow bracts (cyathium in the genus Euphorbia is defined as a cup-like involucre). Broken stems exude a white milky sap that is a skin irritant and poisonous. 

Subsp. wulfenii differs from the species by growing shorter to only 2-3' tall and by having more yellow in the flowers, darker purple on the glands and larger leaves.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia cotinifolia, commonly called smoketree spurge, tropical smokebush or Caribbean copper plant, is a thin-leaved, sometimes deciduous, tropical shrub or small tree that is noted for its attractive burgundy-red foliage. It is native to Mexico. As a shrub, it typically grows to 10-15' tall. It may be trained as a tree with growth to as much as 30' tall. Container plants grown as annuals are much shorter. Purplish stems are clad with broad-elliptic to round leaves (to 4 1/2"" long). that emerge red but mature to dark burgundy. Small white flowers (individual flowers lack petals) in loose panicles bloom at the branch ends in summer. Flowers are subtended by white to creamy white bracts. Broken stems exude a white milky sap that is a skin irritant.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet comes from the genus Cotinus (smoketree) and folia (leaf) in reference to the cotinus-like leaves of this euphorbia.Common names of smoketree spurge and tropical smokebush are also reminiscent of the cotinus common names of smoketree and smokebush.

Culture
Best grown in dry, well-drained soils in full sun. Quite tolerant of poor soils, including rocky, sandy ones. Eight to ten plants per square yard are sufficient to quickly form a dense ground cover. Spreads by rhizomes and can be quite invasive, particularly in rich, moist soils. Also freely reseeds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia cyparissias, commonly called cypress spurge, is an erect, branching, rhizomatous perennial which typically grows to 12"" tall and can rapidly spread to form a bushy ground cover. Numerous tiny flowers appear in umbel-like clusters in spring. Flowers lack petals and sepals, and primarily consist of showy lime-yellow bracts which age to red. Narrow, bluish-green, linear leaves (to 1.5"" long). Stems and leaves contain a milky sap which is poisonous. Plant foliage superficially resembles that of a tiny spruce or cypress tree, hence the common name.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet refers to the cypress-like foliage.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Invasiveness can be a significant problem, particularly if plants are grown in close proximity to valuable garden perennials.

Promptly remove spent flowers (shearing plants to shape is one option) to prevent any unwanted self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia polychroma, commonoly called cushion spurge, is a mounding, clump-forming perennial which typically grows in a dome (or cushion) shape to 12-18"" tall and as wide on erect, sturdy stems bearing oblong, downy, medium green leaves (to 2"" long). Cymes of inconspicuous greenish flowers (lacking both sepals and petals) bloom at the stem ends in spring. Although the flower cymes are not showy, they are subtended by long-lasting, bright sulphur-yellow bracts which are exceptionally showy. Stems exude a toxic, milky sap when cut. Leaves turn red in fall. 

Synonymous with Euphorbia epithymoides.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet means many colors'Bonfire' was bred by Mary Ann Faria of Limerock Plant Farm from an two unnamed Euphorbia epithymoides plants. It was introduced by Blooms of Bressingham®. The leaves of ‘Bonfire’ emerge green in spring but the top growth quickly turns deep red, orange, and purple, with the color deepening to burgundy red in mid summer. The leaves turn a rich red in fall. Its flowers are insignificant but surrounded by colorful yellow to chartreuse bracts. ‘Bonfire’ has a compact mounding habit growing 1 to 1.5 ft. tall and 1.5 to 2 ft. wide. U.S. Plant Patent #18,585 issued on March 11, 2008.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where plants are best grown in well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Must have sharply-drained soils.  Allow soils to dry out after each watering, but water consistently in summer as needed to prevent soils from totally drying out.  Decrease watering in winter.  Plants are intolerant of frost.  Potted plants may be overwintered indoors.   May be grown as a houseplant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia lactea, commonly called mottled spurge, and also known as mottled candlestick or milkstripe euphorbia, is a usually leafless, cactus-like succulent shrub or small tree that grows in an upright columnar form to as much as 15' tall.  In containers, it grows much smaller and can be easily maintained as a 1-2' tall houseplant.  It is believed to be native to India.  It is noted for its shrubby habit, spiny stems, mottled branches (green with white lines), usually 4-angled stems, paired black stem thorns, and white milky sap.  All parts of this plant are poisonous, particularly the white sap (latex) which exudes from stem cuts.  Sap is also an often significant irritant to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Tiny ovate leaves appear at the growing tips in summer, but drop quickly leaving plants leafless most of the time.  Plants rarely flower in cultivation.  When flowers do appear, they are inconspicuously located in paired cyathia near the stem tips.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet means milk, probably for the plant's milky sap.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids, mealybugs and nematodes may appear.  Watch for mites.  Avoid contact with poisonous plant sap.

Culture
Annual that is easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants are tolerant of poor soils, including rocky-sandy ones. Plants appreciate some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates. However, clumps tend to open up and lose their attractive shape in too much shade. Must have sharply-drained soils. Grow plants in the garden from seed. Seed may be started indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Plants will remain in the garden from year to year by self-seeding. Plants have escaped gardens in many parts of the U.S. and may be considered invasive in some areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia marginata, commonly called snow-on-the-mountain, is a warm-weather annual that is native to prairies from Minnesota and the Dakotas to Colorado and Texas. In Missouri, it is native to the loess mounds in the far northwestern corner of the State (Steyermark). This is a single-stemmed plant that typically grows to 1-3' tall. It is usually unbranched below the inflorescence. Leaves (1-3"" long) are medium green in spring, with the upper leaves gradually developing showy clean white margins. Compound cymes of inconspicuous greenish-yellow true flowers bloom at the stem ends from mid-summer to early fall. Although the true flowers (borne in cyathia) lack sepals or petals and are not showy, these flowers are subtended by long-lasting, petal-like white bracts (modified leaves) that are showy. Flower bracts and variegated upper leaves provide the ornamental show. Plant sap is a milky juice that is toxic if ingested.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet is in reference to the white leaf margins.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where plants are best grown in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Plants react poorly to temperatures that dip below 35 degrees F. in winter.  Appreciates some midday shade in hot summer climates.  Plants are tolerant of poor soils, including rocky-sandy ones.  Plants are also tolerant of dry soils, but regular applications of moderate moisture may result in better bloom with less leaf drop.  Wet soils, particularly in winter, can be fatal.  Best located in areas with good air circulation.  Indoor plants need bright light and are best grown with a gritty soil-based potting mix.  Propagate from tip cuttings. Wear gloves when working with this plant.  Sticky white latex sap is poisonous (avoid contact with skin, mouth or eyes).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia milii, commonly called crown of thorns, is a woody, succulent shrub that features (a) fleshy, bright green leaves, (b) inconspicuous flowers in clusters subtended by very showy petal-like red or yellow bracts and (c)  thick sharp black thorns (to 1/2"" long) which cover its water-storing branches and stems.   Common name refers to the belief by some that the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ at the crucifixion was made from stems of this plant (historical evidence suggests this Madagascar native may have been introduced to the Middle East prior to  the birth of Christ).  In Madagascar, this shrub typically grows in a sprawling form to 5-6' tall.  Outdoors in southern Florida, it typically grows to 3' tall.  As a houseplant, it grows at best to 2' tall.  Obovate bright green leaves (to 2 1/2"" long) have wedge-shaped bases.  Leaves are produced on new stem growth.  Inconspicuous greenish true flowers, borne in cyathia, lack both petals and sepals, but are subtended  by long-lasting, colorful, petal-like, bright red or yellow bracts which are exceptionally showy.  In tropical and sub-tropical locations, flowers will bloom throughout the year, but primarily in spring and summer.  In Florida, flowers bloom primarily in winter and spring.  Houseplants often bloom from late winter well into fall.  Many cultivars are available in commerce.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet honors Baron Milius, one-time Governor of the island of Bourbon, who reportedly introduced this species to cultivation in France in 1821.

Culture
Best grown in medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Tolerant of wet soils and can grow in shallow water.  Established plants, on the other hand, tolerate some soil dryness.  Plants generally appreciate some afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Clumps tend to open up and lose their attractive shape in too much shade.  Best with sharply-drained soils, however this species tolerates heavier soils than most other species of spurge.  Plants are tolerant of poor soils, including rocky-sandy ones.  Plants generally prefer a Mediterranean-type climate and may show some stress in hot and humid summers.  Wear gloves when working with this plant because plant sap may irritate the skin.  Remove flower heads after bloom.  Will self-seed in the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia palustris, commonly called marsh euphorbia or spurge, is an upright,  clump-forming, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 2-3' (infrequently to 5') tall.  It is native to marshland in Europe and western Asia.  Inconspicuous, greenish true flowers (lack both petals and sepals) bloom in late spring to early summer (June-July).  Although these true flowers (borne in large 6"" wide clusters known as cyathia) are not particularly showy, they are subtended by large, long-lasting, greenish-yellow bracts which are exceptionally showy.  Flower color in effect comes from the floral bracts.  Elliptic stem leaves (to 2-3"" long) and narrower axillary branch leaves are medium green but turn yellow and orange/red in fall.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet from Latin means marsh-loving.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some gardeners experience skin rashes from contact with the toxic sticky plant sap of euphorbias.  Aphids, mealybugs, nematodes and spider mites may appear.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia pulcherrima, commonly called poinsettia, is the most widely grown of all shrubby euphorbias.  In Mexico it is a straggly deciduous shrub. Inconspicuous yellow flowers are surrounded by large brilliant red floral bracts (modified leaves) in winter through spring. Contrary to conventional wisdom, poinsettia plants are not a poisonous plant. A Ohio State University study showed that a 50 pound child could eat 500 bracts and might have a slight stomach ache. However, the white sap can have allergic properties, especially for people who have latex allergies.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet means pretty.The common name of poinsettia recognizes Joel R. Poinsette (1775-1851) a gardener, botanist and diplomat from South Carolina who was ambassador to Mexico in 1824. He brought the plant back to South Carolina.
","
Problems
Problems may include whitefly, mealybugs, red spider mites and scale. Root or stem rots can also occur if overwatered. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Grown primarily as a pot plant, poinsettias are a big industry representing about 85% of potted plant Christmas season sales. The USA exports about 90% of the world’s poinsettia plants. It is thought that poinsettias are grown commercially in greenhouses in all 50 states and over 60 million plants are produced for sale.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia rigida is native to the Mediterranean region (southern Europe to southwest Asia).  It is a shrubby, evergreen, perennial spurge that typically grows in a clump to 2' tall and 3' wide on upright ascending stems.  Fleshy, succulent-like, pointed-at-the-tip, lanceolate, steely blue-green leaves (to 1 1/2' long) are arranged in close spirals around the stems.  Non-showy greenish true flowers are subtended by showy chartreuse-yellow bracts.  Flowers bloom in domed heads at the stem tips in spring (April-June).  When cut or bruised, the stems exude a milky sap which may be irritating to the skin and eyes (wear gloves when working with this plant).  Foliage acquires interesting red to bronze tones in fall.  This is a deer resistant plant.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Euphorbia biglandulosa.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet is in reference to the erect stems (by contrast the similar Euphorbia myrsinites has more prostrate stems).

Culture
Tropical to semi-tropical tree or shrub that is reliably winter hardy to USDA Zone 11, but is currently surviving in the far southern parts of Florida and California in Zone 10.  This plant is typically grown outdoors in the type of soils loved by desert cacti, but with less arid conditions.  Prefers dry to dryish atmospheric conditions in sharply-drained soils that are nourishing but without high organic content.  Plants can grow in full sun but appreciate some part afternoon shade in hot summer conditions.  Avoid excessive watering.  Best performance typically occurs when daytime temperatures do not exceed 75 degrees F. and nighttime temperatures do not dip below 50 degrees F. 

Container plants perform best in coarse loams enriched with a fairly liberal amount of peat moss or leaf mold plus additional gritty material such as coarse sand, perlite, or broken clam shells.  Bonemeal is a good additive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euphorbia tirucalli, commonly known under a large number of common names including Indian tree spurge, milk bush, pencil tree, finger tree, aveloz or petroleum plant, is a dioecious, single to multiple trunked, succulent, cactus-like, milky-sapped tree that typically matures to 20-30’ tall with a spread to 10’ wide.  It lacks spines and is generally considered to be the least cactus-like of the tree spurges.  It is primarily native to semi-arid tropical parts of eastern and southern Africa, but was introduced with subsequent naturalization occurring many years ago along the Arab trading routes from the Arabian Peninsula across the Indian Ocean to India and Indonesia.  It typically develops a heavy trunk with thick primary branches which are woody and brown.  New branchlets are green with a short cylindrical shape having a pencil-like thickness, often forming clusters at the branch ends.   Cyathia (flower structures) are located at the tops of the branchlets in stalk-less clusters, featuring large petal-like showy bracts which typically hide the inconspicuous tiny yellowish flowers within.  Tiny leaves (to 1” long) are oblanceolate.    

This plant effectively grows in tropical to semi-tropical climates as a shrub, screen or hedge plus indoors in more temperate climates as a houseplant.  Plant parts contain a milky sap which is poisonous if ingested and will often cause on contact a variety of allergic reactions to skin and eyes, including temporary blindness.  Wear gloves when working with this plant to avoid contact with its toxic sap.    

Species plants are currently being touted in some circles as being a potential medical treatment for cancer.  

Additional potential uses include being a source of oil (some claim that plants might be capable of producing 10 to 50 barrels of oil per acre) which technically translates into the further claim that a planting the size of the State of Arizona could meet current yearly requirements for gasoline in the U.S. on a yearly basis.Genus name probably honors Euphorbus, physician to the King of Mauretania.Specific epithet comes from the Indian-Malayalam names of tiru meaning good and kalli meaning medicinal plant qualities.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to nematodes, spider mites, aphids, and mealybugs.  Fungal and bacterial diseases may appear.
","
Garden Uses
In tropical or semi-tropical climates, it may be grown outdoors as a specimen or background plant.  It is also effectively grown as a shrub, hedge or screen.  Interesting addition to desert gardens.   

Where not winter hardy, it may be grown indoors as a houseplant.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eutrochium fistulosum, commonly called hollow Joe Pye weed, is a tall Missouri native perennial which uncommonly occurs in low moist ground, wet meadows, wet thickets and stream margins mostly in the far southeastern corner of the State. It is an erect, clump-forming perennial which typically grows 4-7' tall and features coarsely-serrated, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 12"" long) in whorls of 4-7 (frequently 6) on sturdy green stems which are hollow. Tiny, vanilla-scented, dull pinkish-purple flowers in large, terminal, domed, compound inflorescenses (12-18"" diameter) bloom in mid-summer to early fall. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies. Flowers give way to attractive seed heads which persist well into winter. Hollow Joe Pye weed is similar in appearance to both spotted Joe Pye weed (E. maculatum) and sweet Joe Pye weed (E. purpureum, but is primarily distinguished by its larger leaf whorls and hollow stems which usually lack spotting.Genus name is derived from the Greek words eu meaning well and troche meaning wheel-like in reference to the whorled leaves.Specific epithet means hollow.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaves may scorch if soils are allowed to dry out.
","
Garden Uses
Many people perceive Joe Pye weed to be nothing more than a roadside weed and have never seriously considered its outstanding ornamental attributes. It is a substantial plant which needs space, but when planted in groups or massed can provide spectacular flowering and architectural height.

Eutrochium purpureum, commonly called Joe Pye weed, is a tall Missouri native perennial that occurs in low moist ground, wooded slopes, wet meadows and thickets and stream margins throughout the State (Steyermark). It is an erect, clump-forming perennial which typically grows 4-7’ tall and features coarsely-serrated, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 12” long) in whorls of 3-4 on sturdy green stems with purplish leaf nodes. Tiny, vanilla-scented, dull pinkish-purple flowers in large, terminal, domed, compound inflorescences bloom in mid-summer to early fall. Each flower cluster typically has 5-7 florets. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies. Flowers give way to attractive seed heads which persist well into winter.Genus name is derived from the Greek words eu meaning well and troche meaning wheel-like in reference to the whorled leaves.Specific epithet means purple.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaves may scorch if soils are allowed to dry out. Powdery mildew and rust may occur.
","
Garden Uses
Many people perceive Joe Pye weed to be nothing more than a roadside weed and have never seriously considered its outstanding ornamental attributes. It is a substantial plant which needs space, but when planted in groups or massed can provide spectacular flowering and architectural height. Border rears, cottage gardens, meadows, native plant gardens, wild/naturalized areas or water margins.

Culture
A tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9 to 11. In the St. Louis area, it is grown as an annual in hanging baskets and containers or in the ground as a bedding plant or ground cover. Starter plants are often available from local nurseries in cell packs in spring. Cuttings may be taken from established plants in summer for overwintering indoors in bright but cool locations with reduced watering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Evolvulus glomeratus is a non-vining morning glory-like tender perennial with trailing stems that is native to Brazil. If planted in the ground as a bedding plant, it typically forms sprawling foliage mounds to 9-18” tall. Trailing stems tend to grow somewhat horizontally to downward when planted in baskets or containers. Flowers usually close up at night and on cloudy days. Sometimes listed synonymous with E. pilosus, which adds considerable taxonomic confusion since E. pilosus is also sometimes listed as being synonymous with E. nuttallianus, a small-flowered native North American species that is winter hardy to USDA Zone 4.Genus name comes from the Latin word evolvo meaning to untwist or unravel as this convolvulus family genus does not twine.Specific epithet means clustered into more or less rounded heads.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Evolvulus nuttallianus is native from Montana and North Dakota south to Texas and Arizona. In Missouri, it is found on limestone glades and bald knobs in the Ozark region of the State (Steyermark). It is a non-vining morning glory-like perennial that grows as a densely hairy subshrub to 20” tall with prostrate to decumbent stems that root at the nodes as they go. Features very small, bell-shaped, lavender to blue morning glories (to 1/2” across) from spring to mid-summer on stems clad with oblanceolate, hairy, silvery-green leaves (to 1” long). Flowers usually close up at night and on cloudy days. It must be noted that there is considerable confusion in the taxonomy of the genus Evolvulus. The within native species is sometimes listed as synonymous with E. pilosus (e.g., see Stemermark).Genus name comes from the Latin word evolvo meaning to untwist or unravel as this convolvulus family genus does not twine.Specific epithet honors British botanist Thomas Nuttall (1786-1839) who traveled extensively in the U.S.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Exochorda racemosa, commonly called pearlbush, is native to China. It is a loose, upright, early-blooming, deciduous shrub with a broad rounded shape. It typically matures to 10-15’ tall and as wide. The flower buds resemble white pearls, hence the common name. Flowers bloom in spring (late April in St. Louis) in 6-10 flowered racemes, each flower (to 1.5” diameter) being 5-petaled, cup-shaped and white. Flowers give way to brown dehiscent seed capsules. Narrow, elliptic to oblong, medium green leaves (to 3” long). No fall color. Although floriferous and attractive in early spring, it basically plods though the rest of the growing season as a somewhat nondescript shrub.Genus name comes from the Greek words exo meaning outside and chorde meaning a cord referring to fibers outside the placenta in the ovary.Specific epithet means with flowers in racemes.

Best grown in deep, rich, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Intolerant of wet, poorly drained soils. Difficult to transplant and does not always grow well in urban settings. In the wild, beeches often form thickets or colonies by suckering from the shallow roots.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fagus grandifolia, commonly called American beech, is native to eastern North America. It is a large deciduous tree typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 120’) tall with a dense, upright-oval to rounded-spreading crown. In Missouri, it occurs in rich woods of ravines, slopes and valleys only in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark). It is a low-branched tree with its mature trunk ranging from 2-3’ (less frequently 4’) in diameter. Trunks have distinctive thin, smooth, gray bark. Ovate to elliptic dark green leaves (to 5” long) have coarse, widely-spaced marginal teeth and prominent parallel veins, each vein ending at the tip of a marginal tooth. Foliage turns golden bronze in fall. Monoecious yellowish green flowers bloom in April-May, the male flowers in drooping, long-stemmed, globular clusters and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to triangular nuts enclosed by spiny bracts. Beechnuts ripen in fall and are edible.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means large-leaved.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fagus sylvatica, commonly called European beech, is a large deciduous tree typically growing to 50-60’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a dense, upright-oval to rounded-spreading crown. It is native to woodlands in central and southern Europe. European colonists brought this tree to America in the mid-1700s and it has been a popular ornamental shade tree since that time. European beech is primarily distinguished from the similar American beech (see Fagus grandifolia) by (a) smaller size, (b) darker gray bark, and (c) shorter leaves that have wavy mostly untoothed margins. It is a low-branched tree, with its trunk ranging from 2-3’ (less frequently 4’) in diameter. Trunks have distinctive bark that is thin, smooth and gray. Ovate to elliptic, lustrous dark green leaves (to 4” long) have wavy mostly toothless margins and prominent parallel veins. Foliage turns golden bronze in fall. Monoecious yellowish green flowers bloom in April-May, the male flowers in drooping, long-stemmed, globular clusters and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to triangular nuts enclosed by spiny bracts. Beechnuts ripen in fall and are edible. Many cultivars are available in commerce in a variety of different forms, leaf shapes and leaf colors.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means growing in woods or forest-loving.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Beech scale is an occasional problem. Watch for aphids, Japanese beetles and caterpillars. Distressed trees may be attacked by borers. Beech bark disease, canker and powdery mildew may occur.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fatsia japonica, commonly called Japanese aralia, is native to Japan. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows to 16’ tall in its native habitat. Plants must be grown indoors in St. Louis where they more typically grow to 6’ tall. This is an attractive foliage plant noted for its palmately lobed glossy dark green leaves (to 16” wide) that typically have 7-9 deep lobes. Small creamy flowers in umbels bloom in fall, followed by black berries. However, plants rarely flower and fruit indoors. Synonymous with Aralia sieboldii and Aralia japonica.Genus name comes from the Latinized adaptation of an obsolete or misrendered Japanese name Fatsi for Fatsia japonica.Specific epithet means of Japan.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it may be grown as a perennial. North of Zone 10, it is typically grown as an annual. Plants perform well in average, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid wet soils. Plants dislike the hot and humid summers of the deep South. In St. Louis, purchase plants in cell packs from local nurseries in spring. Plants may also be grown from seed started indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date so plants will produce good bloom in advance of the onset of hot summer weather. In cool summer climates, seed may be sown outdoors in the ground around the last spring frost date. Cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Felicia amelloides, commonly called blue daisy or blue marguerite, is native to South Africa. It is a bushy, aster-like, woody-based subshrub that typically grows to 2’ tall. It is primarily grown for its long and showy bloom of daisy-like flowers (to 1.5” diameter) featuring sky blue rays and yellow centers. In cool northern summers, flowers bloom throughout summer into fall (sometimes to frost). In hot southern summers, flowering usually declines or stops by mid-summer as consistent high temperatures become the norm. Rough-hairy, ovate green leaves (to 1” long) resemble leaves in the genus Amellus (also native to South Africa), hence the specific epithet. Felicia amelloides is synonymous with and formerly known as Felicia aethiopica, Aster amelloides, Aster capensis and Aster coelestis.Genus name honors Felix, a German official at Regensburg, who died in 1846.Specific epithet means resemble the genus Amellus.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Aphids and spider mites can be troublesome. Root may occur, particularly in wet soils. Watch for botrytis.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade, but best foliage color is in full sun.  Tolerant of some drought and poor soils, but best performance occurs when plants receive regular and consistent moisture throughout the growing season.  Intolerant of wet, poorly-drained soils.  In the St. Louis area, foliage is semi-evergreen in that it may retain some color in mild winters, but clumps will show considerable browning in harsh winters.  Clumps tend to die out in the center and need to be divided and replanted or replaced every 2-3 years.  Cut back foliage in early spring to 3-4” to tidy clumps and to facilitate emergence of the new leaf blades.  Clumps may decline in hot, humid summers, and should be cut back if such occurs.  Mass densely (plant 8-10” apart) when planting as a ground cover since clumps spread outward rather slowly.  Species plants will self-seed in the garden.‘Klose’ should be propagated by division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Festuca amethystine, commonly known as tufted fescue, hair fescue or large blue fescue, is an evergreen to semi-evergreen, tufted, fine-textured, blue-green, cool season grass with thin hair-like blades that typically grows in dense fountain-like clumps to 12” tall.  Slender stalks rise above the foliage in late spring to early summer (June) to 18-24” tall bearing terminal panicles of amethyst (violet) flowers.  Color of the grass ranges from blue-green to gray-blue.  This grass is native to Central Europe.Genus name comes from the Latin word meaning a grass stalk or straw.Specific epithet means violet-colored.‘Klose’ is an ornamental cultivar that is noted for its attractive olive green foliage.  It typically forms a foliage clump to a compact 8” tall.  Foliage emerges bluish-green in spring, maturing to olive green.  It may bronze in hot summers.  Foliage typically forms a tuft of erect to arching, needle-like blades radiating upward and outward to a height of 6-8” (inflorescences typically bring total clump height to 10-14”).  Light green flowers with a purple tinge appear in terminal panicles atop slender stalks rising well above the foliage in late spring to early summer.  Flowers give way to buffy seed heads which some gardeners find attractive but others find detractive to both the symmetry of the plant and the foliage color. 

Cultivar name honors German nurseryman Heinz Klose.
","
Problems
Plants are short-lived and require frequent division.  Plant foliage may decline considerably in hot, humid summers. Wet soils in winter can be very harmful.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent as a clumping ground cover or path edger.  Border fronts.  Rock garden accent.  Cottage gardens.  Containers.

Culture
Red fescue is a fine-leaved turfgrass that does well in part shade and grows best in cool climates as in the coastal northwest, Great Lakes area or at high elevations. It has good drought tolerance and requires low to medium amounts of fertilizer (1 to 3 lbs. nitrogen per 1,000 sq. ft.) It can be blended with tall fescue or bluegrass and has the ability to creep by rhizomes. Seeding rates are about 2 to 4 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Red fescue is the most commonly used cool season turfgrass in shade and dry, drought-prone areas. It can be mixed with other fescues and bluegrass to provide a full sun to shade blend. Its maintenance requirement is low to medium and should be mowed at about 2 to 3"". It can be left unmowed for a meadow look, if desired.
","
Problems
Red fescue does not wear well and is slow to recuperate when thinned out or damaged. It is very susceptible to summer diseases in hot climates and this can become more notable in fertile, moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Frequently used under shade conditions such as beneath the canopy of trees. Blend with bluegrass or tall fescue.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. Grow as a houseplant in St. Louis. Easily grown in a soil-based potting mix. Site in bright indirect light or in sunny areas with some afternoon shade. Water regularly during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering. Reduce watering from fall to late winter. This plant may be taken outside in spring after last frost date and brought back inside in fall. Prune to shape as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ficus benjamina, commonly called weeping fig, is native from India to northern Australia. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree that grows to 50’ tall. It is widely grown in the tropics as an ornamental tree or hedge. For many years, it has been an extremely popular indoor houseplant because of its attractive shape and tolerance for a variety of growing conditions. Houseplants are more often grown in the 2-10’ tall range. Pale brownish trunk with a dense cone of foliage. Trunks are sometimes braided for ornamental interest. Glossy, pointed, oval to elliptic leaves (to 4” long). Twigs arch gracefully. Stems have milky sap. This tree rarely flowers or fruits indoors. Even if flowers were produced, fruit production would still be unlikely in large part because of the absence of the necessary pollinating wasps.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the edible fig.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale, aphids, mealybugs, thrips and spider mites. Dieback and leaf spots may occur. Plants may lose some foliage when brought indoors for winter or if moved to a different environment within the home. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants

Culture
Figs are best grown in USDA Zones 8-10 in organically rich, moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Figs may be grown in protected locations in USDA Zones 6 and 7 (e.g., against south-facing walls) with root mulch, but plants will usually show significant die back in cold winters. When temperatures in winter dip below 15 degrees F., consider additional protection for outdoor plants to the extent possible (e.g., clear plastic sheets or frames). In USDA Zones 5 and 6, figs can be grown as low-branching shrubs that are “laid down” in winter (branches are bent over and covered with soil with soil also mounded over the main trunking). Many fig cultivars are now available, with ‘Brown Turkey’ and ‘Chicago Hardy’ being noted for having unusually good winter hardiness. In St. Louis, plants are best grown in containers in full sun. Water regularly during the growing season but reduce watering in fall. Containers must be brought indoors in winter. Large containers may be overwintered in greenhouses, garages or basements.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ficus carica, commonly called common fig, is a deciduous shrub (to 10-15’ tall) or small tree (to 15-30’ tall).  It is noted for its spreading habit, attractive foliage and edible fruit.  Old trees with smooth silver-gray bark (sometime gnarled with age) are ornamentally attractive.  Large, palmate, hairy, 3-5 lobed leaves (to 10” long) are rough dark green above and smooth light green beneath.  Non-showy greenish flowers form in spring inside hollow receptacles near the branch growing tips.  The fruit (edible fig) develops within each receptacle.  The main fruit crop ripens in late summer or fall on new wood.  In some areas, a lesser crop may appear in spring on new wood.  Species plants as well as most fig cultivars are parthenocarpic (fruits develop without cross pollination).Genus name comes from the Latin name for the edible fig.Specific epithet refers to Caria, a district in Asia Minor known for growing figs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for root knot nematodes, scale, aphids, mealybugs and spider mites. Leaf spots, rust and blight may occur. Fruit can become a mess if not promptly harvested.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental or fruit tree. In Missouri, plants may be grown in sheltered locations outdoors with root mulch or in containers that are overwintered indoors.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ficus elastica, commonly called India rubber plant, India rubber tree or India rubber fig, is native from the Himalayas to Malaysia, Sumatra and Java. It is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or tree that may grow to 50-100’ tall in its native habitat. It is widely grown in the tropics as an ornamental tree. Mature trees develop banyan-like aerial roots that form trunks. In colder climates, this is an extremely popular houseplant that typically grows to 2-10’ tall. It is noted for its thick, leathery, glossy, dark green leaves (to 12” long and 5” wide) and pink to purplish stipules. Milky sap from these trees was used to make an inferior rubber in the early 1900s. Small oblong axillary fruits (1/2” diameter) in pairs are rarely seen on plants outside of its tropical native habitat.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the edible fig.Specific epithet refers to the milky sap that can be used to produce rubber.Popular variations include ‘Decora’ (larger leaves with ivory midrib) and ‘Variegata’ (narrow leaves with yellow/green margins).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ficus pumila, commonly called creeping fig, is a vigorous, fast-growing, evergreen, climbing vine that from a distance simply does not look much like a fig. Where it may be grown outdoors, it will climb and cover walls, posts, trellises and other structures by adhesive aerial rootlets. Outdoor plants can grow to 15’ or more. On climbing stems, juvenile foliage consists of ovate, heart-shaped leaves to 1” long. On fruit-bearing stems, mature foliage is oblong to elliptic, thicker, shinier and larger (to 4” long). Hairy pear-shaped fruits (to 2.5” long) may appear on outdoor plants throughout the year. Fruits emerge green ripening to purple. Flowers and fruits rarely appear on indoor plants. Stems have a milky sap. Indoors, this plant may be grown on room-dividing trellises or in hanging baskets or sprawling over a shelf. Varieties available in commerce include ones with variegated foliage and with oak-like lobed leaves. Synonymous with F. repens.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the edible fig.Specific epithet means dwarf.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ficus religiosa, commonly called bo tree, Bodhi tree, peepul and sacred fig, is native to Southeast Asia, southwest China, India and the Himalayan foothills. It is a large broadleaf evergreen tree with wide-spreading branching that grows to 60-100’ tall. Over time, the trunk may grow to as much as 9' in diameter. In native monsoon climates, this tree is semi-deciduous to deciduous. It is epiphytic. Tree seed (often deposited by birds) may germinate in upper tree crevices, producing dangling, non-parasitic, aerial roots that grow to the ground, root in the soil and produce trunks. Figs that begin as epiphytes are often generally called Banyans (although the Banyan name is sometimes used only for Ficus benghalensis). Bo tree develops an attractive pale gray bark. Ovate-rounded, glossy, dark green leaves (to 7"" long) are cordate with distinctive, extremely narrow, elongated tips. In its native habitat, the fruits of this tree (globular figs to 1/2” diameter) appear solitary or in pairs, emerging green but ripening to purple. Bo tree is sacred to followers of Buddhism and Hinduism because Guatama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, reportedly sat under such a tree (known as the Bodhi tree) when he received enlightenment (bodhi). The oldest plant in the world of known planting date is the Ficus religiosa tree called Sri Maha Bodhi which was planted at the temple at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, in 288 B. C. Today the bo tree is revered as a symbol for prosperity, happiness, good fortune and long life.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the edible fig.Specific epithet means sacred or with religious connections.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Filipendula rubra, commonly called queen of the prairie, is a U.S. native perennial which ranges from Pennsylvania to Georgia and west to Iowa and Missouri. In Missouri, it is only found in several swampy, calcareous meadows in Reynolds County (Steyermark). It is a very tall, upright, clump-forming perennial that typically grows 6-8' tall and features branched, terminal, astilbe-like, 6-9"" wide panicles (corymbs) of tiny, fragrant, pale pink flowers in early to mid summer. Deeply cut, compound-pinnate, bright green leaves have 7-9 lance-shaped leaflets each, with an unusually large, 7-9 lobed, terminal leaflet (4-8"" long). Leaves are fragrant. A good foliage plant that is valued for both its leaves and its flowers.Genus name comes from the Latin words filum meaning a thread and pendulus meaning hanging for the root tubers in some species that hang together with threads.Specific epithet means red.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Though quite tall, this sturdy plant usually does not need staking.
","
Garden Uses
This is a large plant for large gardens. Can be spectacular, particularly when massed. Borders (rear), cottage gardens, native plant gardens, wild/naturalized areas, wet meadows or moist areas along streams or ponds.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Filipendula ulmaria, commonly called meadowsweet or queen-of-the-meadow, is a large, clump-forming, upright perennial that typically grows 3-4' (less frequently to 6') tall and features branched, terminal, astilbe-like panicles (4-6"") of fragrant, creamy white flowers in early to mid summer. Compound, pinnate, dark green leaves (7-9 leaflets each) are hairy and whitish beneath. Although native to Europe and Asia, this species has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of eastern North America.Genus name comes from the Latin words filum meaning a thread and pendulus meaning hanging for the root tubers in some species that hang together with threads.Specific epithet means resembling Ulmus the genus name of elms.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Often appreciates some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Prefers consistently moist, fertile, humusy soils, but tolerates dry soils, and is more drought tolerant than other species of Filipendula. Prefers soils that are neutral to slightly alkaline. Propagate by dividing clumps in spring. Plants will freely self-seed. With sufficient moisture, foliage may remain attractive throughout the growing season. If foliage depreciates in late summer, cut it back after bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Filipendula vulgaris, commonly called dropwort, is an upright, clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 2-3' tall. It is native to dry limestone grasslands in Europe and Asia. Compound-pinnate, finely-divided, dark green leaves (4-10"" long) contain many pairs of leaflets (to 1"" long). Plant leaves primarily appear in basal rosettes, typically forming a mound of foliage to 12"" tall. Foliage has a carrot-like or fern-like appearance. Tiny, fragrant, creamy white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer in branched, astilbe-like, terminal panicles (corymbs) that rise well above the foliage mound to 2-3' tall atop sparsely leaved stems. Plants have tuberous spreading rootstocks. Filipendula hexapetala is now included within Filipendula vulgaris.Genus name comes from the Latin words filum meaning a thread and pendulus meaning hanging for the root tubers in some species that hang together with threads.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Plants are susceptible to powdery mildew.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where it is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in locations protected from strong winds. Best with regular moisture, although established trees develop some drought resistance. Trees will self-seed somewhat aggressively.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Firmiana simplex, commonly called Chinese parasol tree, is a small to medium-sized upright deciduous tree with a rounded crown. It is native to China, Korea, Japan and southeast Asia. It was introduced into the U. S. in the 1850s, and has naturalized over time in the Southeast from Virginia to Florida and Texas as well as in California. It typically grows 30-45’ tall. It is perhaps best noted for its very large, palmately-veined, 3-5 lobed leaves (to 12” across) that are bright green above and pubescent below. Leaves turn an undistinguished yellow in fall. Mildly fragrant, star-shaped, yellowish-green flowers (to 3/4” wide) in long terminal panicles (to 12”) bloom mostly at the twig ends in early summer. Flowers give way to leathery capsules that split open when ripe (autumn) into 4 or 5 sections, each section containing 1 to 3 seeds. Smooth greenish bark on the young branches and trunk is somewhat unusual. Additional common names for this tree are varnish tree (seed pods release a brownish, varnish-like fluid as they open) and phoenix tree (supernatural phoenix bird of Chinese legend perched on Firmiana trees). Synonymous with and formerly called Firmiana platanifolia.Genus name honors Karl Josef von Firmian (1716-1782), Governor of Lombardy, when that was a province of the Austrian Empire, and a patron of the Padua botanic garden.Specific epithet is in reference to the simple (as opposed to compound) leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Landscape tree. Near patio. Woodland garden. Shade tree. Street tree (although fruit/leaf litter is messy). Seed pods may be picked for indoor decoration use.

Culture
Easily grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. May be grown from seed that is sown directly in the garden in spring. Freely self-seeds in the garden. Remove spent flowering stems before seed is produced to avoid any unwanted self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Foeniculum vulgare, called common fennel, is an upright, branching perennial that is typically grown in vegetable and herb gardens for its anise-flavored foliage and seeds, both of which are commonly harvested for use in cooking. It somewhat resembles a very large dill plant. It grows to 3-5’ (less frequently to 6’) tall and features feathery, compound, aromatic, yellow-green leaves with needle-like segments and tiny yellow flowers in large, flattened, compound umbels. Flowers bloom in mid- to late summer, and are followed by aromatic seeds. Plants have escaped gardens and naturalized in many parts of North America. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies. Fennel is a larval plant for certain swallowtail butterflies.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this traditional salad and potherb which, in Italian, is called finocchio.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Stem and root rot may occur, especially in poorly-drained soils. Watch for aphids and slugs. Larvae (caterpillars) of swallowtail butterflies may chew on the foliage.
","
Garden Uses
Borders, vegetable gardens, herb gardens, cottage gardens or meadows. Good plant for a butterfly garden. Seeds are commonly harvested for use as flavoring in a variety of foods such as bakery products or sausages. Chopped leaves may be used as flavoring for salads, potatoes or fish.

Culture
Easily grown in loose, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best flower production occurs in full sun. Tolerates a wide variety of soils.  Moderate drought tolerance once established.  Shrubs are vegetatively winter hardy to USDA Zones 4-7.  This species of forsythia is considered to have excellent flower bud hardiness (typically blooms after buds have survived winter temperatures dipping to as much as -25 degrees F.).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Forsythia ovate, commonly called early forsythia or Korean forsythia, is a compact, bushy, early-flowering, deciduous shrub that typically matures to 4-5’ tall with a spread to 5-7’ wide.  It is native to Korea.  Ovate to broad-ovate dark green leaves (each to 3 1/2” long) usually have serrate margins.  Small, mostly solitary, amber yellow flowers (each to 3/ 4” wide) are probably the earliest blooming (late February to April) of the various species of forsythia.  This shrub is particularly noted for its (a) flower bud hardiness and (b) early bloom time.  

Ornamentally, this is an unexceptional shrub.  It is easy to grow in the landscape and is generally free of serious pests, but features small flowers, non-showy foliage, absence of attractive fruit, and no bright fall colors.  Although often described as a harbinger of spring because its flowers bloom at a time when little else in the landscape is in bloom, it is also often described as a one-season wonder because it typically fades into the landscape after bloom.Genus name honors William Forsyth (1737-1804), Scottish superintendent of the Royal Gardens of Kensington Palace and author, among other works, of A Treatise on the Culture and Management of Fruit Trees which in its day was probably the most widely read work on the subject.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to its ovate leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Adapts to wide range of soils. Best flower production in full sun. Prune immediately after spring flowering (wide range of pruning options include simply removing old stems and shaping to cutting back to the ground to revitalize). If left alone, plants may colonize an area over time because weeping branches often root where they touch the ground.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Forsythia suspensa, commonly called weeping forsythia, is an upright, arching, deciduous shrub most noted for its weeping habit. As a shrub, it typically grows 6-10' tall and as wide, but weeping branches may be trained on a support structure to grow somewhat taller as a woody vine. Golden 4-petaled flowers appear in profusion before the foliage in late winter to early spring. One of the earliest blooming shrubs... a true harbinger of spring. Opposite, serrate, ovate, simple to trifoliate, medium green leaves (to 4"" long). No appreciable fall color. This species is native to China and is one of the parents of the popular Forsythia x intermedia hybrids.Genus name honors William Forsyth (1737-1804), Scottish superintendent of the Royal Gardens of Kensington Palace and author, among other works, of A Treatise on the Culture and Management of Fruit Trees which in its day was probably the most widely read work on the subject.Specific epithet means hanging.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to leaf spot and crown gall. Although vegetatively winter hardy to USDA Zone 5, the flower buds are sometimes damaged by cold winter temperatures and late freezes in Zone 5.
","
Garden Uses
Grown primarily for early spring accent and weeping branches. Group in borders. Mass on banks or slopes. Naturalize in sunny areas of open woodland gardens. Informal hedge. If planted above a wall, branches will cascade downward to cover the wall surface. May be trained to grow as a vine.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fothergilla gardenii, commonly known as dwarf fothergilla or coastal fothergilla, is a slow-growing, deciduous, dwarf ornamental shrub that is native to moist lowland coastal plain bogs and savannahs in the southeastern U.S. from North Carolina to the Florida panhandle and Alabama.  It is a compact, slow-growing, mounded, deciduous shrub that typically grows 2-3’ tall and as wide.  Apetalous flowers in dense terminal bottlebrush-like spikes (to 1-2"" long) bloom in spring (April-early May) before the leaves appear.  Only the male flowers have color (showy white filaments and yellow anthers).  Flowers are aromatic.  Thick, pubescent, oblong to obovate, blue-green to green leaves (to 2 1/2"" long) have marginal teeth from mid point to leaf apex and are rounded at the base.  Leaves turn often brilliant shades of yellow, orange and red in fall.  Fruit is an ornamentally insignificant, two-seeded, beaked capsule that matures in fall.Genus name honors Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), English physician and botanist who grew plants from around the world in his London garden.Specific epithet honors Alexander Garden (1730-1791), Scottish physician and plant enthusiast, who took up residence in Charleston, South Carolina in 1752 and first discovered, described and introduced Fothergilla gardenii to England.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fothergilla major, commonly called large fothergilla, tall fothergilla or mountain witch alder, is a member of the same family as witch hazel (Hamamelis).  It is native to the southeastern U.S., primarily in mountain woods, ravines and along stream banks in the southern Appalachians in North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.  It is a slow-growing, deciduous shrub that grows 6-10’ tall with an upright spreading habit.  It is noted for its aromatic spring flowers, quality summer foliage, excellent fall color and excellent disease resistance.  Terminal, bottlebrush-like spikes (1-3” long) of tiny, fragrant, apetalous, white flowers bloom in spring (April-early May) after the foliage emerges.  Flower color comes from the dense clusters of showy stamens (white filaments and yellowish anthers). Ovate to obovate dark green leaves (2-4” long) are leathery above and blue-gray beneath.  Leaves are typically toothed in the upper 2/3 of the leaf.  Foliage turns excellent shades of yellow, orange and red-purple in fall.  Fruit is a non-ornamental, beaked, egg-shaped two-seeded capsule (to 1/2” long) which  matures in fall, eventually bursting and explosively broadcasting the seed.  Fothergilla major is very similar to Fothergilla gardenia (native to coastal plains in the southeastern U.S.), except, inter alia,  Fothergilla major is (1) taller, (2) produces flowers as the leaves emerge, (3) leaves have more marginal teeth and (4) leaves are less pubescent on the undersides.Genus name honors Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), English physician and botanist who grew plants from around the world in his London garden.Specific epithet means bigger or larger.

Culture
Best grown in humusy, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers full sun. Plant will spread by runners and may self-seed if fruit is not harvested.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fragaria vesca, commonly called woodland strawberry, is a small-fruited, everbearing wild strawberry that is native to Europe and Asia. Varieties of the species are found in North America both naturally and as introduced. This is a compact, stemless, 4-8” tall plant that spreads indefinitely by runners that root as they go. Numerous, small, 5-petaled white flowers with yellow centers appear throughout summer. Tri-foliate, coarsely-toothed, green leaves. Flowers are followed by edible, bright red strawberries (1/2” long) that may be harvested throughout summer. Flowers and fruit are usually simultaneously present on plants in summer. Although Steyermark finds F. vesca var. americana to be present in Missouri, the common wild strawberry of Missouri is a similar species, F. virginiana var. illinoensis.Genus name comes from the Latin word fraga meaning strawberry presumably from fragrans meaning fragrant in reference to the perfume of the fruit.Specific epithet means edible.
","
Problems
Strawberries are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including anthracnose, leaf spots, rots, wilts, powdery mildew and blights. Insect visitors include spider mites and aphids. Leaf scorch may occur in hot summer climates. This species has good resistance to the aforementioned diseases and insects.
","
Garden Uses
Woodland strawberry is generally grown for its ornamental features because the fruits are so small. Native plant gardens. Edger or groundcover. Rock gardens. Open woodland areas. Also may be grown in containers or pots.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 4-9 where these plants are easily grown in fertile, moist to dry-mesic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers organically rich, sandy loams.  This is a cool-season perennial that grows best in spring and fall.  After setting fruit, plants may slow down or go dormant in hot summer months.  Plants flower reliably in spring, but the subsequent appearance of fruit is dependent upon climatic conditions.  Plants spread indefinitely by runners that root as they sprawl along the ground.  Plants generally dislike high summer heat, humidity and strong drying winds.  Propagate from runners.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fragaria virginiana, commonly called wild strawberry, is a ground-hugging herbaceous perennial that typically grows to 4-7” tall but spreads indefinitely by runners (stolons) which root to form new plants as they sprawl along the ground, often forming large colonies over time.  It is native to woodland openings, meadows, prairies, limestone glades and cleared areas including roadsides from Newfoundland to Alberta south to Georgia, Tennessee, and Oklahoma.  Each trifoliate leaf has three coarsely toothed leaflets (each leaflet to 2 1/2” long), with each leaf appearing on a slender stalk (to 6” long).  Five-petaled white flowers (to 3/4” across) with numerous yellow-anthered center stamens bloom in April-May in flat umbel-like clusters (4-6 flowers each) located separate from and below the leaves on stalks that do not exceed the length of the leaf stalk.  Flowers give way to achene-dotted ovoid fruits (strawberries) which mature to red in a much smaller size (to 1/2” and across) than fruits produced by cultivated strawberry plants.  Seeds are embedded in the pits of the strawberries.  Wild strawberries have a sweet tart flavor.  Botanically, the achenes are the true fruits and the red strawberries are actually false fruits (enlarged flower receptacles).  

Cultivated strawberries found in stores are hybrid crosses between F. virginiana (native to North America) and F. chiloensis (native to western coastal South America including Chile) which combine the excellent taste of the former with the larger fruit size of the latter.Genus name comes from the Latin word fraga meaning strawberry presumably from fragrans meaning fragrant in reference to the perfume of the fruit.Specific epithet means of Virginia.Historically, many plants in this genus were mulched with straw in order to combat the possible onset of fungal diseases, hence the common name of strawberry.
","
Problems
Strawberries are susceptible to a large number of potential diseases, including but not limited to:  foliage diseases (leaf spot, scorch), root rots (red stele, black root rot), fruit rots (anthracnose, leather rot), gray mold and viruses.  Tarnished plant bugs, spider mites, aphids, leafrollers, slugs, nematodes and strawberry weevils are occasional insect problems
","
Garden Uses
Ground cover or border plant.  Woodland gardens.  Erosion control on slopes.  Fruits are quite small but very tasty and may be eaten fresh off the vine or cooked into a variety of dishes including pies and jams.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers consistent moisture. Adapts to a variety of soils. Species plants will self-seed, but new seedlings are not always true. Self-seeding can occur in optimum conditions. Best propagated from cuttings. Plant 24-30” apart for a hedge that may be pruned to desired height.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Frangula alnus is commonly called alder buckthorn because it is frequently seen in the wild growing in moist soils near alders (genus Alnus). It is also commonly called glossy buckthorn in reference to its glossy leaves. Glossy, oval to obovate, dark green leaves (to 3” long) retain green color well into fall, usually resulting in poor fall color. Insignificant whitish-green flowers appear in axillary clusters in May-June. Flowers are attractive to bees. Flowers are followed by inedible berries that ripen in July. Berries change from green to red to dark purple as they mature. Birds are attracted to the berries and help spread them over the landscape and into neighboring areas. This plant is considered invasive in parts of the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States. Check local laws before planting this species or any cultivars derived from it. Also consider choosing a native alternative such as common witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), blackhaw viburnum (Viburnum prunifolium), or black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa).The genus name Frangula comes from the word ""frango"", meaning fragile or brittle, in reference to the tendency of the twigs of some species to break easily.'Asplenifolia' is an upright, spreading, deciduous shrub which typically grows 6-10' tall. Clusters of whitish-green flowers appear in the leaf axils in May. Flowers are attractive to bees but not particularly showy. Flowers give way to green drupes (1/4"" across) which turn red and finally black over the period of July to September. Glossy green leaves are quite unusual in that they have the general appearance of fern pinnae: extremely narrow (to 2.5"" long but only 2"" wide) with irregular margins. Also sometimes commonly called fern-leaf buckthorn.
","
Problems
Japanese beetles, caterpillars and scale may appear. Nematodes can attack the roots. Watch for cankers, leaf spots and rust.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Must have good soil drainage. Consider raised plantings in poorly-drained heavy clay soils such as those present in much of the St. Louis area. Perhaps best in full sun in northern climates, but appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. May not be reliably winter hardy in the northern parts of USDA Zone 5 where it should be planted in a protected location. Hard to transplant because of its sparsely fibrous root system, and is best left undisturbed once planted in the landscape.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Franklinia alatamaha, commonly called Franklin tree, typically grows as a single-trunk tree with a rounded crown or as a multi-stemmed shrub.  As a single trunk tree, it can grow to 20’ tall or more, but is more often seen growing much shorter.  Camellia-like, cup-shaped, 5-petaled, sweetly-fragrant, white flowers (to 3” diameter) bloom in late summer to early fall.  Each flower sports a boss of egg-yolk yellow center stamens.  Narrow, oblong-obovate, glossy dark green leaves (to 5” long) turn quality shades of orange, red and purple in autumn.  John Bartram was appointed Royal Botanist for North America by King George III in 1765.  In that same year, John Bartram and his son William discovered franklinia growing in a 2-3 acre tract along the banks of the Altamaha River in southeastern Georgia.  Franklinia has never been observed growing in any other place than along the Altamaha River.  In a return trip in 1773, William Bartram collected seed from this site and brought it back to the Bartram's garden in Philadelphia where the tree was successfully grown.  This tree has been extinct in the wild since 1803.  It has been perpetuated in cultivation (all plants derive from the seed collected by Bartram) not only because of its rarity but also because of its attractive flowers and foliage.  The current genetic base of this plant is quite narrow in large part because all plants currently in existence in the world come from the materials collected by the Bartrams.  Franklinia belongs to the tea family and is closely related to Stewartia and Gordonia (loblolly bay).  It is not known why this tree disappeared in the wild.  Land along the Altamaha River was cleared for cotton plantations leading to one theory that a cotton pathogen found in the soil (carried downstream through erosion) was the main cause of the extinction of the colony.  Other extinction theories include decline from climate change, destruction by man, single colony of plants was not genetically diverse enough to withstand pathogens or changing conditions, or a local disaster (flood or fire).Genus name honors Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), American printer, scientist, philosopher and statesman.Specific epithet name has an extra ""a"" in it (apparently because of an alternate spelling for the river when the tree was named).
","
Problems
Wilt and root rot can be serious problems.  In general, this tree has a reputation for being difficult to grow.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen tree or large shrub valued for its late summer flowers, good fall color and interesting history. Franklinia deserves a prominent location in the landscape.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained loams in full sun.  Moderate drought tolerance.  Best sited in locations protected from strong winds.  Generally tolerant of urban conditions, particularly if well-sited in the landscape.   Tolerant of neutral to slightly alkaline soil conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fraxinus americana, commonly called white ash, is native to eastern North America.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in dry and rocky upland woods, glades and moist low woods along streams, bluffs and slopes throughout the state (Steyermark).   This is the largest of the native ashes, typically growing 60-80’ tall.  Young trees are pyramidal in shape, gradually maturing to a more rounded crown.  White ash is primarily dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Clusters of apetalous purplish male and female flowers appear on separate trees in April-May before the late-to-emerge foliage.  Fertilized female flowers give way to drooping clusters of winged samaras (to 2” long) that ripen in fall and may persist on the tree throughout winter.  Features odd-pinnate compound leaves with 7 leaflets (less frequently 5 or 9). Oval to oblong-lanceolate leaflets (3-5” long) are dark green above and whitish green below.  Foliage turns yellow with purple shading in fall.  Gray bark develops distinctive diamond-shaped ridging on mature trees.  White ash is a valuable timber tree.  Its wood is commercially used for a variety of products including tool handles, oars, garden furniture and sports equipment.  White ash is the wood used for Louisville Slugger baseball bats.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.Specific epithet means of North or South America.
","
Problems
Emerald ash borer is native to Asia.  It was first discovered in the U. S. (southeastern Michigan) in 2002.  It has now spread to a number of additional states in the northeast and upper Midwest, and is expected to continue spreading.  Emerald ash borer will typically kill an ash tree within 3-5 years after infestation.  Once infestation occurs, it is very difficult to eradicate this pest which feeds under the bark and bores into wood.  This borer now constitutes a serious threat to all species of ash in North America.  White ash trees are generally susceptible to a number of additional insect problems including ash borer, lilac borer, carpenter worm, oyster shell scale, leaf miners, fall webworms, ash sawflies and ash leaf curl aphid.  Potential disease problems include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, rust, anthracnose, cankers and ash yellows.  General ash decline is also a concern.  Brittle branches are susceptible to damage from high winds and snow/ice.
","
Garden Uses
Planting new ash trees is no longer recommended given the susceptibility of this tree to the emerald ash borer.  Ash trees have typically been used over time in a variety of applications including shade tree, street tree or lawn tree.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Fraxinus profunda, commonly called pumpkin ash, is a large deciduous tree with a narrow open crown that matures over time to 60-80’ (less frequently to 125’) tall.  Although native in scattered populations from New York to Missouri south to Florida and Louisiana, pumpkin ash is most often found growing in moist to wet locations in swamps, floodplains, wet bottomlands, river valleys and low areas, especially along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers from southern Indiana south to central Arkansas and on the southeastern coastal plain from southern Virginia to the Florida panhandle.  In Missouri, it is native to swampy lowland areas in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark).  It is often seen growing in the same areas as bald cypress, swamp cottonwood and water tupelo.  In its wettest locations, particularly in sites where standing water remains well into the growing season, the trunk of this tree becomes swollen or buttressed (often pumpkin-shaped as the common name suggests) at the base in a manner somewhat reminiscent of bald cypress (see Taxodium distichum).  Pumpkin ash features large compound leaves (to 9-18” long), each with 7-9 elliptic to lanceolate leaflets that are yellowish-green to green above and pale-hairy beneath.  Leaves turn bronze to purple red in fall.  Pumpkin ash is primarily dioecious (separate male and female trees), with ornamentally insignificant greenish male and female flowers appearing in April-May.  On female trees, fruits (winged samaras to 3” long) mature in August-October in drooping clusters.  

Fraxinus profunda and Fraxinus tomentosa are synonymous.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.

Fraxinus quadrangulata, commonly called blue ash, is native from Michigan south to Arkansas and Tennessee. In Missouri, it typically occurs in dry rocky woodlands, limestone glades and limestone bluffs in the Ozark region of the State (Steyermark).  Early Americans made a blue dye from the inner bark, hence the common name.  Corky-winged young twigs are distinctively four-sided, thus giving rise to another common name of winged ash.  This is an upland species that typically grows 50-75’ tall with a narrow, irregularly rounded crown.  Clusters of apetalous bisexual purplish flowers appear in April-May with the foliage.  Flowers give way to drooping clusters of winged samaras (to 2” long) that ripen in fall and may persist on the tree throughout winter.  Features odd-pinnate compound leaves, each with 7-11 lance-shaped, dark green leaflets (4-5” long).  Leaves turn pale and usually dull yellow in fall.  Grayish bark on mature trees separates into irregular plates. As with white ash, the wood of blue ash is commercially used for a variety of products including tool handles and furniture.Genus name is the classical Latin name for ash trees.Specific epithet means four-angled in reference to the unique four-sided twigs.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA zones 6-10.   This is a vigorous but sometimes short-lived flowering shrub/tree that grows well in dry Mediterranean-type climates.  In winter, it will tolerate temperatures down to (15 degrees F.)   Best performance occurs in sheltered positions in full sun in a dry summer climate in gravelly, poor-to-average, sharply well-drained soils.  Appreciates some light shade at the heat of the day.  Rich soils often produce excess foliage rather than better flowering.  Excellent drought tolerance.  Water sparingly.  Poorly-drained soils (such as heavy clays) and excess soil moisture (from rain or supplemental human water applications) often lead to root rot which is typically fatal.  Shrubs have shallow, wide-spreading roots.  Young plants should be staked to prevent uprooting from strong winds.  Tolerant of pruning to control size and shape.  Propagate by cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fremontodendron californicum, commonly called California flannelbush, is a fast-growing, often irregularly shaped, broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows to 8-18’ tall and to 6-10’ wide but sometimes will rise to as much as 30’ tall.  Regardless of potential height, it can be pruned regularly to 10' tall.  It is primarily native to California, where it is principally found in chaparral, open woodlands, dry slopes and foothills of 2000’ to 6500’ in elevation, with some additional scattered populations located in northern Baja California and the mountains of western and central Arizona.  In California, it appears to be most comfortable growing in the dry rocky slopes of the eastern Sierras, although it may grow slightly taller on the western slopes of the Sierras. It was reportedly discovered by explorer John C. Fremont (1813-1890) growing near Sacramento in 1846.

Key features of this shrub/tree include (a) a spectacular late spring to early summer bloom of large open saucer-shaped bright yellow flowers (to 3"" across), each containing 5 showy petal-like sepals that develop orange/rusty tints with age, (b) leathery, usually 3-lobed (but sometimes unlobed) leaves (to 4” long) which are dull green above and pubescent grayish-white below, (c) persistent, conical, post-flowering seed capsules covered with bristly rust-colored hairs, (d) the furry indumentum of stellar hairs found on leaves, stems and seed capsules is purportedly reminiscent of flannel (hence the common name of flannelbush), but physical contact with the hairs can be very irritating to the skin of some people, often causing contact dermatitis and ocular irritation.Genus name honors Major-General John Charles Fremont (1813-1890) who made four hazardous journeys exploring the Far West of the United States between 1842 and 1848.Specific epithet is in reference to the state of California being the primary native territory.
","
Problems
Root rot or crown rot diseases from too much moisture often result in premature death for this shrub.
","
Garden Uses
Sunny areas with dry soils in summer.  Accent.  Informal hedge.  Native plant gardens.  Against south-facing walls near the northern edge of its growing range.  Grow this shrub against a warm south-facing wall in the northern parts of its growing range.

Culture
In St. Louis, plants are best grown in deep, organically rich, medium moisture soils in sunny locations with some light afternoon shade. Does best in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range. Plant bulbs 6"" deep and space 9-12"" apart in fall. Bulbs should be planted sideways to prevent the stem hole in the bulb from trapping water that could cause bulb rot. Foliage dies back by early summer as the bulbs go dormant. Bulbs are large but fragile and are best left undisturbed once planted. Bulbs appreciate a good winter mulch.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fritillaria imperialis, commonly called crown imperial, is an impressive plant that grows 3-4' tall. Each bulb produces a thick, stout, upright, ramrod-straight flowering stem which rises to 4' tall. Lance-shaped green stem leaves (to 6"" long) with wavy margins appear in whorls around the lower 1/2 of the stem. Each stem is topped in spring with a crown of orange or red, drooping, bell-shaped flowers topped by a small pineapple-like tuft of leaf-like bracts. Yellow-flowered varieties are also available in commerce. All parts of the plant have a skunky odor.Genus name is from the Latin word fritillus meaning dice box in reference to the checkerboard pattern on the petals of Fritillaria meleagris.Specific epithet means imperial.
","
Problems
In addition to bulb rot mentioned above, plants are susceptible to leaf spot, rust and mosaic virus.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers sun-dappled light shade. Plant bulbs 3” deep and space 3-4” apart in fall. Needs consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Foliage should be allowed to die back naturally (by late spring) as the bulbs go dormant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Fritillaria meleagris, commonly called checkered lily, is a bulbous perennial that is native to river flood plains in Europe where it is frequently seen growing in large colonies. Plants are somewhat dainty in appearance, featuring solitary (less frequently 2-3), drooping, 2” long, bell-shaped flowers which are checkered and veined with reddish-brown, purple, white and gray atop slender stems growing to 15” tall. Blooms in April. Linear, lance-shaped, grass-like green leaves are widely-spaced on the stems. Also commonly called guinea-hen flower because of the resemblance of the mottled flower color to a guinea hen. In the right environment, it will live long and naturalize well.Genus name is from the Latin word fritillus meaning dice box in reference to the checkerboard pattern on the petals of Fritillaria meleagris.Specific epithet means spotted like a guineafowl.

Culture
Easily grown in light, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers soils that receive regular moisture, but soils must drain well. Plants perform poorly in unamended, heavy clay soils typically found in the St. Louis area. Wet soils in winter can be fatal. Tolerates dry soils and drought. Deadheading spent flowers is not necessary, but will tidy the planting and may encourage additional bloom. If flowering declines or stops in summer, consider cutting back plants to 6” to encourage a fall bloom and new basal growth that will help plants overwinter. May be planted from seed and will self-seed in optimum growing conditions if some of the flowers are not deadheaded. Plants may be short-lived.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gaillardia aestivalis, commonly known as lanceleaf blanketflower, is native from North Carolina to Kansas south to Texas and Florida. This is a perennial or annual that typically grows in clumps to 18” tall. Flowerheads (to 3” diameter) have yellow rays (sometimes with red bases) and brownish-purple disks. The flowers are distinctive because they often have only partial rays or in some cases are virtually rayless. When the rays that are present drop, the globular cones remain attractive. Long bloom period of late spring to fall. Flowers are attractive to butterflies. Lance-shaped gray-green leaves. In areas where goldfinches are present, gardeners should consider leaving some spent flowerheads for the birds. Gaillardia is sometimes commonly called blanket flower in probable reference to the resemblance of its rich and warm flower colors and patterns to blankets woven by Native Americans. However, some authorities suggest that the name blanket flower was originally derived from the habit of wild species plants to form colonies that blanket the ground. Genus name honors M. Gaillard de Charentonneau, 18th century French amateur botanist. Specific epithet comes from the Latin word for summer in reference to the bloom time. In Missouri, Steyermark originally listed G. lutea (synonymous with G. lanceolata var. flavovirens) as a rare Missouri native gaillardia having yellow disk and ray flowers. This variety was confined to only two counties in the far southeastern corner of the state. G. lanceolata var. flavovirens is now synonymous with G. aestivalis var. flavovirens.Genus name honors Gaillard de Charentonneau, a French magistrate and patron of botany.Specific epithet means pertaining to summer.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils, particularly during periods of protracted heavy summer rains. Plants are susceptible to powdery mildew, aster yellows and fungal leaf spot diseases.
","
Garden Uses
Perennial border fronts, rock gardens, cottage gardens and prairies.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers moist, organically rich soils that drain well but tolerates dry soils and drought. Performs poorly in unamended, heavy clay soils typically found in the St. Louis area. Deadheading spent flowers is not necessary, but will tidy the planting and may encourage additional bloom. If flowering declines or stops in summer, consider cutting back plants to encourage a fall bloom.‘Bijou’ is a seed strain that will self-seed in optimum growing conditions if flowers are not deadheaded.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gaillardia aristata is a species of blanket flower that is native from North Dakota to Colorado west to California and British Columbia. It typically grows in clumps to 30” tall and is found primarily in dry sites on meadows, prairies, grasslands, mountain foothills and at lower mountain elevations to 9000’. It features orange-red daisy-like flowers (to 3” diameter) with yellow tipped rays. Blooms late spring to fall. Lance-shaped gray-green leaves may be pinnately lobed near the base of the plant. Flowers are attractive to butterflies. In areas where goldfinches are present, gardeners should consider leaving some spent flowerheads for the birds. Gaillardia is sometimes commonly called blanket flower in probable reference to the resemblance of its rich and warm flower colors and patterns to blankets woven by Native Americans. However, some authorities suggest that the name blanket flower was originally derived from the habit of wild species plants to form colonies that blanket the ground. The popular but short lived gaillardia hybrid sold in commerce as G. x grandiflora are crosses between perennial G. aristata and annual G. pulchella.Genus name honors Gaillard de Charentonneau, a French magistrate and patron of botany.Specific epithet means bristly in reference to the hairs that cover the flowerhead receptacles, stems and leaves.‘Bijou’ is a dwarf seed strain that typically grows to only 10-12” tall.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Thrives in sandy soils and dry summer heat, and tolerates poor, dry soils. Sow seed directly in the garden after last frost date or start seed indoors 4-6 weeks earlier. Set seedlings out after last frost date. Space plants 12” apart. It may be difficult to find starter plants of annual gaillardias at local nurseries, since nurseries seem to primarily stock perennial gaillardias (e.g., see F. x grandiflora). Deadheading spent flowers is not necessary but will tidy the planting and may encourage additional bloom. Reseeds in optimum growing conditions if flowers are not deadheaded.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gaillardia pulchella is a hairy annual wildflower that is native to dry open places with sandy soils from Virginia to Minnesota south to Florida, Arizona and Mexico. Steyermark lists this species as a central Missouri native, but suggests that the Missouri populations may primarily be the result of garden escape. Typically grows 12-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall on upright stems that are mostly leafless at the top. Daisy-like flowerheads (to 2” diameter) feature rays in shades of red, yellow or red/yellow bicolor, with contrasting darker center disks (usually purplish). Cultivars include some double-flowered forms and expand the available flower colors to include interesting shades of orange and maroon. Blooms late spring to fall. In areas where goldfinches are present, gardeners should consider leaving some spent flowerheads for the birds. Oblong to oblanceolate gray-green leaves (to 3” long). The sometimes common name of blanket flower is in probable reference to the resemblance of the rich and warm flower colors and patterns of species flowers to blankets woven by Native Americans. However, some authorities suggest this common name was originally in reference to the habit of wild species plants to form colonies that blanketed the ground.Genus name honors Gaillard de Charentonneau, a French magistrate and patron of botany.Specific epithet means pretty.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils in part shade. Grows particularly well under deciduous trees where exposure to the sun is full in early spring but gradually changes to part shade as the trees leaf out. Giant snowdrops prefer cool climates, and are somewhat short lived when grown south of USDA Zone 7. Plant bulbs 3” deep and space 3-4” apart in fall. In optimum growing conditions, giant snowdrops naturalize well by both self-seeding and bulb offsets. Allow foliage to yellow before removing it from garden areas. If left alone, foliage disappears by late spring as bulbs go dormant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Galanthus elwesii, commonly called giant snowdrop, has larger flowers, leaves and size than the similar common snowdrop (G. nivalis). Snowdrops bloom in February-March in the St. Louis area, often poking their flower heads up through snow cover if present. The common name refers to the supposed resemblance of the flowers to drops of snow. Each bulb produces two-three narrow (to 1 1/4” wide), linear, basal leaves (to 4” long at flowering) and a leafless flower scape (to 6-10” tall) which is topped with a single, nodding, white, waxy, bell-shaped flower (to 2” long). Each flower has green markings at the base and apex. Leaves will elongate after bloom.Genus name comes from the Greek words gala meaning milk and anthos meaning flower in reference to the color of the flowers.Specific epithet honors Henry John Elwes (1846-1922), English entomologist, botanist and naturalist who reportedly introduced the plant into cultivation. Species plants are native to mountain areas of western Turkey.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Galanthus nivalis, commonly called snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial that is native to Europe and southwestern Asia. It has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of eastern North America. It is a true harbinger of spring that typically blooms from late February to late March in the St. Louis area, often poking its head up through snow cover if present. The common name refers to the supposed resemblance of the flowers to drops of snow. Each flower has six tepals (three spreading outer tepals and three shorter inner tepals).Genus name comes from the Greek words gala meaning milk and anthos meaning flower in reference to the color of the flowers.Specific epithet means snowy.

Culture
Best grown in loose, organically rich, moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Leaf mold should be worked into the soil and may also be used as a mulch. Plants need good air circulation. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Plants observed growing in the wild transplant poorly and should not be dug for use in home gardens. Once established, plants are best left undisturbed. Plants are difficult to grow from seed. Plants prefer cool summer conditions and are not recommended for growing in areas south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Galearis spectabilis, commonly called showy orchis, is a small, spring-flowering orchid of moist woodlands that is native from Quebec to Ontario south to Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and Kansas. In Missouri, it is uncommon but found throughout much of state except in the southwestern unglaciated prairies regions, in some parts of the Ozarks and in the southeast lowlands. It typically grows in rich woods in ravines and slopes and in valleys and low woods of river bottoms (Steyermark). Each plant typically rises to only 6” tall (infrequently to 10” tall) and features two broad ovate to elliptic glossy dark green basal leaves (to 6” long). In April – May, a flowering spike rises from between the two leaves bearing several (typically 3-6) two-lipped flowers in a terminal raceme. The upper hood (upper petals and sepals) is purple/rose-lavender and the lower petal is white and spurred. Flowers are mildly fragrant. The flower stem rises from a cluster of long fleshy roots. 

Synonymous with and sometimes sold as Orchis spectabilis.Specific epithet from Latin means showy.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in part shade. Prefers moist soils where it will often spread by creeping roots and self-seeding. Avoid heavy, poorly-drained soils.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Although Steyermark reports that Galium boreale subsp. septentrionale is native to Missouri in several very limited areas of the Ozark region (certain limestone ledges and bluffs in Texas and Shannon Counties), the straight species is not found in the State but is common across Canada and the northern U.S. Northern bedstraw is a somewhat weedy perennial that grows on upright, smooth stems to 1-3' tall and features tiny white flowers that appear in branched terminal and upper axillary clusters in late spring to early summer. Narrow leaves (to 2"" long and 1/2"" wide) appear along the stems in whorls of four. Although the flowers of this plant earn it consideration for a place in the landscape, northern bedstraw may be difficult to find in commerce because few nurseries other than native plant specialists seem to sell it. A more common Missouri plant which also goes by the name of bedstraw is Galium aparine which is a sprawling annual weed featuring weak bristly stems and seeds, both of which commonly stick to clothing.Genus name comes from the Greek word gala meaning milk. G. vernus can be used to curtle milk for making cheese.Specific epithet means northern.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Somewhat weedy.
","
Garden Uses
Can be useful in shady areas of woodland or shade gardens, naturalized areas or cottage gardens. May be a bit too weedy for borders.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade.  Thrives in sun dappled part shade.  Prefers organically rich loams.  Spreads in the landscape by creeping rhizomes and/or self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Galium circaezans, commonly called wild white licorice or forest bedstraw, is a somewhat weedy, herbaceous perennial or subshrub of the madder family that grows to 1-2’ tall and slowly spreads by creeping rhizomes.  It is native to mesic to dry deciduous woodlands, wooded slopes, open forested areas, thickets, and limestone glades from Quebec, Ontario, Minnesota and Nebraska south to Texas and Florida.  

This species is distinguished by (a) pubescent, lanceolate green leaves in whorls of 4, (b) tiny flowers that are sessile along the branches of each inflorescence, and (c) 3-4 greenish lobes on each flower.  

Light green, square stems are clad with leaves in whorls of 4 at intervals along the length of each stem.  Each lanceolate-ovate leaf (to 2.5” long) is medium green, sessile, sparsely pubescent, and has three prominent parallel veins.  Flowers bloom from late May into July.  Each flower (to 1/8” across) has a 4-lobed greenish-white to greenish-yellow corolla, a double-ovoid ovary, 4 stamens, and a pair of styles.  At maturity, each ovary becomes a dry, spherical, reflexed, indehiscent, one-seeded fruit that is black or dark brown and covered with hooked bristles which, among other things, stick to human clothing and animal fur in a way that helps distribute the seeds to new locations.Genus name comes from the Greek word gala meaning milk. G. vernus can be used to curtle milk for making cheese.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Circaea which is commonly known as enchanter’s nightshade and which was named after Circe of Greek mythology who reportedly used enchanter’s nightshade in her magic.Common name of wild white licorice is in reference to the sweetly flavored roots of this plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Somewhat weedy.   Susceptible to downy mildew, powdery mildew and rust.  Fungal leaf spots may appear.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Spreads by both creeping roots and self-seeding to form an attractive ground cover in moist, shady areas. Can be somewhat aggressive in optimum growing conditions. Where restraint becomes necessary, plants can be mowed with a rotary mower on a high setting. On the other hand, plants may go dormant by mid-summer if improperly grown in dry, sunny locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Galium odoratum, commonly called sweet woodruff, is a mat-forming perennial that is most often grown as a ground cover in shady areas. Plants typically grow 8-12"" tall and feature fragrant, lance-shaped, dark green leaves in whorls of 6-8 along square stems. Small, fragrant, 4-petaled, white flowers appear in loose cymes in spring. Plants emit a strong odor of freshly mown hay when foliage is crushed or cut. Aromatic intensity of the foliage increases when dried, thus dried leaves are popularly used in sachets or potpourris. Plants have also been used commercially in perfumes. Leaves are sometimes used to flavor teas and cold fruit drinks. Leaves are also used to make May wine, a punch made from white wine flavored with woodruff, orange and pineapple. Woodruff comes from Old English meaning wood that unravels, in probable reference to the creeping rootstock of the plant.Genus name comes from the Greek word gala meaning milk. G. vernus can be used to curtle milk for making cheese.Specific epithet means fragrant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in part shade in hot summer climates.  Prefers moist soils where it will often spread, albeit somewhat invasively at times, by creeping roots, self-seeding or stem-rooting where the stems touch the ground.  Avoid heavy, poorly-drained soils. Generally performs well in dry soils (rhizomes and well-branched taproots store water).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Galium verum, commonly called yellow bedstraw, is a rhizomatous, somewhat weedy perennial herb that typically grows to 8-30"" tall and to 36"" wide on erect to sprawling stems.  It is native to Eurasia and Africa, but has been introduced and has naturalized throughout much of southern Canada and northern U.S. (Newfoundland to British Columbia south to California, Kansas and North Carolina) where it is typically found in a variety of locations including dry-sandy meadows, rocky outcrops, waste areas, roadsides, banks, dunes and seashores.  In Missouri, it has been found in northern Adair County.  Fragrant bright yellow 4-petalled flowers clustered in crowded panicles bloom in summer (July-September) at the tops of wiry upright stems clad with whorls of stalkless, linear, needle-like, bristle-tipped leaves (6-8 leaves per whorl).  Flowers give way to glossy, glabrous, black schizocarps which ripen in August-September.  Additional common names for this plant include lady's bedstraw (aromatic foliage used in medieval times for stuffing mattresses) and cheese rennet (plant parts used to curdle milk for cheesemaking).  Yellow dye from flowering stems has been used as a food coloring for cheese or butter.  Red dye can be made from the roots.  Roasted seed has been used as a coffee substitute.  Plant material was reportedly used in the crib of Jesus Christ.Genus name comes from the Greek word gala meaning milk. G. vernus can be used to curtle milk for making cheese.Specific epithet means true to type or standard.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11.  May be root hardy to USDA Zone 8 (freeze to the ground in winter but return in spring).  Plants are easily grown in fertile, acidic, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Established plants have good drought tolerance (require water only in dry periods).  In the St. Louis area, plants may be grown in containers that can be overwintered indoors in a bright sun room.  Plants can also be grown as houseplants or in greenhouses.  Because of its rapid growth rate, plants may also be grown as flowering annuals by setting out small potted plants in the garden in spring after last frost date.   Propagate by seeds or cuttings.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Galphemia gracilis, commonly called,  spray-of-gold or galphemia, is a loose-growing tropical evergreen shrub that is native from Mexico to Peru.  It typically grows to 6-10’ tall in its native habitat.   If set out in the garden as an annual in the St. Louis area in spring, plants can grow 3-6’ tall in a single growing season.  Short-stalked, alternate, ovate to elliptic, light green leaves (to 2 1/2” long) have two small glands at the margins of each leaf base.  Small star-shaped yellow flowers (1/2"" long) are loosely packed into terminal racemes which cover the shrub with bloom throughout much of the year (everblooming).  Each flower has 5 sepals, 5 petals and 10 red stamens.  Flowers give way to fruits (subglobose capsules).Genus name is an anagram of the related genus Malpighia.Specific epithet means slender or graceful.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 11-12.  Acceptable growth requires rich soils in hot and humid tropical climates, abundant water (over 150"" per year), and air temperatures that do not fall below 40 degrees F. nor rise above 100 degrees F. Propagation is from fresh seed, but it takes 8-12 years before fruit first appears.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Garcinia mangostana, commonly called mangosteen, is an erect, slow-growing, tropical tree with a pyramidal crown that is native to rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia.  It produces tangerine-sized fruits called mangosteens which are considered in many circles to be the finest tasting fruits in the world.  Unfortunately this tree is very difficult to grow outside of its native habitat because of its specific and uncompromising cultural requirements.  At this time, mangosteens are primarily cultivated in Malaysia, Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines.  Attempts to grow mangosteens in Florida, California and Hawaii have been largely unsuccessful.  In its native habitat, this tree will grow to 80' tall, but in most other tropical locations it typically matures to 40-50' tall.  Large, glossy, leathery, elliptic leaves (to 20"" long) are evergreen.  Trees are dioecious (separate male and female trees), but female flowers will produce seedless fruit without pollinization.  Four-petaled female flowers  are yellow-red with a cluster of center stamens which produce no pollen.  Hermaphroditic flowers are yellow-green with red petal  margins.  Fruits (to 4"" diameter) have thick inedible rinds that mature to reddish purple.  Within each rind are 5-8 fleshy, creamy-white, usually one-seeded segments (arils) which are the edible part of the fruit.  Fruit is juicy, sweet and mildly tart.  Time of fruiting seasons will vary depending upon geographical location and growing conditions.  

National fruit of Thailand.Genus name honors Laurent Garcin (1683-1751), French botanist, who travelled widely in India.

Culture
In their native range, most gardenias are fairly adaptable shrubs tolerant of sun or semi-shade, and do best in a well-drained, humus-rich, acidic soil. Fall or spring is the best time for planting in warmer climates. Place in light to moderate shade, preferably with minimum competition from tree roots. Gardenias resent root disturbance. Use fertilizer for acid loving plants, and use iron compounds. Add plenty of organic matter, such as compost or ground bark to as large an area as possible. Mulch plants instead of cultivating. A good time to feed gardenias in these warm areas is mid-March, using an acid plant food, fish emulsion or blood meal. Fertilize the shrubs again in late June to encourage extra flowers on everbloomers or faster growth of young shrubs. Do not fertilize gardenias in the fall. Doing so will stimulate tender growth. Prune shrubs after they have finished flowering to remove straggly branches and faded flowers. Water gardenias regularly. Drip irrigating the shrubs will keep water off the foliage and blossoms and prevents leaf spots.

Cape jasmine, as it is sometimes called, is more commonly a container plant in conservatories and greenhouses in colder climates but it can be placed outside in warmer months. Grown indoors, these plants need bright light, moderate temperatures; cooler during dormancy, average to high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Water moderately, using room temperature water, when possible. Do not allow soil to dry out. Prune after flowering to maintain the plant’s shape and remove faded or brown flowers as they appear. Fertilize from March to August with a mild acid liquid fertilizer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gardenia jasminoides, commonly called common gardenia or cape jasmine, is native to southern China and Japan and is an evergreen shrub with thick, glossy, dark green leaves (to 4” long). It typically grows to 3-6’ tall.  It is particularly noted for its extremely fragrant white flowers (to 3” diameter) and is often grown in double-flowered forms.  Flowers bloom throughout the year in warm climates where temperatures do not dip below 60 degrees F., but more typically bloom in late spring to early summer in cooler climates in the northern part of its growing range.  

Gardenia jasminoides is synonymous with G. augusta and G. grandiflora.Genus name honors Alexander Garden (1730-1791), Scottish physician, botanist and zoologist who settled in Charleston, South Carolina in 1752.Specific epithet means like jasmine.
","
Problems
Problems include powdery mildew, leaf spots, dieback, anthracnose, sooty mold, whiteflies, mealybugs, scales, aphids and spider mites. These insects are often serious pests. Hard water, lack of iron or too alkaline soil will produce yellow leaves (chlorosis). The loss of buds or black leaf tips are usually due to changes in temperature or amounts of water. Temperatures below 60°F can produce malformed buds. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In the St. Louis region, gardenias are grown as pot or larger container plants. They grow well in greenhouses and conservatories, but can also thrive when placed outdoors during the summer months and returned to moderate indoor temperatures in the fall. They are prized for their large, very fragrant flowers and are quite often given as gifts to gardening enthusiasts.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it may be grown in the garden in humusy, organically rich, acidic, well-drained soils in part shade. Consider raised plantings in areas with heavy clay soil. Water plant soils consistently. Plants appreciate significant humidity year-round. In the St. Louis area, plants should be grown in pots or containers in greenhouses, conservatories or warm rooms. Plants may be taken outside in summer, but should be brought indoors in late summer/early fall for overwintering. As an indoor plant, grow this gardenia in bright light with moderate room temperatures. Water moderately, but do not allow soils to dry out. Prune as needed after flowering to shape. Fertilize as needed from March to August. Gardenias need lots of attention and are generally considered to be difficult plants to grow well.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Native to South Africa, Gardenia thunbergii, commonly called white gardenia, is a tropical/semi-tropical evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-15’ tall (smaller in containers) and features glossy, elliptic to oval, conspicuously veined, green leaves and solitary, extremely fragrant, showy, mid- to late winter flowers. Each flower (to 2.5” across) is creamy white with a tubular corolla with 8 large spreading petal-like lobes.Genus name honors Alexander Garden (1730-1791), Scottish physician, botanist and zoologist who settled in Charleston, South Carolina in 1752.Specific epithet honors Carl Thunberg (1743-1828), botanist, naturalist and pupil/friend of Linnaeus.
","
Problems
Watch for scale, white flies, aphids, mealybugs, thrips and spider mites. Powdery mildew, leaf spots, dieback, anthracnose, sooty mold and canker may occur. Leaves may yellow (chlorosis) if plant soils lose acidity. Buds may fall and/or leaf tips may blacken if temperatures or soil moisture fluctuate too much.
","
Garden Uses
In St. Louis, this gardenia is planted in large containers as a greenhouse plant or houseplant that may be taken outdoors in warm growing season months.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gaultheria procumbens, commonly called wintergreen, is a rhizomatous, creeping, woody, evergreen groundcover of the heath family that is native to woodlands in Eastern North America (Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Minnesota, Tennessee, Virginia and in the mountains to Georgia and Alabama). Erect stems clad with glossy, leathery, elliptic to oblong, dark green leaves (to 2” long) rise up from the rhizomes to 3-6” tall. Plants will spread over time to form an attractive ground cover. Waxy, nodding, bell-shaped, white flowers (3/8” long) bloom from the leaf axils in early summer (June-July). Flowers give way to edible bright red berries (3/8” diameter) that persist through winter. Leaves acquire shades of purple in fall. Leaves and fruit have the aroma and taste of wintergreen. Berries are an excellent winter food for some wildlife such as pheasant, grouse, squirrels and deer. Foliage was once used to make oil of wintergreen which has astringent, stimulant and diuretic properties. Wintergreen has been a popular flavoring for chewing gum, candies and toothpaste. Dried leaves can be used to make an interesting tea (teaberry is a sometimes-used common name for this plant), but this usage is no longer recommended. Leaves were once made into poultices for arthritic pain and sore muscles. Fruits may be eaten raw or added to pastries and salads.Genus name honors Jean-Francois Gaultier (1708-1756) who was the king’s physician in the French colony of Quebec from 1742 until 1756 plus an avid botanist and plant collector.Specific epithet refers to the plant’s low-spreading habit.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Aphids and thrips can be troublesome. Watch for mildew and leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent ground cover for shady areas. Woodland gardens, rock gardens, foundations or native plant areas. Plants are an interesting complement to other acid-loving shrubs such as azaleas, rhododendrons, kalmias and blueberries.

Culture
Best grown in sandy, loamy, well-drained soils in full sun. Good drainage is essential. A taprooted plant which tolerates heat, humidity and some drought. Remove spent flower spikes to prolong bloom period. Thin flower stems tend to become leggy and flop, particularly when grown in rich soils, and plants can benefit from close planting or support from adjacent perennials. Plants (particularly those which typically grow tall) may be cut back in late spring by 1/2 to control size. May self-seed if spent flower stems are left in place in the fall.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Gaura lindheimeri, commonly called gaura, is a herbaceous clump-forming perennial that is native to Texas and Louisiana.  It grows to as much as 5' tall on stems clad with spoon-shaped to lanceolate leaves (to 3"" long).  Pinkish buds along wiry, erect, wand-like stems open to white flowers which slowly fade to pink. Flowers appear in long, open, terminal panicles and open only a few at a time. Narrow, lance-shaped, stemless leaves (1-3"" long) are occasionally spotted with maroon.Genus name comes from the Greek gauros meaning ""superb"" in reference to the beautiful flowers.Specific epithet honors Ferdinand Jacob Lindheimer (1801-1879), Texas plant collector.
","
Problems
Root rot may occur in heavy and/or poorly drained soils.  Rust and powdery mildew may also occur.  Watch for aphids, whitefly and flea beetles.
","
Garden Uses
Effective in sunny borders. Best in groups or massed. May be grown in containers.Best in wildflower or native plant gardens where they can be allowed to sprawl and naturalize.

Culture
Gazania linearis is winter hardy to USDA Zones 5 to 9 where it is easily grown in sandy to average, well-drained soils in full sun.  Many of the other species of Gazania, including a large number of hybrids, are commonly sold in commerce today as plants that are winter hardy only to zones 9-11, and for the most part are grown in much of the U.S. as annuals.  By contrast, G. linearis and its cultivars grow well throughout Zone 5, with established plants preferring consistent moisture but being able to tolerate some soil dryness, including brief periods of drought.  Avoid soils that completely dry out in summer, wet soils, and heavy clay soils.  Deadhead spent flowers to encourage additional bloom.  Species plants are easily propagated by seed, summer cuttings or division.  Sow seed in fall or winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gazinia linearis, commonly called treasure flower, is a compact cold hardy herbaceous perennial that is native to grassy slopes and rocky cliffs in the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa.  It is a stemless flowering plant that produces a ground-hugging mat to 3-4” tall of linear to linear-lanceolate, entire to rarely pinnatifid, revolute-margined leaves (each to 4-5” long).  Leaves are shiny green and glabrous to sparsely hispid above but white tomentose beneath, and are held in basal rosettes rising from stout woody crowns.  Solitary, golden yellow, daisy-like flowers (each to 3” diameter) bloom in spring and summer on scapes rising slightly above the foliage to 5-6” tall.  In frost free climates, flowers may bloom intermittently throughout much of the year.  Ray florets are bright yellow, often with dark brown basal spots which form a showy narrow ring around the center disk of densely-packed yellow to reddish-orange disk florets. Flowers open with morning sun but close at night or on cloudy days.

Notwithstanding its attractive ornamental features, this perennial often spreads rapidly in a weed-like fashion in many areas around the world where it has been introduced.  It is now listed as an invasive species in the State of California where it has primarily escaped cultivation and naturalized in native grasslands, coastal areas, roadsides and waste places.Genus name possibly honors Theodore de Gaza (1398-1478), 15th century Greek scholar, who translated some important botanical works of Theophrastus from Greek into Latin.  In the alternative, the genus name may come from the Latin word gaza meaning ""treasure"" in reference to the attractive flowers as memorialized by the adoption of the common name of treasure flower for this plant.Specific epithet is in reference to the linear leaf of the plant.‘Colorado Gold’ primarily differs from species plants by having silvery leaf undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Overly moist soils can lead to root and stem rot.  Plants are sometimes affected by powdery mildew, bacterial leaf spot, fungal spots and crown rot.  Thrips and mealybugs occasionally appear.

Grow in sandy to average, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some soil dryness, but prefers consistent moisture. Do not overwater, however. Deadhead spent flowers to encourage additional bloom. Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. Grow as annuals in St. Louis, either in the ground or in containers. Prefers cool summer climates, and flowering may slow down considerably in hot and humid St. Louis summers. If growing from seed, start plants indoors in late winter (6-8 weeks before last frost date) and set plants outside after last frost date. Take basal offsets from favorite plants in late summer to early fall for rooting and subsequent overwintering indoors in pots. Container plants may also be brought inside for winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gazania rigens ia native to South Africa. It is commonly called gazania or treasure flower and is a popular African daisy that is similar in appearance to the genus Arctotis. G. rigens is a parent in many of the gazanias sold in commerce today. It is a tender perennial that features decumbent stems that spread along the ground. Narrow but variably-shaped, dandelion-like leaves (narrow spoon-shaped to lobed) are silvery green. Flowering stems typically rise 6-10” tall topped by solitary, daisy-like ray flowers (to 3-4” wide) with contrasting center disks. Ray flowers of this species are orange with black eyes at the bases and with orange-brown disks. Hybrid cultivars (often listed as cultivars of this species) come in a great variety of additional colors including shades of yellow, orange, bronze or white often with contrasting color at the bases forming a ring around the center disk. Can bloom summer to fall, often to first frost. Flowers close at night and may only partially open up on cloudy days.Genus name possibly honors Theodore de Gaza (1398-1478), 15th century Greek scholar, who translated some important botanical works of Theophrastus from Greek into Latin.  In the alternative, the genus name may come from the Latin word gaza meaning ""treasure"" in reference to the attractive flowers as memorialized by the adoption of the common name of treasure flower for this plant.Specific epithet means stiff or rigid.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Overly moist soils can lead to root and stem rot. Watch for leaf spot and powdery mildew. Mealybugs are occasional visitors.
","
Garden Uses
Mass in beds and borders. Containers. With its trailing stems, this species is particularly useful in hanging baskets.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but best flowering and growth occur in full sun. Plants will grow as a twining vine or if unsupported as a bushy ground cover. Plants may survive winter in the Missouri boot heel but not in St. Louis. If attempted in the St. Louis area, it should be sited in a protected location insulated from winter winds.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gelsemium sempervirens, commonly called false jasmine or false jessamine, is an evergreen twining vine that is native from Virginia to Florida west to Texas and Central America. It is typically found in open woods, thickets and along roads. Bright, fragrant, funnel-shaped, yellow flowers (to 1.5” long) appear either solitary or in clusters (cymes) in late winter to early spring (February – April depending on location). Flowers often serve as a demonstrative signal that winter is coming to an end. As a vine, false jasmine grows on wiry reddish-brown stems to 20’ long. As a bushy ground cover, it grows to 3’ tall and will sprawl somewhat indefinitely by runners. Shiny, lanceolate, light green leaves (to 1-3” long) are evergreen, but may develop yellow to purple hues in winter. Plants are semi-evergreen toward the northern limits of their growing range. Flowers and foliage are poisonous if ingested. The name of this vine is varyingly spelled as jasmine or jessamine. Carolina jessamine was named the official flower of South Carolina in 1924.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of gelsomino the Italian name for jasmine.Specific epithet means ever green.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Genista tinctoria, commonly known as dyer’s greenweed and dyer’s broom, is a low-growing, green-stemmed, deciduous shrub of the pea family that typically grows to 2-3’ tall and as wide.  It is native to meadows and pastures from Europe to Siberia.  It has been introduced into North America where it has escaped gardens and spread, sometimes invasively, in parts of Quebec, Ontario, northeastern and north central U.S. plus Virginia, Mississippi and Washington, with naturalization concentrated in coastal areas from New England to Virginia.  Shrubs feature elliptic-oblong to oblong-lanceolate, hairy-margined, rich green leaves (to 1” long).  Golden yellow pea-like flowers (each to 3/ 4” long) bloom in erect terminal racemes in June often with sporadic continued bloom extending throughout summer into September.  Flowers are followed by 8-12 seeded narrow-oblong pods.  Seeds ripen from August to October.  

A quality yellow dye can be obtained from the flowers and young shoots.  Plants grown for production of yellow dye are often grown as biennials (entire plant is dug up for harvest in the second year).Genus name comes from the Latin name planta genista from which the Plantagenet kings and queens of England took their name.Specific epithet means used in dyeing.The young shoots and stems from some of the taller plants in the genus were once bound together for use as sweeping brooms, hence the common name of dyer’s broom. 
 
Green stems plus weedy growing habit resulted in the common name of dyer’s greenweed.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Potential diseases include fungal blight, dieback, powdery mildew and rust.

Also tolerates occasional brief periods of dry soil.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gentiana acaulis, commonly known as stemless gentian or trumpet gentian, is a much-loved, dwarf, mat-forming, blue-flowered, alpine perennial that typically grows to only 4” tall but slowly forms a spreading ground cover-like carpet to 6” wide or more.  It is native to alpine grasslands, rocky meadows, screes and alpine/subalpine coniferous forest at altitudes up to 9700’ in a number of European mountain ranges including the Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, Cevennes, Cantabrians, Carpathians and Sistema Iberico.  Glossy, evergreen, elliptic to lanceolate leaves (to 1” long) grow in small basal rosettes which form a tufted carpet over time.  Showy, deep gentian-blue flowers (each to 2 1/2” long) in the shape of upward-facing trumpets bloom singly in May-June.  Flowers appear to sit directly on top of the basal foliage (flowers are stemless as indicated by the specific epithet).  Each flower has 5 sharp-pointed corolla lobes (petals) and a green-spotted throat.  This gentian is noted for its deep true blue flower color.  An image of this flower currently appears on the reverse side of the Austrian one euro cent coin.     

Some gardeners consider Gentiana acaulis to also be a group name which includes a number of different species of very short-stemmed gentians all of which feature flowers that appear to sit directly on top of the leaf clump.  Acaulis Group plants include G. alpina, G. angustifolia, G. clusii, and G. dinarica.  Acaulis Group plants primarily differ from G. acaulis in leaf shape, flower shape, and markings within the flower tube.Genus name honors King Gentius of Illyria (reign c. 180-168) B.C., who was reputed to have discovered the medicinal virtues of the root of the yellow gentian or bitterwort (G. lutea) from which a tonic bitters is still made.Specific epithet means stemless or with very short stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Gentian can be a difficult plant to grow well in gardens in the St. Louis area in large part because of the hot and humid summer conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent rock garden plant.  Alpine gardens.  Border fronts.  Sunny foundation areas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Gentiana alba is a white-flowered gentian that is native from Manitoba and Ontario south to Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky and North Carolina. In Missouri, it is found in scattered locations throughout much of the State primarily on rocky prairies, wooded slopes, ledges and bluff escarpments, rocky limestone glades and open wooded areas (Steyermark). It typically grows to 2' tall on unbranched stems clad with mostly stalkless, ovate-lanceolate, light yellowish-green leaves (to 3"" long). Five-petaled, tube-shaped, upward-facing flowers (to 1 1/2"" long) bloom in clusters of 2 to 7 at the stem tips and in the upper leaf axils from August to early October. Flowers range in color from white to greenish white to yellowish white, as reflected in the numerous common names for this plant including white gentian, white prairie gentian, cream gentian, pale gentian and yellow gentian. Flowers lack fragrance. Gentiana alba was first published by Muhlenberg in 1818. Gentiana flavida was first published by Gray in 1846. The plants are synonymous. Some experts consider G. alba to be the correct name because it was published first, but other experts consider G. flavida to be the correct name because of a belief that the Muhlenberg publication was invalid under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Genus name honors King Gentius of Illyria (reign c. 180-168) B.C., who was reputed to have discovered the medicinal virtues of the root of the yellow gentian or bitterwort (G. lutea) from which a tonic bitters is still made.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning white.

Best grown in moist, rich, cool, humusy, acidic, well-drained soils in part shade. Dislikes hot nights, and does not grow well in the deep South. If left undisturbed, plants in optimum growing conditions will naturalize over time into large clumps.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gentiana andrewsii, commonly called bottle gentian, is a Missouri native wildflower which is most often found in moist woods, thickets and low wooded areas near streams and ponds. Typically grows 1-2' tall and features tight clusters of tubular (bottle-shaped), deep blue flowers which never open. Flower clusters appear at the tops of the stems or in the upper leaf axils in late summer to early autumn (October in the St. Louis area). Ovate, lance-shaped leaves (to 4"" long) with parallel veins. Sometimes also commonly called closed gentian.Genus name honors King Gentius of Illyria (reign c. 180-168) B.C., who was reputed to have discovered the medicinal virtues of the root of the yellow gentian or bitterwort (G. lutea) from which a tonic bitters is still made.Specific epithet honors English botanical artist Henry C. Andrews (active 1794-1830).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Best grown in moist, well-draining soils in full sun to part shade. Easier to grow for the average gardener compared to other species of Gentian. Tolerant of drought and many soil types include clay. Hardy from Zones 3-7. Plants do not tolerate root disturbance, and transplanting should be avoided once established. The best time to divide large clumps is in early spring just as new growth begins.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gentiana cruciata, commonly called cross gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to forest edges, rocky pastures, grasslands, and dry meadows in Europe and western Asia. This plant slowly forms a clump about 8-12"" tall and 12-18"" wide. The lanceolate leaves (1-3"" long) are bright green, glossy, and oppositely attached to the upright stems. The truly blue, trumpet-shaped flowers emerge in a cluster tucked into the leaf axils on the upper part of the stems from late summer into fall. Attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators.Genus name honors King Gentius of Illyria (reign c. 180-168) B.C., who was reputed to have discovered the medicinal virtues of the root of the yellow gentian or bitterwort (G. lutea) from which a tonic bitters is still made.The specific epithet cruciata means ""crossed"" and refers to the shape of the leaves as viewed from above.'Blue Cross' has a generally more compact and bushy habit compared to the species, and reaches 8-10"" tall. The unopened flower buds are creamy white and intensify in color to a deep blue as they mature and open, creating a bicolor effect.
","
Problems
No major pest or disease problems reported. Deer and rabbit resistant.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful accent plant for the front of a mixed border. Also suitable for rock gardens, woodland gardens, and container plantings. Makes an excellent cut flower.

Culture
Best grown in moist, rich, well-draining, sandy loams in full sun to part shade. Requires consistent moisture and does not tolerate drought or heavy soils. Prefers slightly alkaline soils. Hardy in Zones 4-8. Tends to do poorly in areas with hot, humid summer nights. Slow-growing, may take several years to flower.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gentiana lutea, or great yellow gentian, is a large perennial herb native to the calcareous alpine meadows, moist grasslands, and open pastures of the central and southern European mountain ranges. These plants can reach 3' tall when in flower, and are typically solitary but can also grow in small clumps (1.5-2' across). Large, upright, basal leaves are lance-shaped to elliptic with deep, ribbed veins. The flowering stalk emerges in mid to late summer, with whorled clusters of yellow flowers on the axils of the upper, clasping leaves. The large taproot of this species (up to 3' long) has been used historically for medicinal purposes and as a bittering agent.Genus name honors King Gentius of Illyria (reign c. 180-168) B.C., who was reputed to have discovered the medicinal virtues of the root of the yellow gentian or bitterwort (G. lutea) from which a tonic bitters is still made.The specific epithet lutea comes from the Latin ""luteus"", meaning yellow, in reference to the coloration of the flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Gentians can be a difficult plant to grow well in St. Louis gardens in large part because of the hot and humid summer conditions.
","
Garden Uses
Moist meadows, rain gardens, rock gardens, pond edges.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils, but tolerates poor soils. Will naturalize in optimum growing conditions. Deadheading is tedious and probably unnecessary since plants usually do not repeat bloom. Foliage may yellow in hot summers if soil is allowed to dry out. Foliage may decline after flowering in hot summer climates, at which point it may be lightly sheared back and shaped to revitalize.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Geranium maculatum is a clump-forming, Missouri native, woodland perennial which typically occurs in woods, thickets and shaded roadside areas throughout the State. Forms a mound of foliage that grows to 24"" tall and 18"" wide. Features 1 1/4"" diameter, pink to lilac, saucer-shaped, upward facing, 5-petaled flowers in spring for a period of 6-7 weeks. Deeply cut, palmately 5-lobed, dark green leaves (to 6"" across). Flowers give way to distinctive, beaked seed capsules which give rise to the common name of crane's bill.Genus name comes from the Greek word geranos meaning crane in reference to the fruit which purportedly resembles the head and beak of a crane.Specific epithet means spotted.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rust and leaf spot may occur. Watch for snails and slugs.

Plants generally dislike hot and humid summers and are not recommended for growing south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Geranium pratense, commonly called meadow cranesbill, is native to northern Europe, central Asia and China.  It is a clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 24-36” tall.  Blue-purple flowers (each to 1 1/2” diameter) bloom in clusters (dense cymes) above the foliage from late spring to mid-summer.  A sparse late summer or fall rebloom may occur in some areas if plants are cut back after the primary bloom period.  Green basal leaves (3-6” wide) are deeply cut into 7-9 toothed lobes.  Flowers give way to dehiscent fruits (capsules composed of several one-seeded carpels which shatter somewhat explosively at maturity expelling seed often significant distances).  This species was introduced into North America with subsequent naturalization occurring over time in Canada from Newfoundland to Alberta and in the U.S. from Minnesota to New England south to Pennsylvania.Genus name comes from the Greek word geranos meaning crane in reference to the fruit which purportedly resembles the head and beak of a crane.Specific epithet means growing in meadows.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade.  Tolerates some drought, but produces most vigorous growth in moist, humusy soils with good drainage.  Deadheading is tedious for larger plantings and probably unnecessary.  Side stems may be removed at any time to control spread.  If not deadheaded, some self-seeding may occur in ideal growing conditions.  Foliage may be lightly sheared back and shaped to revitalize after flowering.  This is a variable plant that is noted for having better tolerance for heat in hot summers and for cold in cold winters than most other species of geranium.  Propagate by division, tip cuttings or seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Geranium sanguineum, commonly called bloody cranesbill or bloodred geranium, is an herbaceous, clump-forming perennial that typically grows in a mound to 9-12” tall with white-hairy trailing stems spreading over time to as much as 24” wide.  It is native to Europe and Asia.  It is perhaps the most common species of geranium grown in the U.S. today.  Foliage consists of small, shallowly cut, dark green basal leaves and thinner, more deeply cut stem leaves.  Solitary flowers (to 1 1/2” diameter) feature five unnotched magenta to purple crimson petals with darker veins.  Flowers primarily bloom in May and June with a sparse but variable rebloom occurring throughout summer.  After first fall frost, foliage usually turns attractive shades of red.Genus name comes from the Greek word geranos meaning crane in reference to the fruit which purportedly resembles the head and beak of a crane.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word sanguineus meaning blood red in reference to the flower color and red autumn leaves of the straight species.

Culture
Grow in average to organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Raised beds should be considered in areas with poorly-drained soils. Performs best in climates with warm summer days and cool nights. Grow as annuals in St. Louis, either in the ground or in containers. Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date. Set plants out after last frost date. Deadhead flowers to maintain plant appearance. Plants develop deep root systems, resent disturbance and can be difficult to pot up in fall for overwintering. If overwintering is desired, consider sinking pots in the garden to the rim so that pots may be taken indoors in fall. Store potted plants/containers in a cool location frost-free location with bright light but only enough moisture to prevent the soil from totally drying out. Basal offsets may be taken from favorite plants in late summer for rooting and subsequent overwintering in pots.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gerbera jamesonii is native to South Africa. Commonly called gerbera daisy, Transvaal daisy or Barberton daisy, this species is a stemless, clump-forming, tender perennial. From a basal rosette of slender, spoon-shaped, often lobed or pinnatifid, dark green leaves (to 20” long) rise naked flowering stems to 12-18” tall, each stem bearing a solitary 4” daisy-like flower. Flowers are single or semi-double. Ray flowers of the species normally come in red, yellow and orange, but numerous cultivars have expanded the colors to also include white and numerous pastel varieties. Center disks are bronze-yellow. Blooms summer to fall.Genus name honors German naturalist Traugott Gerber (d. 1743).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Overly moist soils can lead to root and stem rot. Also watch for gray mold, powdery mildew and anthracnose. Thrips, leaf miners, spider mites, aphids and whiteflies are occasional insect visitors.

Culture
Grow in moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, fertile soils in cool climates.  Needs afternoon shade in hot, humid climates.  Tends to struggle with both summer heat and humidity south of Zone 7 where it is not recommended for planting. Likes boggy and swampy conditions.  Not always reliably winter hardy in areas north of Zone 5.  Plants may be propagated by seed or division.  Deadheading spent flowers will encourage additional bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Geum rivale, commonly known as water avens, purple avens or chocolate root, is a clump-forming herbaceous perennial of the rose family that typically thrives in boggy areas including wet meadows and swamps.  It is native to Eurasia and North America (Labrador to British Columbia south to New Jersey, West Virginia, northern Illinois, Minnesota and in the mountains to New Mexico). It typically grows to 8-18” tall and features showy, nodding, bell-shaped, 5-petaled flowers (to 1/2”), 2 to 5 flowers per stem, which bloom late spring into summer (late May to early August)  and compound dark green leaves.  The brownish-purple calyx of each flower surrounds its cream to purple-pink petals.  Each pinnate leaf has 3 to 6 pairs of small, lateral, unequally-toothed leaflets (1/4 – 3/4”), with a very large terminal leaflet (1-2” diameter) which is usually over twice the size of the lateral leaflets.  Good ground cover for cool wet areas where many other plants often struggle.  Will grow well in non-boggy areas as long as soils are kept consistently moist.Genus name is the classical Latin name of the group.Specific epithet means growing by streams.If plant rhizomes are boiled in water, the resulting liquid has a faint taste of chocolate, hence the common name of chocolate root.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  May be short-lived in heavy clay soils and/or hot summer climates.
","
Garden Uses

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Geum triflorum is a North American native prairie plant. Perhaps its most distinguishing feature is not the reddish pink to purplish, nodding, globular flowers that bloom in late spring, but the fruiting heads which follow. As the flower fades and the seeds begin to form, the styles elongate (to 2"" long) to form upright, feathery gray tails which collectively resemble a plume or feather duster, all of which has given rise to a large number of regional descriptive common names for this plant such as torch flower, long-plumed purple avens, prairie smoke, lion's beard and old man's whiskers. The feathery seed tails act as sails in aiding dispersal of the seeds. A soft, hairy plant growing typically to 16"" tall with fern-like, pinnately divided, green leaves (7-19 leaflets). Spreads by rhizomes and can be naturalized to form an interesting ground cover. Native Americans once boiled the roots to produce a root tea that was used medicinally for a variety of purposes such as wound applications and sore throat treatments.Genus name is the classical Latin name of the group.Specific epithet means three-flowered.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot can be a problem in poorly drained soils, particularly in winter.
","
Garden Uses
Mass on a prairie, meadow, native plant garden or naturalized area. Also can be grown in the border front.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, peaty, moist but well-drained soils in part shade.  Also grows well in dry rocky soils.  Established plants have respectable drought tolerance.  Plants appreciate some shade during the heat of the day in hot summer climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gillenia stipulta, commonly called American ipecac or Indian physic, is a rhizomatous woodland perennial or sub-shrub of the rose family that typically grows to 2-3’ tall.  It is native to open woods, thickets and rocky slopes from New York to southern Michigan to Kansas south to Georgia and Texas.  In Missouri, it is typically found growing in acidic, dry, rocky, open woods in the northeastern, central and southern portions of the State.  It sometimes appears in large hillside colonies in the Ozarks.  

This plant features 1” wide, white (infrequently tinged pink) star-like flowers, each with 5 narrow, pointed, slightly reflexed petals.  Flowers bloom in early summer on wiry stems rising above a foliage mound consisting of deeply cut, toothed, trifoliate, medium green leaves.  Each trifoliate leaf has three linear-lanceolate leaflets (to 3.5” long), with the center leaflet being slightly larger than the lateral leaflets.  Each leaf has two unusually large stipules (leaf-like bracts) at the leaf base which give the impression of each leaf having five rather than three leaflets.  Leaves turn bronze-red in autumn.

This plant closely resembles Gillenia trifoliata, but its leaves are short-stalked, its leaflets are somewhat more deeply cut or toothed, and its large stipules at the base of each leaf persist throughout the life of the plant, whereas in G. trifoliata, the stipules drop quickly.

Synonymus with Porteranthus stipulatus.Specific epithet is in reference to the two leaf-like stipules located at the base of each trifoliate leaf.Common name of American ipecac is in reference to an old time medicinal use of the powdered roots of this plant as a laxative and emetic by Native Americans.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture soil in full sun. Prefers moist, sandy, well-drained soils. Tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, including both alkaline and acidic soils and compacted soils. Also tolerant of saline conditions, air pollution and heat. Adapts well to most urban environments.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ginkgo biloba is a large, deciduous tree that matures to 100' tall and is considered to be a living fossil. It is the only surviving member of a group of ancient plants believed to have inhabited the earth up to 150 million years ago.  It features distinctive two-lobed, somewhat leathery, fan-shaped, rich green leaves with diverging (almost parallel) veins.  Leaves turn bright  yellow in fall.  Ginkgo trees are commonly called maidenhair trees in reference to the resemblance of their fan-shaped leaves to maidenhair fern leaflets (pinnae).  Ginkgos are dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Nurseries typically sell only male trees (fruitless), because female trees produce seeds encased in fleshy, fruit-like coverings which, at maturity in autumn, are messy and emit a noxious, foul odor upon falling to the ground and splitting open.Genus name is a misrendering of the Japanese gin meaning silver and kyo meaning apricot used in Japan in the 17th century.Specific epithet means two-lobed in reference to the leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Usually slow growing, with initial growth being somewhat sparse.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent selection for a variety of uses, including lawn tree, street tree or shade tree. Also effective in city parks or near commercial buildings.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where plants are best grown in fertile, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. They tolerates some light afternoon shade. Site plants in a sheltered location protected from strong winds. Provide consistent moisture throughout the growing season, and do not allow soils to dry out. Corms are best planted in fall. Plant corms 4” deep and 4-6” apart in groups of at least 5-7. Mulch in winter with hay/straw or evergreen boughs. Plants will naturalize in the garden over time by cormlets and self-seeding. Although corms may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 7-10, it is believed by many gardeners that plants in these areas will flower best if corms are dug annually there as well. In St. Louis, corms must be lifted in fall each year prior to the first significant frost. Dig up corms, cut off stems and leaves, dry corms in a warm location, discard any diseased or damaged corms, dust with fungicide and store them in a cool but dry location (45-50 degrees F) for winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gladiolus communis subsp. byzantinus, commonly called Byzantine gladiolus, is native to the Mediterranean area. It is a bulbous perennial that features narrow sword-shaped basal leaves in a fan of 3-5 and erect flowering spikes to 24"" tall featuring flowered racemes (to 15 flowers each) of funnel-shaped, purple-magenta to maroon to copper-red flowers (each to 1-3"" long). Flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Genus name comes from the Latin word (gladius) meaning sword in reference to the leaf shape.Genus name comes from the Latin word for a small sword in allusion to the shape of the leaves. The plants are also sometimes called sword-lilies but people generally use the Latin plural gladioli.Specific epithet means common or general.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for fusarium rot, gray mold (Botrytis), aster yellows and rust. Thrips can cause significant problems. Aphids may appear. Taller flowering stems appreciate staking or support (may fall over if exposed to strong winds or rain).

Culture
In St. Louis, corms must be lifted in fall each year. Although corms may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 7-10, it is generally believed that plants in these areas will flower best if corms are dug annually there as well. Best grown in humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Adapts to a wide range of soils except heavy clay. Site plants in locations protected from strong winds. Corms may be started indoors in early spring (for earlier bloom) or planted directly in the ground after last frost date. Corm size determines planting depth and spacing. Plant corms 2-6” deep (2-3” for small corms and 5-6” for large ones) and 4-6” apart. Provide consistent moisture during the growing season, especially during dry summer periods, and do not allow soils to dry out. After bloom reduce watering. After foliage yellows and before first frost, dig up corms, cut off stems and leaves, separate cormels (small corms at the base), dry corms and cormels, discard any diseased or damaged corms and store remaining ones for winter in a dry medium in a cool, frost-free location. If fungal diseases have been a problem, consider dusting corms with a fungicide immediately prior to storage. Corms may also be planted in containers with corms stored for winter in the same manner as if they were planted in the ground.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gladiolus murielae has a large number of common names, including acidanthera, Abyssinian gladiolus, fragrant gladiolus, sword lily and peacock orchid. Synonymous with and formerly called Acidanthera bicolor, with some plants still being sold in commerce today under this name. It is native to mountain areas of East Africa. Sword-shaped medium green leaves (to 2’ long) in upright fans are typical of gladiolus. Fragrant star-shaped white flowers (to 2-3” across) with pointed spreading petals and dark purple throats are less typical of gladiolus. Flowers of this species are well-spaced and have a more graceful appearance than many of the gladiolus hybrids available in commerce. Flowers bloom in 2 to 10-flowered spikes atop scapes rising to 2-3’ tall in late summer to early fall.Genus name comes from the Latin word for a small sword in allusion to the shape of the leaves. The plants are also sometimes called sword-lilies but people generally use the Latin plural gladioli.Specific epithet honors Muriel Wilson (1906-1976) daughter of the famous plant explorer E.H. Wilson known as Chinese Wilson who introduced over a thousand plants from China.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Glandularia canadensis is commonly called rose verbena, clump verbena or rose vervain.  It is a Missouri native perennial that typically occurs in prairies, fields, pastures, rocky glades, roadsides and waste areas in the central and southern parts of the State (Steyermark).  It is a clumping, sprawling plant that grows to 6-18” tall, and can spread rather quickly by pubescent, decumbent stems, rooting at the nodes where they touch the ground, to form an attractive ground cover.  Flat-topped clusters of 5-petaled, rose-pink to rose-purple flowers appear atop ascending stems in a long, late spring to late summer bloom.  Deeply lobed dark green leaves (to 4"" long) have triangular bases.  

For many years, Glandularia canadensis was known as Verbena canadensis.   Many prestigious authorities (e.g., The Royal Horticultural Society) still list the plant as Verbena canadensis.  The revised edition of Steyermark's Flora of Missouri (Yatskievych and Turner) now lists the plant as Glandularia canadensis.  Glandularia is considered by many authorities to be a genus that is separate and distinct from Verbena based upon a number of factors including plant morphology, chromosome number, style length, reproductive modes and ploidal levels (see Umber, The Genus Glandularia (Verbenaceae) in North America, 1979).Genus name from Latin means acorn in probably reference to the shape of the seedpod.Specific epithet means of Canada.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to powdery mildew.  Botrytis blight and root rot may occur in wet soils.  Snails and slugs may attack the foliage.  Watch for spider mites, particularly in dry conditions.
","

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Also tolerant of wind, high summer heat, drought and saline conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gleditsia triacanthos, commonly called honey locust, is native from Pennsylvania to Iowa south to Georgia and Texas. It typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 120’) tall with a rounded spreading crown.  Trunk and branches have stout thorns (to 3” long) that are solitary or three-branched.  Inconspicuous, greenish yellow to greenish white flowers appear in racemes in late spring (May-June in St. Louis).  Flowers are followed by long, twisted and flattened, dark purplish-brown seedpods (to 18” long) which mature in late summer and persist well into winter.  Seedpods contain, in addition to seeds, a sweet gummy substance that gives honey locust its common name.  Species plants are generally not sold in commerce today because the thorns and seedpods are considered to be significant liabilities.Genus name honors Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch (1714-1786), director of the Botanical Garden, Berlin.Specific epithet comes from the Greek acantha meaning thorn and tri meaning three in reference to the three-branched thorns on species plants.
","
Problems
Honey locust is susceptible to a large number of potential disease problems, including leaf spot, canker, witches’ broom, powdery mildew and rust. Borers and webworms are common insect problems in some areas. Leaflets are too small to rake, which is good, but seed pods are unattractive on the tree and messy when they fall. Thorns on species plants can be just plain nasty.
","
Garden Uses
The species is not recommended for landscape usage due to its numerous thorns. Thornless/seedless varieties and cultivars are recommended for lawns and sometimes as street trees.

Culture
Plant tubers horizontally 2-4” deep and 8-12” apart in an organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil after last frost date. For earlier bloom, tubers may be started indoors in late winter and moved outside after last frost date. Best sited in locations with some afternoon shade. After bloom, dig, dry and store in a dry medium before first frost. Tubers are brittle and can be difficult to dig at the end of the growing season. Accordingly, many gardeners find it easiest to leave gloriosa tubers in pots or containers year-round: start indoors in late winter, sink entire pot to the rim into the ground after last frost date and dig up pot and remove to a frost free location after bloom for overwintering dry in the pot. Containers may also be placed on patios during growing season. As a houseplant, locate container in a bright sunny window, with watering tapered off after bloom to induce dormancy.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gloriosa superba, commonly called gloriosa lily or climbing lily, is a tropical vine which grows to 6’. Climbs by tendrils at the leaf tips. Lily-like flowers with 6 showy petal-like segments of bright red edged with bright yellow. Blooms summer to fall.Genus name comes from the Latin word gloriosus meaning glorious.Specific epithet means superb.'Rothschildiana' was named after Lionel Walter, 2nd. Baron Rothschild (1868 - 1937), who is credited with bringing the flower from Africa. When in bud, the flower faces downward but when in bloom, the petals are strongly reflexed backwards. The flowers are 4 to 5 in. wide with wavy-edged petals that are ruby red with yellow bases and edges and large, bright green stamens and pistils that spread out below the petals. It will quickly grow up a trellis using the tendrils formed at the tips of the leaves, growing from 5 to 6 ft. tall and 1 to 3 ft. wide.  It may also be known as Gloriosa rothschildiana. All parts of this plant are poisonous.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Can be difficult to grow well in St. Louis because these plants need moderate daytime temperatures (70s) and cool nights (60s) for best performance.
","
Garden Uses
Good container plant for patios. Trellis. Houseplant.

Culture
Best in loose, fertile, moist but well-drained soils in full sun. Sow seeds in spring after danger of frost has passed. Harvest beans when young (before pods turn yellow) if growing as a vegetable. Otherwise, harvest pods after they turn yellow. Soybean crops are often grown in rotation with corn as a method of fixing nitrogen in the soil (plow plants under). Glyphosate resistant varieties are available.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Glycine max, commonly called soybean, is an erect, bushy, hairy, annual legume that typically grows from 2-6’ tall. It features white to purple-pink flowers and trifoliate leaves. Flowers are small (to 1/4”) and ornamentally insignificant, somewhat resembling those of peas. Flowers bloom from mid to late summer. Fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of 3-5. Each pod contains 2-4 seeds. Soybeans today are a major global food crop (second in volume in the U.S. only to corn). They are grown mostly for their protein- and oil-rich seeds, but also for forage, cover and green manure. Additional non-food uses such as biodiesel fuel are becoming increasingly significant. Genus name comes from Greek glykys meaning sweet. This species is native to eastern Asia where it was first cultivated in China around 3000 B.C.Genus name comes from the Greek word glykys meaning sweet in allusion to the sweetness of the roots and leaves of some species.
","
Problems
Foliage is susceptible to a number of potential disease problems including bacterial blights, brown spot, anthracnose, downy mildew, powdery mildew and soybean rust. Root and stem rots, stem blights and sudden death syndrome may occur. Viruses (bean pod, tobacco ringspot and soybean mosaic) may occur. Potential insect pests include caterpillars, beatles, soybean looper, cloverworm, corn earworm, beet armyworm, stink bug and alfalfa hopper.
","
Garden Uses
Soybeans have no horticultural uses. Young beans are edible. Soybeans have a large number of food and non-food uses. The beans are an excellent source of oil and protein.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, well-drained soils in full sun. Although mature plants exhibit good drought resistance, plants grow best with regular moisture throughout the growing season. Extremely good heat tolerance. Sow seed directly in the garden after last frost date. Use ample amounts of seed since germination rate can be quite low. For earlier bloom, start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost. Most nurseries carry plants in cell/six packs. Set seedlings or purchased plants out after last frost date. Pinch young plants to promote bushiness.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gomphrena globosa, commonly called globe amaranth, is a compact annual that typically grows 12-24” tall on upright branching stems. The true flowers are insignificant, tiny, white to yellow trumpets that are only visible close up. It is the bright magenta bracts arranged in globose, papery-textured, clover-like flowerheads that provide the real show in a long summer to frost bloom. Cultivars expand the range of flowerhead colors to include red, pink, purple, lilac, violet and white. Long lasting fresh cut flower. Excellent dried flower (an everlasting) that retains color well. Narrow oblong to elliptic green leaves (to 4” long).Genus name comes from the Latin name for a kind of amaranth, possibly this one, usually grown as an ""everlasting"".Specific epithet means round or spherical.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Taller plants may need staking. Mildew may attack drought-stressed plants.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Goodyera pubescens, commonly known as downy rattlesnake plantain, is an evergreen herbaceous perennial in the orchid family that is native to dry to mesic woodlands, bluffs, wooded slopes, and wooded ravines from Quebec to Minnesota south to Oklahoma and Florida.  Distinctive, ovate, blue-green leaves (to 3” long), each with a single white center stripe and a network of white veins and cross-veins, form an evergreen, almost ground-hugging basal rosette.  A single, erect, leafless, downy/woolly flower stalk rises from the center of each rosette to 16-20” tall in summer.  Tiny, white to greenish-white, hairy, rounded flowers (to 1/4” long) with sac-like lower lips bloom from July to mid-September in a dense, cylindrical terminal raceme located on the upper quarter of each flower stalk.  Flowers are followed by fruits (small erect ovoid capsules).   

The white leaf markings purportedly resemble the skin of some rattlesnakes, the leaf rosette purportedly resembles the leaf arrangement on some unrelated plantains (Plantago spp.), and the flower stalks in particular are covered with down, hence the common name of downy rattlesnake plantain.  

The leaves were once used to make a tea which reportedly improved appetite and provided some relief for colds and kidney ailments.Genus name honors British botanist John Goodyer (1592-1664).Specific epithet from Latin means downy or hairy in regard to the downy hairs which are particularly evident on the flower stalk of this plant.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Best for shady areas of native plant gardens.  Woodland areas.  Wildflower gardens.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cotton is a staple fiber that develops in a globular pod (boll) around the seeds of cotton plants (genus Gossypium).  When ripe, the boll splits open to release the seeds which are embedded in flossy white cotton fibers.  The fibers are picked by hand or by machine (harvesters).  Cotton seed oil is obtained from crushed seed.  Most of the cotton (about 98%) that is commercially cultivated as field crops in the world today comes from two New World species:  Gossypium hirsutum, commonly known as upland cotton (90%) and Gossypium barbadense, commonly known as American Pima cotton (8%).  Gossypium tomentosum, commonly called Hawaiian cotton or Ma'o, is endemic to Hawaii (only place in the world where it currently grows), but is never commercially grown for harvest of its fibers because those fibers are very short, brown and of no commercial value.  On the other hand, Hawaiian cotton plants have good resistance to many of the common insect pests of commercially grown cotton, and, as a result, this species has been successfully crossed with commercial strains of cotton via selective breeding programs for purposes of developing varieties with better pest resistance.  Hawaiian cotton is a perennial shrub of the mallow family that typically grows in the wild to 3-6' tall spreading to as much as 7-10' wide.  It is most frequently found growing in shrubby, hot, dry coastal areas on all of the main islands in Hawaii except for Kauai and the Big Island.  It is threatened in the wild today due in large part to human encroachment and habitat destruction.  Plants feature 3- to 5-lobed, maple-like, silver green to gray-green leaves (to 5"" diameter) with palmate venation.  Bright yellow hibiscus-like flowers (to 2-3"" wide) bloom singly or in clusters of 2 or 3 from the leaf axis.  In Hawaii, flowers bloom from summer through winter.  Flowers are followed by ovoid pods (bolls) which split open when ripe to release the seeds which are embedded in brown fibers.Genus name comes from the Greek name for cotton.Specific epithet from the Latin word tomentosus meaning covered with hairs in reference to the cotton fibers.
","
Problems
In Hawaii, this plant is generally susceptible to chewing and sucking insects.   Scale, mealybugs and nematodes may appear. Watch for spider mites.  Rots, leaf spot and wilts are potential disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
In Hawaii, this shrub is sometimes ornamentally planted as an accent or hedge.   Trim plants low (e.g., to 2"") for use as a ground cover.  Xeriscape plant.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 (roots surviving in Zone 9b). Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage color usually occurs in full sun, but plants will also grow in close to full shade. Prune regularly to stimulate new foliage growth and promote bushiness. Container plants should be overwintered indoors in a bright sun room. Container plants may also be forced into dormancy by cutting back foliage and storing in a dark, cool but frost-free basement or garage for the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Graptophyllum pictum, commonly called caricature plant, is most likely native to New Guinea. It is a tropical evergreen shrub that will grow to 6-9’ tall. Container plants in the St. Louis area typically grow as rounded 2-4’ tall plants. Caricature plant is primarily grown for its variegated foliage. Oval to elliptic leaves (to 6” long) are deep green varyingly blotched with cream along the midveins. Terminal clusters (3-4” long) of red to purple-red tubular flowers with protruding stamens bloom in summer. Flowers often do not appear on container plants, particularly if stems are regularly pinched to promote new foliage growth.Genus name comes from the Greek words graptos meaning painted or marked with letters or to write and phyllon meaning a leaf from the variegated markings on the leaves.Specific epithet means painted or brightly colored.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Indoor plants are susceptible to spider mites, whiteflies and scale.
