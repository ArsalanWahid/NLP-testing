Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best flowering in full sun. Prefers moist, organically rich soils which drain well. Somewhat evergreen in the South, but generally deciduous in the St. Louis area where stems may suffer substantial damage (including dying to the ground) in cold winters. Significant stem damage can be expected when winter temperatures approach zero degrees F. Best sited in a protected location in the St. Louis area. Blooms on new wood, so prune as needed (e.g., remove stems lost to winter and, if desired, thin to the ground up to 1/3 of old stems) in late winter to early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abelia × grandiflora is a cross between A. chinensis and A. uniflora. It is a rounded, spreading, multi-stemmed shrub in the honeysuckle family. Typically grows on gracefully arching branches to 2-4' tall in the St. Louis area, but usually taller (to 6' tall ) in the warm winter climates of the South (USDA Zones 8-9). In years where the stems die to the ground in winter but the plant survives, flowering will still occur, but on smaller plants that typically reach a height of only 1-1.5'. Features clusters of white-tinged-pink, bell-shaped flowers (to 3/4"" long) which appear in the upper leaf axils and stem ends over a long and continuous late spring to fall bloom period. Flowers are fragrant. Ovate, glossy, dark green leaves (to 1.25"" long) turn purplish-bronze in autumn.Genus name honors Dr. Clarke Abel (1780-1826), physician and naturalist, who collected seed and plants as part of a British expedition to China in 1817.Specific epithet means large flowered.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Winter die-back may occur in the St. Louis area.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen or grouping or mass for shrub borders or foundations. Also effective as an informal hedge or low screen (plants tend to lose attractive graceful shape if pruned or sheared to a more formal hedge look) in southern areas where winter kill is not a concern. Mass on slopes or banks for attractive shrubby cover and erosion control.

Culture
Best grown in moist, organically rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Grows well in sandy loams.  May be grown in full sun in the northern parts of its growing range, but prefers some part afternoon shade in the southern parts (including St. Louis) of its growing range.  New foliage may scorch in full sun locations in hot summers areas, particularly if soils are not kept consistently moist.  Mulch helps retain soil moisture and keep roots cool.  Site in locations protected from strong winds.  Avoid hot and dry sites.  Fertilize in spring before leaves emerge.  Pruning is best kept to a minimum, but if needed should be done in late fall to mid winter.  Spring or summer pruning often  results in significant bleeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer palmatum, commonly called Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to 10-25' (infrequently to 40') tall.  It is native to Japan, Korea and China.  General plant form is rounded to broad-rounded, often with low branching.  Each palmate green leaf (2-5"" long) has 5 or 7 but less frequently 9 pointed toothed lobes.  Small reddish-purple flowers in umbels bloom in mid spring (April).  The flowers are rather attractive close up, but are not particularly showy from a distance.  Flowers are followed by samaras (to 3/4"" long) in pairs.  Samaras ripen in September-October.  Fall color includes shades of yellow, red-purple and bronze.  Cultivars (often grafted) are quite variable.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet is in reference to the palmate nature of the leaves. Each leaf has several lobes (typically 5–7) that all originate from one point looking like an open hand with outstretched fingers.
","
Problems
Potential disease problems include stem canker, leaf spots, fusarium, verticillium wilt, botrytis, anthracnose and root rots.  Potential insect pests include  aphids, scale, borers, bagworms, and root weevils.  Mites may be troublesome.  Foliage tends to leaf out early in spring and is subject to damage from late spring frosts.  Chlorosis may occur in high pH soils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aesculus pavia, commonly called red buckeye, is a deciduous clump-forming shrub or small tree with an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows 10-20’ tall. Showy, erect, 4-10” long panicles of red to orange-red, narrow-tubular flowers appear in spring. Palmately compound, shiny, dark green leaves are attractive in spring and early summer, but usually begin to decline by August. Smooth, light brown, globular (1-2” diameter) seed capsules encase 1-3 shiny seeds called buckeyes that ripen in the fall. Seeds are poisonous and are avoided by most wildlife. Fall foliage color is unremarkable. Red buckeye is native to southeastern Missouri where it typically occurs in low rich wooded valleys, at bluff bases, on wooded slopes and along streams (Steyermark). Flowers are attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds and bloom in St. Louis at about the same time that the hummingbirds return to the area in spring migration.Genus name is the Latin name for a kind of oak bearing edible acorns but applied by Linnaeus to this genus.Specific epithet honors 17th century Dutch botanist Peter Paaw (Petrus Pavius).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Abelia chinensis, commonly known as Chinese abelia, is an upright-rounded, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub of the honeysuckle family that typically grows on arching branches to 5-8’ tall and to 3-5’ wide.  This is an outstanding flowering shrub whose main claim to fame is a lengthy early summer to fall bloom of very fragrant tubular white flowers with showy soft pink bracts.  Flowers may be the most fragrant found on any species of Abelia. This shrub is native to lower alpine areas up to about 6000’ in elevation in southeastern China.  Branchlets are covered with soft reddish wooly hairs when young.  Mature branches are grayish brown.  Toothed ovate leaves (to 1 1/2” long) are sparsely hairy above.  White flowers (each to 1/2” long) bloom in axillary and terminal clusters at the stem ends.  Weight of the flowers often causes the stem ends to dip, thus giving the shrub a somewhat weeping appearance during peak bloom season.  As the flowers finish bloom, the sepals turn from green to a showy rosy mauve and persist on the shrub with retention of that color until November.  From a distance, the shrub appears to be in bloom well into fall even though the flowers are long gone.  This shrub is well-known for being attractive to butterflies (adults butterflies seek flower nectar and caterpillars feed on the foliage). 

Chinese abelia is a parent of the popular A. x grandiflora hybrids.Genus name honors Dr. Clarke Abel (1780-1826), physician and naturalist, who collected seed and plants as part of a British expedition to China in 1817.Specific epithet is in reference to this species being native to China.

Culture
Reliably winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10.  Best growth occurs in a sandy/gritty, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade.  Sharp soil drainage is important.  Poorly-drained soils inevitably lead to root rot.  Tolerates dry soils and drought.   Surprisingly good winter hardiness for this succulent.  Plants have reportedly survived winters with temperatures as low as -20F (USDA Zone 5), but cold temperatures should be ""dry cold"" as opposed to ""wet cold"".
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave parryi, often called Parry's agave or mescal, is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to grasslands, chaparral, desert scrub, pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands in Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico typically at elevations from 4,000 to 8,000 feet.  It is most noted for its attractive blue-gray to gray-green evergreen leaves, but is also noted for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Thick, rigid, smooth, ovate to oblong, blue-gray leaves (to 12” long) form a large, dense, symmetrical, basal rosette.  A rosette will typically mature over time to 2' tall by 3' wide.  Each leaf has spiny margins with a one inch terminal spine.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes.  Each rosette will flower only once, usually at some point between 10-15 years (not the 100 years suggested by the also-used common name of century plant used for some agaves), but sometimes flowering will not occur until 20-30 years.  One huge flowering stalk (to 20' tall) will rise from each rosette, with each stalk producing 20 to 30 side branches and with each side branch containing a large cluster of creamy yellow flowers.  In its native habitat, flowers typically bloom in summer (June - August).  Flowers are followed by seed pods.  The flowering rosette dies after flowering, but new rosettes formed by suckers/offsets from the base of the mother plant will remain.  Native Americans used this agave as a source of food, fiber, soap and medicine. Plant liquids may be fermented to form an alcoholic beverage called pulque which may be further distilled to form mescal or tequila.  

Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable in probable reference to the flower spikes.  

Specific epithet honors Charles C. Parry (1823-1890), physician-botanist-plant collector.
","
Problems
Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aloe vera, commonly called medicinal aloe, is a stoloniferous, stemless, tropical perennial that grows upright with stiff rosettes of succulent leaves. Common name is in reference to the folk medicine history of this plant which goes back to the pre-Christian era. Lance-shaped green leaves (to 18” long) are spotted white and armed with whitish marginal teeth. Leaves mature to gray-green. Plants may grow to as much as 3’ tall. Flowering occurs only on mature plants, typically in summer. On container plants, flowering will only occur on plants grown in optimum conditions (e.g., sunny windows or sunny outdoor locations). Yellow flowers in racemes bloom atop erect stalks rising to as much as 3’ tall. Medicinal aloe is noted for the healing and cosmetic properties attributed to its sap. The sap is added to a large number of commercial cosmetics, particularly lotions and creams. Sap is noted for its ability to moisten dry skin. Sap from a broken leaf may be applied directly to burns on the skin for relief. Sap should not be eaten, but has been used in the past for treating peptic ulcers. The sap also reportedly has strong laxative properties. Medicinal aloe is also commonly called burn plant or burn aloe. Synonymous with and formerly known as Aloe barbadensis.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anisacanthus quadrifidus var. wrightii, commonly called Texas firecracker, is an upright, deciduous shrub reaching up to 5' tall and 4' wide with an informal, spreading appearance. It is native to extreme south-central Texas and adjacent northern Mexico, where it is found growing on rocky, calcareous slopes and floodplains. The slender, brittle stems have attractive, peeling bark. The leaves are small, nearly clasping, and lanceolate in shape. Bright red-orange tubular flowers (1-1.5"" long) appear in abundance during bloom periods, which most often fall from spring to late summer after rain. Extremely attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators. Deer tend to avoid this plant.The specific epithet quadrifidus means ""divided into four"", possibly in reference to the four symmetrical petals of the flowers. The infraspecific epithet wrightii honors Charles Wright (1811-1885), an American botanist who chiefly collected  in Texas, Hong Kong, and Cuba.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11.  Plants can be grown outdoors year round as long as temperatures never dip below 20-25 degrees F.  Plants perform best in organically rich, consistently moist but well drained soils in part shade (bright indirect light or filtered sun).  Avoid direct hot afternoon sun which may cause the leaves to yellow.  Tolerates full shade, but foliage may turn a lighter green.  Plants may die to the ground in light freezes, but roots remain hardy to about 20-25 degrees F.  North of Zone 9, plants can be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors.  Asparagus fern is easily grown as a houseplant in the St. Louis area because it tolerates a wide range of temperatures, does not require high humidity and is easily pruned.  It is best grown with a well-drained, peaty potting mixture.  Water regularly from spring to autumn.  It does not require winter dormancy, but appreciates a resting period with reduced watering over the winter months.  Performs well with regular temperatures in summer and minimum 50F temperatures in winter.  This plant is often taken outside for the growing season and brought back inside in early fall.  Pinch back stem tips as needed to maintain plant form and promote dense foliage growth.  If plant loses its attractive shape, stems may be cut back close to the soil level to regenerate.  Propagate by seed or division (separate tubers).  Birds eat the berries and help spread the seed to new locations where the seed will often readily sprout.  Self-seeding can be mildly invasive in some subtropical to tropical areas (e.g., southern Florida and Hawaii).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asparagus densiflorus, commonly called asparagus fern, is noted for its dense fern-like foliage which forms an arching mound that matures to 1-3’ tall spreading to 3-4’ wide.  It is not a fern, however, but is a member of the asparagus family. It is native primarily to coastal areas in the southeastern part of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.  It has escaped cultivation and naturalized in southern Florida where it has spread in a mildly invasive fashion.  This ornamental asparagus is an evergreen perennial with outward-sprawling fibrous and tuberous roots from which rise numerous semi-stiff arching stems (to 24” long) covered with linear, needle-like green leaves (.75 to 1” long).  Technically, the stems contain true leaves (tiny, inconspicuous and scale-like) and larger leaf-like phylloclades which have the form and function of leaves.  Tiny, inconspicuous, pea-like, fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.  Flowers are followed by small red berries which ripen by fall.  Plants have thorns, but the thorns are so small as to be often not noticed. This plant is also sometimes listed as Protasparagus densiflorus because plants in the genus Asparagus (e.g., the edible vegetable A. officinalis) have rhizomes but this plant does not.  Species plants are not as widely grown in gardens as are certain popular cultivars such as ‘Myersii’ (foxtail fern) and Sprengeri group (emerald fern).Genus name is the classical name of this plant.Specific epithet is in reference to the dense flowers along the stem and/or to the dense foliage.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bignonia capreolata, known as cross-vine, is a vigorous, woody vine that climbs by branched tendrils with adhesive disks.  It is grown primarily for its attractive flowers and its ability to rapidly cover structures with attractive foliage.  Opposite, compound leaves are bifoliate.  Each leaf consists of a pair of lanceolate to oblong dark green leaflets (to 6” long) and a branched tendril between them.  Tendril branches terminate in adhesive disks that easily attach to walls.  Foliage remains evergreen in the South, but turns reddish-purple in fall with subsequent leaf drop in the colder winter areas of its range.  Axillary clusters (2-5 flowered cymes) of fragrant, trumpet-shaped, orange-red flowers (to 2” long) appear in spring.  Flowers are followed by greenish, pod-like seed capsules (to 7” long) which mature in late summer and persist into fall.  

This vine is in the same family as and closely related to Campsis radicans which is commonly known as trumpet vine.Genus name honors of Abbe Jean Paul Bignon (1662-1743), Librarian to Louis XIV.Specific epithet means having tendrils.A cross section of stem reveals a marking resembling the Greek cross, hence the common name.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buchloe dactyloides, known as buffalo grass, is a dioecious, drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, fine-textured, warm season perennial grass that is native primarily to the Great Plains within the area from Minnesota to Montana south to Louisiana and Arizona.  It is one of the dominant grasses of the shortgrass prairie. It is commonly called buffalo grass because it was at one time regularly grazed by herds of buffalo (American bison) that once populated the Great Plains.  It typically grows 4-8” tall  with gray-green curly leaves.  It spreads by stolons.  Somewhat inconspicuous green flowers bloom in summer (June -August), with male flowers appearing in comb-like spikes on slender stems rising above the leaves and with female flowers appearing in bur-like clusters on short stems hidden by the leaves.  Buffalo grass is considered to be an excellent native forage grass.  With the addition of new cultivars, buffalo grass is now becoming more popular as a low-maintenance turfgrass for lawns, parks, golf courses, roadsides and commercial areas.  In optimum growing conditions, it can form a low maintenance turf which survives hot and humid summers with minimal water and fertilizer.  The main disadvantages of buffalo grass as a lawn turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to mid-spring when grass is dormant, (2) invasive habit which may result in stoloniferous spread into adjacent plantings, and (3) intolerance of heavy foot traffic.Specific epithet means resembling fingers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Chinch bug can be troublesome.  Brown patch, summer patch and leaf spot may occur.  Stolons may spread into adjacent areas.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Becomes weedy and sparse with diminished flowering performance in too much shade, however. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions including poor, somewhat dry soils, but is intolerant of wet conditions. Winter hardy to USDA Zone 5 where it usually does not suffer any significant winter die-back. Unlike Buddleja davidii, this species blooms on the previous year's wood, so cutting plants to the ground in late winter each year is not an option. Prune in late spring immediately after flowering. Weeping habit may be best showcased by training and growing this plant as a single trunk tree.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buddleja alternifolia is a deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub or small single trunk tree which typically grows 8-15' tall (infrequently to 20' as a tree) with arching, drooping, willow-like branches. Tree form may superficially resemble a small weeping willow. Short clusters (to 3/4"" long) of lightly fragrant, lilac-purple flowers bloom in the leaf axils along the previous year's stems in spring. Flowers earlier than most other species of butterfly bush. Lance-shaped leaves (to 4"" long) are green above and grayish below. Unlike other cultivated species of Buddleja, this species has alternate leaves, hence the species and common names. Also sometimes commonly called fountain buddleia in reference to the growing habit. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name honors the Reverend Adam Buddle (1660-1715), English botanist and vicar of Farmbridge in Essex.

The genus name is frequently listed today as Buddleia.  However, Linnaeus named the genus Buddleja (pronounced with a silent “j”) which is still considered to be the proper spelling (first name survives) according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Specific epithet refers to the alternate leaves of the species.Common name also refers to the alternate leaves of the species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Shrub borders, foundation plantings, cottage gardens or butterfly gardens. Interesting weeping specimen when trained as a single trunk tree.

Culture
Best grown in evenly moist, well-drained loams (sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade.  Plants will grow well in a variety of part-shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun.  Plants can grow in close to full shade, but typically are less vigorous and more open with decreased foliage density.  When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to scorch, bronze in winter or suffer from mite attacks.  Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline. Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing as needed.  Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date.  Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost.  Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots.  Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2”).  Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation.  This boxwood is best sited in locations sheltered from strong winds and full day winter sun.  Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing.   Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations from plants as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.   Plants may be propagated by cuttings.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus sempervirens is a rounded to broad-rounded shrub or small tree that is native primarily to open woodlands and rocky hillsides in southern Europe, northern Africa and western Asia.  It typically matures in a shrubby form to 5-15' tall, but may grow as a tree to as much as 20-30' tall.  Small, elliptic to oval to oblong leaves (1/2"" to 1 1/2"" long) are simple, opposite, smooth-margined and evergreen.  Leaves are dark glossy green above and yellowish-green below.  Inconspicuous, apetalous flowers in axillary clusters are pale green to yellow to creamy white. Flowers appear in April and May. Fruit is a dehiscent capsule (to 1/3"" long) that matures to brown.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Specific epithet means always green in obvious reference to the evergreen foliage.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood to make boxes.  Another theory on common name is that the name is in reference to young plant stems which are quadrangular (square box cross section).
","
Problems
Boxwood can be somewhat temperamental to grow in the St. Louis area where its evergreen foliage tends to bronze (turn unattractive brownish-yellow) in harsh winters, particularly if plants are located in open areas exposed to full sun and winter winds.  Otherwise, boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning.  Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot.  Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils.  The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid.  In the deep South,  nematodes are of concern.  New growth is particularly susceptible to winter damage.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, humusy, organically rich, acidic soils in part shade or filtered sun. Does well in bright shade. Avoid direct sun where leaves will scorch. Tubers may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, however, tubers should be started indoors in early spring, planted outside directly in the ground or in containers after threat of frost has past, dug up in fall immediately after foliage die back/first frost and then overwintered in a dry location (set in dry peat or wood shavings) where temperatures do not dip below 45 degrees F, in somewhat the same manner as done for tuberous begonias. Container plants may be stored indoors in the containers. When growing plants in garden soils, provide regular moisture, especially during dry summer periods, and do not allow soils to dry out. Plants also appreciate regular fertilization. St. Louis summer temperatures are ideal for caladiums: hot and humid with nighttime temperatures rarely dipping below 60 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caladium bicolor, commonly called caladiums or angel wings, are arum family members that are grown exclusively for their bold and colorful foliage. Calla-type flowers, if present, are usually hidden.

Culture
This native plant prefers the soil of its natural forest floor habitat - a moist clay or sand enriched with organic matter. It will fruit most abundantly in full sun but may be grown in light shade. The plant needs minimal care once its roots are established. Since Missouri is at the northern edge of beautyberry's range, the foliage will be killed back to the ground in most winters. This will not affect the flowering as the plant blooms on new growth. In warmer areas, this shrub may be pruned back to about 2' less than the desired size. Propagate by cuttings or from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Callicarpa americana, commonly called beautyberry, is a loose open shrub valued for its spectacular fruits. The relatively insignificant flowers develop into prolific bright violet to magenta berry-like drupes which encircle the stem. These fruits remain attractive for a long time although they are generally gone before severe winter weather.Genus name comes from Greek meaning beautiful fruit.Specific epithet means of the Americas.
","
Problems
Beautyberry is relatively disease and pest free.
","
Garden Uses
The size and loose open habit of beautyberry makes it best for the back of a shrub border where it may be massed in large landscapes or where it may be naturalized. Beautyberry plants are said to bear more fruit if several are planted together.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex tumulicola, sometimes commonly called foothill sedge or Berkeley sedge, is an evergreen perennial sedge that grows in arching clumps to 1-2' tall.  It is native to open woods, meadows and coastal prairies from the central coast of California north to Oregon and Washington.  Plants feature pubescent, narrow, grass-like, medium green leaves (to 18"" long and 1/8"" wide).   Brown, non-showy flowers bloom in spring atop stems rising above the foliage to 2' tall.  

Carex divulsa is a European species of Carex which at one point was sold in California by mistake as Carex tumulicola.  It differs inter alia from the California native by being a more aggressive spreader with winter hardiness to USDA Zone 4.

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf spot, smut and rust are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this evergreen sedge will form an impressive ground cover which is not only ornamentally attractive but also helps stabilize soils and control erosion.  Flowers are somewhat insignificant.  Group or mass.  Also effective accent for borders or smaller gardens.  Can be mowed and used as a lawn substitute, particularly for difficult areas of the landscape.  True beauty of this sedge is in its evergreen foliage.  Birds are attracted to the plant's seed.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chasmanthium latifolium, a clump-forming, upright, ornamental grass, is a Missouri native plant which typically grows 2-5' and most often occurs in rich woods or rocky slopes along streams and on moist bluffs. This grass is perhaps most distinguished by the flat, drooping seed heads which hang in terminal clusters on thread-like pedicils from slightly arching stems. Seed heads will flutter when caressed by even the softest of breezes. Seed heads emerge green but turn purplish bronze by late summer. Bright green leaves (5-9"" long) turn a coppery color after frost and eventually brown by winter. Excellent for dried flower arrangements. Common name of inland sea oats is in reference to the similarity of the seed heads to those of oats. This grass was once known as Uniola latifolia.Genus name comes from the Greek chasme meaning gaping and anthemum meaning flower for the form of the flower.Specific epithet means broad-leaved.

Mature plants will reach up to 30' tall with a 20' spread. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, reaching up to 10"" long and only 0.25"" wide. White to rose-pink blooms (up to 1.5"" long) with ruffled petals appear on terminal panicles from May to June, but will sporadically rebloom throughout the summer particularly after rain. The fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers are highly attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other insect pollinators.Genus name comes from the Greek words cheilos meaning lip and opsis meaning resembling in reference to the distinct lip found on its calyx.The specific epithet linearis means ""linear"" and refers to the shape of the foliage.The common name desert willow refers to the resemblance of this plant to many willows (genus Salix), but it is more closely related to catalpa (genus Catalpa) and trumpetcreeper (genus Campsis).LUCRETIA HAMILTON is a compact selection that reaches a maximum height and spread of around 18'. The blooms are a bright fuchsia with light pink to white interiors. Its name honors Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton (1908-1986), an American botanist and botanical illustrator whose work focused primarily on the flora of the southwestern United States.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small citrus tree will grow well in sandy, neutral, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. It has the best winter hardiness of any of the lemon-type fruits. Best performance occurs in full sun. Provide consistent and regular watering. Avoid wet poorly drained soils. When grown outside, this tree will bear fruit year around in warm temperatures, however it may slip into dormancy if winter temperatures dip significantly below 55F. It will tolerate brief temperatures around 32 F., but generally does not tolerate frost. This plant thrives in climates where daily temperatures range from low 70s F. in the daytime to high 50s F. at night. Elsewhere it may be grown in containers as a houseplant. Use an all purpose potting mix. Set container outdoors in late spring in full sun in a location protected from wind. Bring pot indoors in fall for overwintering in a bright sunny southern window. Mist plants with water almost daily in winter. Indoor plants usually fruit in spring. Hand pollination may be needed for indoor plants due to the lack of insects. New plants may be easily grown from cuttings.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus, x meyeri, commonly called Meyer’s lemon, is native to China. It was introduced into the U.S. by Frank Meyer who reportedly found the plant in 1908 near Peking, China. It is believed to be a hybrid cross of Citrus limon (lemon) and Citrus reticulata (mandarin orange). It is less acidic, juicier and sweeter than common lemons. Trees typically grow to 6-10’ tall. Shiny dark green leaves are evergreen. Waxy, fragrant, white flowers appear year around in warm climates. Large rounded yellow fruit (to 3” diameter) with smooth, thin skin lacks the rough texture and pronounced nipple of the true lemon. Original Meyer lemon trees were symptomless carriers of a virus (tristeza) that killed other citrus family trees. Those original trees were mostly destroyed and replaced with a virus-free variety that today is referred to as improved Meyer lemon. Not much commercial growth of this fruit is done because the fruits are thin skinned and ship poorly.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet honors Frank Meyer.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In its native habitat, it tolerates a wide range of soils from boggy conditions to dry ones. In cultivation, it is best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. In St. Louis, it must be grown in containers which can be placed outside on patios in summer or grown indoors year-round as houseplants. Keep container soils consistently moist in summer but reduce moisture indoors in winter. Container patio plants should be overwintered in bright sunny spots in the home or in greenhouses. This plant develops a taproot which needs the root space of a large and deep container for best growth.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cordyline australis, commonly called giant dracaena or cabbage palm, is one of the best known and most recognized of the plants indigenous to New Zealand where it typically grows as a single or multiple-trunked tree to 20-30’ tall. It was introduced into the U.S in the early 1800s and now grows in a number of locations in California and the southern U.S. It features sword-shaped gray-green leaves to 3’ long and only 2-3” wide. Impressive panicles of small fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, however container-grown plants rarely flower. Young plants feature a fountain of grass-like leaves with no trunk and are often sold in this form as houseplants. Patio container plants will slowly develop a cane-like trunk or trunks over time, eventually growing to as much as 15’ tall.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cordyline fruticosa, commonly called Ti plant, typically grows as a short tree or shrub to 10’ tall in its native habitat of tropical Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and some Pacific islands including Hawaii. In the United States, it can only be grown outdoors in far southern Florida, southwestern United States and Hawaii. As a houseplant in the St. Louis area, it more often grows a 3-6’ tall. This is a long-lived broadleaf evergreen that features thin lance shaped leaves (to 30” long and 6” wide) that emerge pinkish red, but mature to deep green. Scented, white to pale lavender flowers appear in panicles (to 12” long) in summer and are followed by red berries. Houseplants rarely flower and fruit, however. As the plant ages, it loses its lower leaves. Leaves of this plant have been used in Hawaii to make hula skirts and edible rhizomes for food.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coreopsis grandiflora, commonly called large-flowered tickseed, is native to prairies, glades, open woods, thickets, roadsides and open ground in the southeastern U.S. from Florida to Texas and New Mexico north to Georgia, Missouri and Kansas.  It typically grows in a clump to 2' tall.  Daisy-like single flowers (2-3"" diameter) feature deep yellow rays (notched at the tips) surrounding a darker golden yellow center disk.  Flowers appear singly atop slender, erect stems rising to 2' tall.  Flowers typically bloom from late spring to late summer and sometimes into fall, though bloom period can be much shorter if spent flowers are not regularly deadheaded.   Upper leaves are pinnatifid and deeply lobed, but lower leaves at the base of the plant are lobeless and linear.  Through introduction and garden escapes, this coreopsis has become established in the eastern and central U.S. well north of its native range.The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning bug and opsis meaning like in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet means large-flowered.Common name of tickseed is in reference to the resemblance of the seeds to ticks.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Unlike other species of Coreopsis, C. rosea and its cultivars have very little drought tolerance and need consistently moist soils in order to thrive. Avoid poorly-drained heavy clay soils, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flower stalks can be tedious for a large planting, but does tend to encourage additional bloom and prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Plants may be sheared in late summer to promote a fall rebloom and to tidy the planting (stems often become matted as summer progresses). In optimum growing conditions, plants will spread in the garden by rhizomes and self-seeding to form a dense ground cover, sometimes to the point of being considered aggressive.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Light afternoon shade helps avoid possible sun scald in hot summer climates. Best growth occurs in cool and dry summer climates. Plants dislike areas with high humidity and frequent rain. Seeds may be planted directly in garden soil after the last spring frost date. They may also be planted in pots. Plants grow rapidly (pinching off young leaves can begin in 30 days). Snip off flower stems before flowering to prolong harvest of leaves. Plant new seed every 2 weeks to insure a continuous crop of leaves. Allow some plants to flower and seed if harvest of coriander seed is desired. Seeds are ready for harvest in 90 days. Plants tend to bolt easily (abandon leaf growth, flower, seed and die) in hot summer climates. A late summer planting of seed can be done for fall harvest of leaves but seed will not mature before frost. Plants are annuals but have naturalized in some parts of North America.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Coriandrum sativum is a warm weather annual that is commonly grown in herb gardens for its lacy, strong-scented foliage (cilantro) and its aromatic seeds (coriander). It is native to southern Europe and the western Mediterranean. It typically grows in a basal clump to 24"" tall and to 18"" wide. Plants may sprawl in the garden. Finely-divided upper leaves are fern-like. Broad-lobed lower leaves resemble those of Italian parsley. Cilantro leaves are used for flavoring a number of food dishes including salads, salsas, meats, sauces and soups. Leaves are best used fresh, but may be frozen in ice cube trays for later use. Stems are also edible when young. Coriander seeds ripen in round, yellow-brown pods. Seeds are typically ready for harvest about 90 days after seed is planted (late summer to early autumn in St. Louis). Mature seeds have a pleasantly sweet-spicy fragrance and are used for flavoring sauces, meats, sausages, stews, chutneys, pies and cakes. Seeds are an ingredient found in curry powder. By contrast, young seeds are never used for culinary purposes because they have an unpleasant fragrance and bitter taste. White to pink to pale lavender flowers bloom above the foliage clump in loose compound umbels (to 2"" across). Swallowtail butterflies feed on plant leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek name koriandron from koris referring to the unpleasant smell of the unripe fruits which disappears when they are ripe and dry.Specific epithet means cultivated.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia galanga, commonly known as Siamese ginger, Thai ginger or galangal, is a tropical evergreen perennial with a thick aromatic rhizome.  It is native to Southeast Asia.  For culinary use, the rhizome is typically cut up into small pieces, thin-sliced, pounded into a paste, or dried and powdered for inclusion as a flavoring in a variety of food dishes such as soups and curries.  It is reportedly one of the most frequently used spices in Thai cooking, and is also quite popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.  Indonesian rendang is usually flavored with this rhizome.  Each plant typically grows to 6' tall in a clump of stalks clad with long green leaves (12-15"" long by 2-3"" wide).  Showy yellowish-white flowers with red centers bloom throughout the year on upright inflorescences.  Flowers are followed by red fruits (1/2"" diameter) which emerge green and then turn yellow before finally maturing to red.  Leaves, stalks, rhizomes and seeds all have a mild aromatic aroma.  Foliage is attractive and plants may be grown ornamentally without harvesting the rhizome.  Plants are evergreen when grown in frost-free locations.  In Southern Asia, fresh rhizomes are commonly sold in markets.  Rhizomes also have certain folk medicinal uses in Asia.  In the U.S., rhizomes are generally available for purchase in most Asian groceries.

Cotinus coggygria, commonly known as smoketree, is an upright, loose-spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub that is native from southern Europe to central China.  It typically matures over time to 10-15’ tall and as wide.  It gets its common name of smoketree (or smokebush) not from the tiny, insignificant, yellowish flowers which appear in branching, terminal panicles (to 6-8” long) in spring, but from the billowy hairs (attached to elongated stalks on the spent flower clusters) which turn a smokey pink to purplish pink in summer, thus covering the tree with fluffy, hazy, smoke-like puffs throughout summer.  Bluish green leaves (to 3” long) are ovate to obovate.  Fall color is highly variable, but at its best produces attractive shades of yellow, orange, and purplish-red.Genus name comes from the Greek word kotinus meaning olive.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word kokkugia meaning smoke tree.

When grown as a turfgrass, mow regularly to a height of 3/4"" to 1.5"" tall, fertilize during the growing season (May to August) and use soil barriers to prevent spread into adjacent areas. Sometimes overseeded with rye. Bermuda grass has winter hardiness problems in the Midwest Transition Area, however, and is not recommended as a turfgrass for St. Louis. Some winter kill is to be expected when winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F. Needs regular dethatching. It is not recommended as a turfgrass for lawns in the St. Louis area.'Sundevil' is considered even less winter hardy than the species.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynodon dactylon, commonly called Bermuda grass or wire grass, is a tough, warm season grass which spreads rapidly by both stolons and rhizomes. In optimum conditions, it will form a dense lawn which tolerates foot traffic well and excludes many common weeds. On the other hand, many homeowners consider it to be a noxious weed and expend considerable energy trying to eradicate it from their lawns and garden areas. The main disadvantages of Bermuda grass as a turfgrass are (1) foliage turns straw-colored from mid-fall to late spring when grass goes dormant and (2) highly aggressive habit which results in spread into adjacent plantings such as flower beds, vegetable garden and borders.Genus name comes from the Greek words kyon meaning a dog and odous meaning a tooth.'Sundevil' is a coarse, seeded turfgrass variety which features light green blades.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. White grubs are the most common insect problem. Additional insects of concern include sod webworms, cutworms, armyworms, nematodes and mole crickets.

Cyrtomium falcatum, commonly called Japanese holly fern, is native to eastern Asia, India, southern Africa and Hawaii. The fronds of this fern resemble holly branches. This is an evergreen fern (deciduous in St. Louis) that typically grows in a dense, vase-shaped clump to 2’ tall. Arching, glossy, dark green fronds (1-2.5’ long) are noted for their thick, leathery pinnae, which are falcate (sickle-shaped) as the species name suggests. Spores are easily carried by wind, and species plants have escaped gardens and naturalized in certain areas of the southeastern U.S.Genus name comes from the Greek kyrtos meaning arched in reference to the fern habit.Specific epithet means sickle-shaped.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Eupatorium perfoliatum, commonly called boneset, is a large, hairy, clump-forming, Missouri native perennial which typically occurs in wet soils in low woods, thickets, stream banks, meadows and prairies throughout the State. Flat-topped clusters (compound corymbs) of small, fluffy, white flowers appear above the foliage in late summer to fall. Perfoliate foliage is quite distinctive: the bases of the pairs of wrinkled, opposite, lance-shaped, medium green leaves unite to surround the hairy stems (perfoliatum meaning through the foliage). Historically, boneset was commonly included in medical herb gardens and used as a folk medicine for treatment of flus, fevers, colds and a variety of other maladies. Though some authorities claim the name boneset refers to a former use of the plant to aid the healing process for broken bones, others claim that the name is in reference to the plant's use as a diaphoretic in the treatment of an 18th century influenza called break bone fever. All parts of the plant are quite toxic and bitter. Also commonly called thoroughwort.Genus name comes from the Greek name for these herbaceous and shrubby plants in honor of Mithridates VI Eupator, 132-63 B.C., King of Pontus, who reportedly discovered the medicinal uses for some Eupatorium species plants.Specific epithet means perfoliate, having leaf bases that encircle the node, so that the stem apparently passes through it.

Plants generally need little pruning.  If needed, prune immediately after flowering by cutting back flowering stems to a pair of healthy buds.  Prune out weak or winter-damaged stems in late winter/early spring.  Best to mulch plants year-round with 3"" of shredded  bark, peat or compost.  Winter hardy to USDA Zone 6. For added protection, however, plants grown in USDA Zone 5 should be sited in sheltered locations and given additional winter protection, as needed, for the purposes of minimizing the risk of loss of significant numbers of flower buds or possible die-back to the ground in an extremely harsh winter.  A burlap wrap of stems or circle of chicken wire filled with leaves or straw to 8-12"" are time-consuming and visually unattractive landscape options, but can be effective.  Regardless of protective measures taken, most bigleaf hydrangeas simply will not bloom (or will bloom poorly) in some years because of a variety of winter occurrences beyond the control of the gardener (e.g. low temperatures, sudden wide temperature fluctuations, icy conditions, late frosts). Some newer cultivars have been selected that flower on both old and new wood. Their pruning and flowering can differ from that of the species.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex decidua is a Missouri native, deciduous holly that is commonly called possum haw. It occurs on limestone glades and bluffs, along streams in wet woods, and in lowland valleys, sloughs and swamps. An upright shrub with a spreading, rounded crown which typically grows 7-15' tall in cultivation (to 30' in the wild). Obovate, narrow, glossy, dark green leaves (2-3"" long) turn a dull purplish green to yellow in autumn. The whitish flowers of both male and female plants are relatively inconspicuous. Pollinated female flowers give way to orange-red berries which ripen in September and persist throughout the winter until mid-March when new growth begins. Birds, deer and a variety of small mammals (including opossums as the common name suggests) are attracted to the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet refers to the species being deciduous not evergreen like most hollies.

It generally tolerates more drought than most other hollies. Although it is a popular landscape plant in the southeastern U.S., it is not winter hardy to the St. Louis area where, if attempted, it should be grown in a protected location with a winter mulch. Prune in winter if needed. Plants of this species are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Female plants need a male pollinator in the area in order to bear fruit. Promptly remove root suckers unless naturalization is desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex vomitoria, commonly known as Yaupon, is native to a variety of areas including sandy woods, dunes, open fields, forest edges and wet swamps, often along the coastal plain and maritime forests, from Virginia to Florida, Arkansas and Texas. This is a thicket-forming, broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows in an upright, irregularly branched form to 10-20’ tall and to 10’ wide, but may grow taller in optimum conditions. Elliptic to ovate-oblong, leathery, glossy, evergreen, dark green leaves (to 1.5” long) have toothed margins. Small greenish-white flowers appear on male and female plants in spring (April). Flowers are fragrant but generally inconspicuous. Pollinated flowers on female plants give way to berry-like red (infrequently yellow) fruits (1/4” diameter) which ripen in fall and persist into winter. Birds are attracted to the fruit. 

Native American Indians used the leaves to make a ceremonial emetic drink which, when consumed in large quantities, caused a cleansing now memorialized by the specific epithet.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet refers to the emetic quality of the leaves.
","
Problems
Winter hardiness in St. Louis is a significant concern. In their native habitat, plants have good resistance to insects and diseases.

Winter hardy to zones 7 to 10, Jasminum officinale prefer full sun to partial shade and a warm site. They grow well in regular garden soil with moderate levels of soil fertility and moisture, and they need frequent pinching and shaping to control growth. Indoors, jasmine are vigorous growers and most require support. They bloom from spring to fall and rest from October to March. After flowering, they should be pruned drastically. Repot, if necessary, at this time. They require high humidity and plenty of light to flower. Jasmine may be placed outdoors from May to September in partial shade. Keep plants cool in winter and let them rest. Make sure plants receive adequate, generous moisture during the growing season, but with good drainage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jasminum officinale, commonly called jasmine, is one of the first plants that comes to mind when one thinks of sweet fragrance. A single jasmine vine can perfume an entire room or garden. It is a sprawling, somewhat twining deciduous shrub, usually pruned heavily to keep its size contained. The foliage is slightly downy with pinnate leaves, having 5 to 9 leaflets. The flowers are white or very pale pink and fragrant from early summer to autumn.Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet means sold in shops.
","
Problems
Jasminum officinale is usually trouble free, but you should watch for mealybugs, scale and whitefly. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In warmer climates, jasmine can be pruned and used as hedging plants. It is not hardy north of zone 7 and should therefore be brought inside in late summer or early fall.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus horizontalis, commonly called creeping juniper, is a procumbent evergreen shrub that is native to Alaska, Canada and the northern U.S. from New England to New York to the Great Lakes, Wyoming and Montana.  Distribution in the northern U.S. is somewhat spotty.  It is typically found growing in rocky or sandy soils including rock outcroppings, stony slopes, coastal cliffs, prairies, sand dunes and stream banks.  It forms a low groundcover that generally rises to 6-18” tall but spreads by long trailing branches with abundant short branchlets to form an often-dense, 4-10’ wide mat.  Foliage is primarily scale-like (adult) with some awl/needle-like (juvenile) needles appearing usually in opposite pairs.  Foliage is typically green to blue-green during the growing season, but often acquires purple tones in winter.  Fleshy seed cones (dark blue berries) generally mature in two years, but are often absent on cultivated plants.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to the horizontal branches.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Junipers are generally susceptible to blights (dieback of stem tips), particularly in unusually rainy/wet springs.  Cedar-apple and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers.  Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils.  Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, webworm, and scale.  Watch for spider mites.  Foliage on mature plants will sometimes die back in the center.

Culture
Best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Does well in loamy, clay soils with good drainage.  Benefits from a slow release fertilizer.  Overly fertile soils tend to produce lush foliage growth at the expense of flowering with somewhat increased susceptibility to winter injury.  Water roots deeply, particularly in dry spells, but avoid wetting the foliage.  Plant in protected locations and apply a winter mulch.  Growing crape myrtles in the St. Louis area can be tricky because the above ground branches often die to the ground in winter, particularly when temperatures dip below -5 degrees F.  Above ground branches are considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 7, whereas roots are usually but not always hardy to USDA Zone 5.  In the St. Louis area (Zone 6a), some gardeners prefer to grow these plants in somewhat the same manner as buddleias (butterfly bushes) by cutting all stems back to 8” in early spring each year.  Roots will sprout new stems which typically grow 2-4’ tall (sometimes more) by the end of the growing season.  Flowers appear on the new wood.  It is also an option in St. Louis to grow these plants as woody shrubs by pruning them back to live wood in spring at the time new foliage begins to appear (in somewhat the same manner as with some shrub roses).  With protection, top growth will survive some winters, but may still suffer significant injury or die to the ground in harsh winters.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lagerstroemia indica, commonly known as crape myrtle, is an upright, wide-spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub or small tree in the loosestrife family.  It typically grows to 15-25’ tall.  It is native from the Himalayas through southern China, southeast Asia and Japan, but has naturalized in the U.S. from Virginia to Arkansas south to Texas and Florida.   An additional common name is Lilac of the South in reference to its popularity in southern gardens (USDA Zones 7-9).  Key ornamental features include long bloom period, exfoliating bark and superb fall color.  Terminal, crepe-papery inflorescences (to 6-18” long) of showy flowers with crimped petals bloom in summer (sometimes to frost) on upright branches.  In the wild, flowers are typically rose to red.  Cultivated varieties have expanded the flower color range to include white, pink, mauve, lavender and purple.  Alternate to sub-opposite, thick and leathery, privet-like, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3"" long) emerge light green often with a tinge of red, mature to dark green by summer and finally turn attractive shades of yellow-orange-red in fall.  Flowers give way to round seed capsules which often persist well into winter.  Smooth pale pinkish-gray bark on mature branches exfoliates with age.  In the St. Louis area where winter injury can be a problem, plants will typically grow to 6-10’ tall.  In the deep South, plants will grow much taller if not pruned back.  Straight species plants are not sold in commerce.  A multitude of named cultivars from dwarf to tree size have been introduced over the years, many of which are hybrids between L. indica and L. faueri.Genus name honors Magnus von Lagerstroem (1691-1759), Swedish botanist, Director of the Swedish East Indies Company and friend of Linnaeus.Specific epithet means of the Indies in reference to native territory.Common name is in reference to the crepe-papery inflorescences and the myrtle-like (Myrtus communis) features of the bark and foliage.
","
Problems
Two main disease problems of crape myrtles are fungal leaf spot and powdery mildew.  Foliage may yellow (chlorosis) in alkaline soils.  Some susceptibility to aphids and scale.  Winter injury, particularly to top growth, often occurs in USDA Zones 5 and 6.

Top growth winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 (roots hardy to Zone 9). In St. Louis, grow as annual bedding plants or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool (40s) locations. Container plants can be trained as standards. Easily grown as bedding plants in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates poor soils. Since plants for bedding are relatively inexpensive, most gardeners purchase new plants each spring rather than trying to overwinter ones from the current year. Cultivars generally do not come true from seed, however, so cuttings may be taken in summer from favorite plants for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lantana camara, commonly called lantana or shrub verbena, is native to the Central and South America. It is an upright frost-tender shrub that grows 3-6’ tall. It has escaped gardens throughout the world and is considered to be a noxious weed in many frost-free/tropical areas where it can rapidly spread to form dense thickets. It has naturalized in parts of the southern U.S. including southern Florida, the Gulf Coast and southern California. When grown in St. Louis, plants placed out in spring after last frost date may grow to as much as 3-4’ tall by the end of the summer. Tiny 5-lobed flowers in dense hemispherical clusters (to 2” diameter) bloom summer to fall. Flower colors include white, yellow, orange, red and purple, often mixed in the same cluster. Ovate, toothed, dark green leaves (to 4” long) are rough-wrinkled above. Leaves are aromatic when bruised. Many cultivars and hybrids are available, including dwarf and trailing plants, to the point where this species is seldom found in commerce. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Viburnum transferred to this genus.Specific epithet is a South American vernacular name for a species of Lantana.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium, well-drained, alkaline soil in full sun. English lavender can be difficult to grow in the St. Louis area, primarily because of winter stresses and high summer humidity. Well-drained soils are required, particularly in winter. Root rot commonly attacks plants grown in poorly drained soils. Prefers a light, sandy soil with somewhat low fertility. Remove faded flowers to promote continued bloom. Prune to shape in spring after new leaves appear. Prune back to 8” in spring every 3 years to control plant size and to promote robust, new growth. High summer humidity in the St. Louis area is not appreciated. To combat high humidity, consider using rock instead of organic mulch. English lavender has slightly better winter hardiness than lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia) for the St. Louis area, but still may appreciate a sheltered location and winter protection.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lavandula angustifolia, commonly called English lavender, has been a mainstay of herb gardens for many years. Despite its common name, it is not in fact native to England, but comes primarily from the Mediterranean region. It was reportedly named English lavender because of its ability to grow well in the English climate. This “true lavender” is commercially planted for harvesting its oils for use in perfumes. Lavender flowers and foliage are also popular additions to sachets and potpourris. English lavender varieties are more often used for culinary purposes than other types of lavender. This is a semi-woody plant that typically grows to 1.5-3’. Narrow, gray-green leaves (to 2 1/2” long) on square stems. Purple flowers appear in terminal spikes in late spring to early summer. Both foliage and flowers are highly aromatic. Leaves are evergreen in warm winter climates.Genus name comes from the Latin word lavo meaning I wash in reference to a former use of the plant as an aromatic wash.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.
","
Problems
Susceptible to leaf spot and root rot. Plants may not survive in winter if soils are not well-drained and/or if temperatures dip below zero degrees without protective snow cover.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is easily grown in alkaline, gravelly, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Add dolomitic limestone to acidic soils.  Plants thrive in gritty soils with minimal moisture.  Sharp drainage is essential.  Overwatering or poorly-drained soils must be avoided.  In areas of high rainfall, consider use of raised beds.   Plants prefer low humidity, but have excellent tolerance for drought and heat.  Do not fertilize plants.  Once established, plants require minimal maintenance.  Propagate by seed or cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Leucophyllum frutescens, commonly called Texas sage, silver leaf or barometer bush, is a compact but loosely branched shrub that typically grows to 5-8' tall.  Plants tend to sprawl with age unless pruned as needed.  This shrub is native to rocky limestone slopes in calcareous soils in the Chihuahuan Desert extending from northern Mexico into Texas and New Mexico.   Attractive silver gray leaves (to 1"" long) with stellate hairs are close to being evergreen, but some leaf drop will occur in winter.  Small, 5-lobed, tubular, purple flowers (to 1"" long) bloom singly from the leaf axils at various times during the year but primarily from summer into fall.  Flower bloom is typically triggered by rains or significant soil moisture, hence the common name of barometer bush.   Flowers give way to 2-valved capsules.Genus name comes from the Greek leucos meaning white and phyllon meaning white for the whitish foliage.Specific epithet from Latin means shrub-like in reference to plant form.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Miscanthus sinensis, commonly known as Chinese silver grass, Japanese silver grass or eulalia grass, is a clump-forming warm season grass that typically grows to 3-7’ tall.  It is native to lowlands and lower alpine areas in Japan, Korea and China.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in over 25 states in the Central and Eastern U.S. east of the Mississippi River plus in several western States including Colorado and California.   

This grass features a dense clump of upward-arching stems and leaves which give it a rounded, fountain-like appearance.  Linear leaves (to 3-4’ long and 3/8” wide) have tapered tips, serrate margins and whitish to silvery midribs.  Foliage often turns attractive shades of yellow to orange by mid-fall before gradually fading to beige-tan for winter.  Pink to red flowers in feathery, whisk-like, loose terminal panicles (8-10” long) bloom above the foliage from late August to October.  Flower panicles gradually turn beige by mid-fall as the seeds mature.  Flower panicles and foliage both retain good arching shape, beige color and ornamental interest throughout winter, with enhanced attractiveness often coming from a covering of new fallen snow.    

Miscanthus sinensis will spread somewhat invasively in the landscape, particularly in some of the milder areas of its growing range.  It often initially spreads to disturbed sites such as roadsides, railroad right-of-ways or woodland margins.  Invasive potential for the species is significant, but is of less concern for many of the numerous ornamental cultivars, some of which are sterile.Genus name comes from the Greek words miskos meaning a stem and anthos meaning flower in reference to the stalked spikelets.Specific epithet means Chinese.This grass was once included in the genus Eulalia, but was subsequently reclassified to the genus Miscanthus with retention of its common name of Eulalia grass by many gardeners.
","
Problems
No frequently occurring insect or disease problems.  In some areas of the U.S., miscanthus mealybug and miscanthus blight are becoming significant problems.  Miscanthus mealybug causes stunted growth and is difficult to eradicate because it lives inside the stems.  Miscanthus blight is a fungal disease which attacks the blades and sheaths.  Leaf rust may occur.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Muhlenbergia capillaris, commonly called pink muhlygrass or pink hair grass, is a clump-forming, warm season, perennial grass that is noted for its attractive summer foliage and spectacular clouds of fall flowers. It is native to prairies, pine barrens, and open woodlands from Massachusetts to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it most frequently occurs in acidic soils in open woods, glades or openings along roads primarily in central Ozark and western areas south of the Missouri River (see Steyermark). Glossy, wiry, thread-like, dark green leaves and stems form an attractive basal clump to 2’ tall. It is the fall flowering, however, that most distinguishes this grass. Masses of airy, open, loosely branched inflorescences (each to 12” long) in pink to pinkish-red float above the foliage in a lengthy fall bloom. Tan seed plumes remain attractive in winter. Plants typically grow to 3’ tall x 3’ wide when in flower.Genus name honors Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg (1753-1815), Lutheran pastor in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., distinguished amateur botanist.Specific epithet means fine or hair-like.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Muhlenbergia capillaris, commonly called pink muhlygrass or pink hair grass, is a clump-forming, warm season, perennial grass that is noted for its attractive summer foliage and spectacular clouds of fall flowers. It is native to prairies, pine barrens, and open woodlands from Massachusetts to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it most frequently occurs in acidic soils in open woods, glades or openings along roads primarily in central Ozark and western areas south of the Missouri River (see Steyermark). Glossy, wiry, thread-like, dark green leaves and stems form an attractive basal clump to 2’ tall. It is the fall flowering, however, that most distinguishes this grass. Masses of airy, open, loosely branched inflorescences (each to 12” long) in pink to pinkish-red float above the foliage in a lengthy fall bloom. Tan seed plumes remain attractive in winter. Plants typically grow to 3’ tall x 3’ wide when in flower.Genus name honors Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg (1753-1815), Lutheran pastor in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., distinguished amateur botanist.Specific epithet means fine or hair-like.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10 where it is easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Best initially grown with constant moisture, but once established in the landscape it will grow in a wide range of soil conditions ranging from wet swampy areas to dry xeric uplands.  This shrub is also tolerant of high winds and salt spray, and may be grown in seaside areas.  Fixes atmospheric nitrogen which helps it survive in poor soils.  Shrubs tend to sucker, sometimes forming sizable colonies in optimum growing conditions.  This shrub is similar to northern bayberry (M. pennsylvanica), but is by contrast a southern heat-loving evergreen species.   

This species is dioecious (male and female flowers borne in catkins on separate plants).  Female plants are preferred in the landscape because they produce the attractive and sometimes useful fruit.  At least one male plant is needed to facilitate pollination of the female flowers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Morella cerifera, commonly known as southern wax myrtle or southern bayberry, is a large, irregularly-shaped, dense-branching, nitrogen-fixing, suckering, fast-growing, evergreen  shrub (semi-evergreen in colder northern parts of the growing area) that typically grows to 10-15’ tall and 8-10’ wide, but occasionally reaches a tree-like height of 20’ tall or more.  It is native to the southeastern U.S. from New Jersey to Florida through the Gulf States to Oklahoma and Texas and further south into Mexico and Central America.  It is typically found in a variety of habitats including wetlands, river margins, sand dunes, pine barrens, hillsides, and upland forests.

The fruits of this species have been used for many years to make bayberry candles, soaps and sealing wax.

Glossy, aromatic, oblanceolate, olive green leaves (to 3-5” long) are dotted with tiny yellow resin glands.  Leaves, particularly the new growth, emit the distinctive bayberry candle fragrance when crushed.  Flowers are fragrant but non-showy, with only the flowers on male plants (catkins to 1” long) displaying some color (a drab yellowish-green).  Flowers bloom in late winter to early spring.  Pollinated female flowers are followed by small attractive clusters of tiny, globose, blue-gray fruits which mature in late summer to fall, with persistence through winter.  Each fruit is surrounded by an aromatic waxy substance.  

Birds eat the fruits in fall and winter, thus helping the plants to naturalize by disbursing the seed.     

These shrubs are considered to be potential fire hazards in some areas because the leaves, stems and branches contain flammable aromatic compounds.         

Myrica cerifera is a synonym.Specific epithet means wax-bearing.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf browning typically occurs in cold winters.  Watch for leaf anthracnose and leaf mosaic.
","
Garden Uses
Garden ornamental with a history of use for medicinal purposes and candlemaking.  This is a versatile shrub that can be used in woodland gardens or shrub borders, as a screen or informal hedge, in wet or shady sites, or on a bank for erosion control.  Salt tolerance makes it appropriate for locations near roads that are salted in winter.  Interesting plant for grouping in the corner of a large herb garden.  Good selection for stream or pond margins where periodic flooding or drought may occur.  Also attractive as a small tree with lower limbs removed.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Some tolerance for full shade, but foliage often grows best in sun with some afternoon shade.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers rich, moist, humusy ones.  Best with consistent watering.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Best fruiting occurs when grown in groups.  Single specimens may fruit poorly.  This shrub is evergreen in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10.  In the St. Louis area, it is considered to be semi-evergreen to deciduous because plants will typically lose their foliage (become deciduous) as soon as winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F., with the stems sometimes dying to the ground.  Plants are not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area, and if grown therein, should be sited in protected locations with organic winter mulches applied.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Nandina domestica, commonly called heavenly bamboo, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub that is ornamentally grown for its interesting foliage and its often spectacular fruit display.  It is native to Japan, China and India.  This is a rhizomatous, upright, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 4-8’ tall and to 2-4’ wide.  In St. Louis, it is semi-evergreen to deciduous, and typically grows shorter since the stems often will die to the ground in winter.  Although it belongs to the Barberry family, it is commonly called heavenly bamboo because its erect, cane-like stems and compound leaves resemble bamboo.  Tiny whitish flowers with yellow anthers appear in late spring in loose, erect, terminal clusters.  Flowers are followed by sprays of spherical, two-seeded, red berries which persist from fall to spring, providing winter interest. 

Heavenly bamboo tends to invade adjacent lands including certain forested areas of the southeastern U.S. and naturalize therein. It is now considered to be an invasive species in some southern states. Additionally, the berries of Nandina domestica have been linked to toxicity in cedar waxwing birds.Genus name is the Latinized form of the Japanese name of this plant Nanten.Specific epithet means domesticated.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage may develop chlorosis in alkaline soils.Plants tend to be invasive in the South.
","
Garden Uses
Plant form, foliage, fall color make this an interesting ornamental for the landscape. Group or mass for best effect. Shrub borders or open woodland gardens. Foundations. Good in informal settings. Can be used as an informal hedge in warm winter climates where it remains evergreen and does not die to the ground.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, grow in containers or tubs that are overwintered indoors or as year-round houseplants. Container plants may be grown as shrubs or trained as ornamental standards. Plants generally grow best when overwintering period is short. Since plants will tolerate some frost, consider leaving containers outside in fall until temperatures dip below 20 F. and return containers to a protected outdoor as soon as temperatures permit in spring. Overwinter in a cool location (40s F.) with moderate light and very little water or as a houseplant in a bright sunny but cool room with reduced water. Grows well in average, medium moisture soils in full sun to part shade. Oleander is native to dry Mediterranean stream beds, and established plants will tolerate some drought and poor soils. However, container plants seem to do best in fertile soils with good drainage. Water regularly but let plant soils dry out between waterings. Promptly deadhead spent blooms to prevent formation of non-ornamental seed pods. Cuttings may be taken in late summer. Prune lightly as needed to shape after flowering (late summer to fall).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Nerium oleander, commonly called oleander, is an upright, rounded evergreen sub-tropical to tropical shrub that is valued for its abundant, fragrant, summer to fall flowers. Purple, pink or white five-petaled funnel-shaped flowers in clusters (terminal cymes). Narrow, willow-like, linear-lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves (to 5” long) have distinctive midribs. All parts of this plant are poisonous if ingested. Plant saps can cause allergic skin reactions in some people. Smoke from burning plant material can also be quite toxic.

For winter, cut plants to the ground and remove from the garden plus clean up all plant areas in order to minimize possible powdery mildew infection for the following growing season. Remove faded flower panicles to prolong bloom period and to prevent unwanted self-seeding (cultivars generally do not come true from seed).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Phlox paniculata, commonly known as garden phlox, is native from New York to Iowa south to Georgia, Mississippi and Arkansas.   It has escaped gardens and naturalized into areas beyond its original native range.  In Missouri, it is typically found south of the Missouri River in moist or rich low woods, thickets, alluvial banks and gravel bars along streams and bluff bases (Steyermark).  This is an upright perennial that grows in a clump to 2-4' tall and to 2-3' wide on stiff stems clad with conspicuously veined, opposite, pointed, elliptic, deep green leaves (to 4-6"" long).   Fragrant, tubular, pink-purple to white florets (to 3/4” diameter) are densely packed in large, tiered, domed terminal clusters (to 6-8"") over a long July to September bloom period.  Each individual floret has a long corolla tube and five flat petal-like lobes.  Butterflies love the flowers.  

A large number of garden phlox cultivars in flower colors including white, lavender, pink, rose, red and bi-color are available in commerce.  Cultivars resistant to powdery mildew are often the best choices.The genus name is derived from the Greek word phlox meaning flame in reference to the intense flower colors of some varieties.Specific epithet refers to the plant bearing flowers in panicles.
","
Problems
Phlox is not always an easy plant to grow well. Phlox bugs, powdery mildew and root rot can be serious problems. Spider mites can also be a problem, particularly in hot, dry conditions. Taller stems may need staking.
","
Garden Uses
Garden phlox is a staple of the perennial border. Mixes well with other perennials and provides long summer bloom. Regardless of flower color, garden phlox is attractive to hummingbirds and is a good selection for inclusion in a bird garden.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this date palm is best grown in fertile, medium moisture, well drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade. Although this palm will withstand some frost in winter, it is likely to suffer significant frond damage or die when temperatures dip to 20 degrees F.  Best with deep and even moisture. Established plants have respectable drought tolerance. Plants will naturalize to the point of being invasive in some growing conditions (seed floats down watercourses or seed is spread by bird populations). Invasive spread has been observed in southern California where plants have invaded watercourses, orchards, coastlines and to a lesser extent some landscaped areas.  This palm performs well in containers where much more compact growth typically occurs.  Container plants often thrive in a soil based potting mix in full sun, but with some part shade during the heat of the day. In cool climates, containers may be overwintered indoors in bright but cool (55-65 degree F.) temperatures. If container soils are overwatered, leaflet tips turn yellowish-black.  If container soils are underwatered, fronds will sag.  Reduce watering of indoor plants in winter but do not allow soils to totally dry out. Container plants tend to remain compact for long periods of time.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Phoenix canariensis, commonly called Canary Island date palm, is a large evergreen palm tree with a massive trunk that matures to 40-60' (less frequently to as much as 90') tall. Notwithstanding size, this palm is a slow grower which may only reach 10' tall over the first 15 years. The trunk is topped with a rounded crown of upright arching palmate leaves which gracefully spread to 20-40' wide. Although native to the Canary Islands, this palm is now grown in frost-free areas around the world. In the U.S., it is grown in Florida, Georgia (southern coast), Gulf Coast, Texas (southern), Arizona, Nevada and California.  It will grow in Hawaii, but distribution there appears to be limited.  This palm is noted for having a massive, thick, columnar, single, gray-brown trunk (matures to as much as 4' in diameter) with distinctive diamond-shaped leaf base scars. Trunk is topped by arching pinnate fronds (each to 15-20' long). Each frond has 80-100 rigid, narrow, lanceolate leaflets (to 12-18"" long) on each side of the central rachis. The leafless lower portion of each petiole is covered with sharp spines (2-3"" long). Creamy white to pale yellow flowers in dense, pendant panicles (to 3-4' long) bloom on male and female plants (dioecious) intermittently throughout the year. Flowers on female palms are followed by yellow-orange, date-like fruits (to 1"" long) which are ornamentally showy but poor-tasting to the point of being only technically edible.Genus name comes from the Greek name.Specific epithet means of the Canary Islands.

Site in areas with good air circulation to help rid the dense foliage of moisture.  Somewhat intolerant of urban stresses such as air pollutants and salt spray.  Plants will struggle in the high heat and humidity of St. Louis summers, and should not be grown in the eastern U.S. south of USDA Zone 6.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Picea glauca, commonly called white spruce, is an extremely hardy evergreen conifer that is native to upland areas and lake/stream margins stretching from Alaska across the boreal forest of Canada to Newfoundland, dipping south to Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York.  This tree typically grows 60-80' tall (less frequently to 140' tall) with a cone-shaped crown.  It diminishes in size to low, shrubby forms near tree line in northern Canada.  Blue-green needles (to 3/4"") on small woody pegs have sharp tips.  Needles are pungently aromatic when  crushed.  Needles have a glaucous (white waxy coating) bloom, hence the specific epithet and common name.  Branchlets do not droop.  Cylindrical pale brown cones (to 2.5"" long) have flexible scales.Genus name is reportedly derived from the Latin word pix meaning pitch in reference to the sticky resin typically found in spruce bark.Specific epithet both are in reference to the fact that mature needles of this tree become glaucous (acquire a waxy white bloom) with age.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to needle and stem rust, canker, trunk and root rot.  Yellow-headed spruce sawfly, spruce budworm and eastern spruce beetle are problems in some areas.  Mites are common and repeated infestations can do serious injury to the plant.

Generally tolerant of urban conditions. Early spring flowers may be damaged by frost. Prune as needed in winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Pyrus calleryana, commonly called Callery pear, is native to China and Taiwan. It is an upright-branched ornamental tree. It grows pyramidal to columnar in youth, but tends to become oval to spreading with age. It is noted for its early profuse spring bloom, quality glossy green foliage and often excellent fall color. Shoots on species plants are thorny, but some cultivars are thornless. It produces small, inedible, greenish-yellow fruits (to 1/2” diameter) which are of little practical value or ornamental interest. Joseph Callery, a French missionary, discovered and collected this plant in China in 1858. In 1917, seed was brought to the U.S. from China for hybridization experiments aimed at improving fireblight resistance for the common fruiting pear (P. communis). The experiments generally proved unsuccessful. In the 1950s, callery pear emerged in U.S. commerce as a promising new ornamental tree, leading to massive landscape plantings. By the 1980s, concerns about both overplanting and structural weakness (limb breakage from wind, ice and snow) began to surface. Today, additional concerns about invasiveness (non-sterile forms are escaping cultivation and naturalizing in some areas) are being addressed. Narrow-oval, glossy dark green leaves (to 3” long) have distinctively wavy margins. Leaves dance in the breeze due to long petioles. Leaves turn attractive reddish-purple to bronze-red in fall. Five-petaled, creamy white flowers (each to 3/4” wide) in dense corymbs appear in profusion in early spring.Specific epithet and common name honor Joseph Callery, a French missionary, who discovered and collected this plant in China in 1858.‘Aristocrat’ is a thornless, oval-pyramidal, ornamental pear that typically grows to 25-35’ tall and to 20-25’ wide. It has more horizontal branching than on many other callery cultivars.
","
Problems
‘Aristocrat’ is an attractive ornamental flowering tree for the landscape. It is susceptible to limb breakage or splitting from strong winds, snow or ice, but has better structural strength that some other callery cultivars such as P. calleryana ‘Bradford’. It is also susceptible to fireblight. Viable seed can be produced when Callery pear cultivars  cross-pollinate. Please see below for more information on its invasive spread in Missouri and other states.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Quercus macrocarpa, commonly called bur oak or mossycup oak, is one of the most majestic of the native North American oaks. It is a medium to large sized deciduous oak of the white oak group that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 150’) tall with a broad-spreading, rounded crown. Acorn cups are covered with a mossy scale or bur near the rim, hence the common names. It is native to a variety of habitats in central and eastern North America. Best growth occurs in bottomland soils, particularly in the Ohio River valley. In Missouri, it typically occurs in low woods and stream valleys in the Ozark region, but on dry upland soils in the unglaciated parts of the state north of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 1 1/2” long), with fringed, burry cups that extend to approximately 1/2 to 3/4 the acorn length. Acorns are an important source of food for wildlife. Leathery, dark green leaves (6-12” long) with 5-9 rounded lobes are variable in shape, but usually have a pair of deep central sinuses that extend nearly to the midrib giving the leaf a waisted appearance. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow-brown. Twigs sometimes are ridged with corky wings.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words macro meaning large and carpa meaning fruit in reference to the large acorn size.
","
Problems
Oaks are susceptible to a large number of diseases, including oak wilt, chestnut blight, shoestring root rot, anthracnose, oak leaf blister, cankers, leaf spots and powdery mildew. Potential insect pests include scale, oak skeletonizer, leaf miner, galls, oak lace bugs, borers, caterpillars and nut weevils. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, bur oak is generally considered to be a low-maintenance, long-lived tree.

Culture
Best grown in acidic, humusy, well-drained loams in part shade.  This species of azalea is tolerant of moist to wet soils including ones with somewhat poor drainage (its native habitat is swampy lowland areas).  It also tolerates periodic flooding, but will not grow in soils where the roots are submerged in water.  Root rot is less likely to occur with this species.  Prefers a sun dappled shade or high open part shade.  Foliage may scorch in full sun unless soils are kept uniformly moist.  Roots must never be allowed to dry out. Acidify soils prior to planting and thereafter as needed.  This azalea should never be planted near a black walnut or butternut tree (roots of both trees produce toxic juglones which will typically damage or kill rhododendrons/azaleas growing within or close to the drip line of either tree).  It is best sited in a location protected from strong winter winds.  This shrub has a shallow, fibrous root system (do not cultivate around the shrub) and will benefit from a good mulch (wood chips, bark or pine needles) for retention of moisture, stabilization of soil temperatures and winter protection.  Clip off spent flower clusters immediately after bloom as practicable.  Plants will slowly naturalize by root suckers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Rhododendron viscosum, commonly known as swamp azalea, is a loose, upright-spreading, deciduous woody shrub that typically grows to 3-5' (less frequently to 8') tall.  Branching opens up with age.  It is one of 17 species of azalea which are native to the U.S.   It is typically found in swamps, bogs, stream margins and wet lowlands from southwestern Maine to northeastern Ohio south to Florida and Alabama.  It may be found at some higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains.  Fragrant (musky clove-like aroma), tubular, white to pale pink flowers (1 1/4"" across) bloom in clusters of 4-9 after the leaves have emerged in May-July (one of the last of the native azaleas to flower).  Each flower has 5 petal-like lobes.  Narrow, obovate to oblong-ovate leaves (to 2  1/2"" long) with wedge-shaped bases and blunt/short-pointed tips are clustered at the branch ends.  Leaves are dark green above and pale green below.  Leaves turn attractive shades of yellow, orange and purple in fall.  Branchlets are hirsute (stiff hairs).  Fruits are egg-shaped capsules (to 3/4"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek words rhodo meaning rose and dendron meaning tree. Transferred from the Greek name for Nerium oleander.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word viscosus meaning sticky in reference to the sticky substance excreted by glandular hairs on the corolla tubes of the flowers.Additional common names include clammy azalea in reference to its sticky (viscous) corolla tubes and honeysuckle azalea (even though it is a rhododendron and not a honeysuckle) in reference to the resemblance of its flowers in both appearance and fragrance to the flowers of some honeysuckles.
","
Problems
Azaleas are susceptible to many insect and disease problems, including but not limited to canker, crown rot, root rot, leaf spot, rust, powdery mildew, aphids, borers, lacebugs, leafhoppers, mealybugs, mites, nematodes, scale, thrips and whitefly.  A healthy plant in the proper environment with proper care should have limited problems, however.
","
Garden Uses
Best grouped in shrub borders, mixed borders, open woodland gardens, native plant gardens and open shade gardens.  Effective near patios or decks.  Specimen around the home.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Rosa carolina, commonly called pasture rose, is a Missouri-native shrub which occurs in both dryish and wet soils throughout the State. Typically found in glades, open woods, prairies, along roads and railroads, and in wet soils along streams and swamps and low areas. Grows from 1-3' tall (less frequently to 6') and often spreads by suckers to form colonies or thickets in the wild. Features single (5-petaled), pink flowers (to 2.5"" across) which bloom in May. No repeat bloom. Smooth, dark green foliage. Red hips in late summer.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means of North or South Carolina.
","
Problems
Roses are susceptible to a large number of diseases, the most common of which are black spot, powdery mildew, rust and rose rosette. Although good cultural practices are the first line of defense in disease control, regular preventative fungicide applications throughout the growing season are generally required in humid climates with regular summer rainfall such as the St. Louis area. This species rose has better natural resistance to the aforementioned diseases than most hybrid roses. Potential insect problems include aphids, beetles, borers, scale, thrips, rose midges, leafhoppers and spider mites.

Culture
Best grown in moist, slightly acidic, well-drained garden loams in full sun to part shade, but this rose is also very adaptable to somewhat poor soils, including sandy, clay or gravelly ones.  Best flowering and disease resistance generally occur in full sun.  Water deeply and regularly (mornings are best).  Avoid overhead watering.  Excellent drainage is one of the keys to growing this shrub well.  Avoid wet soils.  Good air circulation promotes vigorous and healthy growth and helps control foliar diseases.  Summer mulch helps retain moisture, keeps roots cool and discourages weeds.  Remove spent flowers to encourage rebloom (flower removal does prevent hip growth).  Remove and destroy diseased leaves from plants, as practicable, and clean up and destroy dead leaves from the ground around the plants both during the growing season and as part of a thorough cleanup during winter (dormant season). Prune as needed in late winter to early spring.   This rose is winter hardy to USDA Zone 2 where temperatures can dip to -50 degrees F. in winter.   It has escaped plantings and naturalized in at least nineteen states (mostly in the northeast and central U. S.).  Inland, it has escaped gardens, often being found along roadsides and railroad right of ways.  Along the Atlantic coast (Maine to Virginia) and Great Lakes regions it grows exceedingly well in sand and has over time naturalized in dry sandy/gravelly coastal plains, sandy beaches and sand dune habitats (giving rise to additional common names of beach rose and salt spray rose).   It can be invasive in some areas (particularly New England coastal areas).  It is very tolerant of salt spray.  Seeds are spread not only by birds and animals, but also in coastal areas by seawater.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Rosa rugosa is native to northern China, Korea and Japan.  It is a bristly, prickly, sprawling, suckering shrub rose that typically grows in a rounded form to 4-6' tall and as wide.  Unless restrained, it will over time spread by suckers to form dense thickets.  Odd-pinnate dark green leaves (each with 5-9 leaflets) turn yellow (sometimes a quality orange-red) in fall.  Each leaflet (to 2"" long) has pronounced veins, a wrinkled appearance, serrated edges and downy undersides.  Fragrant flowers are rose pink to white (to 3 1/4"" across).  Flowers are primarily single (5 petals), but are semi-double or double in some varieties and hybrid cultivars.  Flowers appear singly or in clusters.  Flowers primarily bloom from late May to July, with some additional scattered bloom to early fall.  Flowers are followed by fleshy, edible (with some bitterness), tomato-shaped hips (to 1"" diameter) which appear green but ripen to bright red by late summer and persist on the shrub until late fall sometimes extending into winter.   Hips are used to make jams and jellies (rose hip jam).  Deadheading spent flowers may encourage rebloom, but at the cost of preventing rose hip development.  Stems are covered with abundant sharp thorns, making this an excellent impenetrable hedge.  Ability to thrive in sandy seashore habitats combined with tomato-shaped hips led to the additional common names of beach tomato and sea tomato for this shrub.  Because of its tolerance for salt and sand, this rose has been planted along ocean shores to help stabilize beaches/control beach erosion.  Many varieties and hybrid cultivars (single to double flowers in colors of pink, purple or white) have been developed.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means wrinkled in reference to the appearance of the foliage.

Winter hardy to USDA Zone 8-10 where it may be grown in light, slightly acidic, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade, but best performance is in full sun.  Established plants have good drought tolerance.  Performs poorly in heavy clay soils.  Wet, poorly-drained soils in winter are usually fatal.  If desired, prune plants after bloom to encourage dense foliage growth.  Plants may also be pruned to specific shapes.  Best propagated by cuttings.  Plants are not winter hardy in the St. Louis area where they are typically grown in containers (clay pots best) which are brought indoors in fall and overwintered in a sunny, humid but cool room with good air circulation (powdery mildew often appears when air circulation is poor). Best indoor location is in a sunny southern window.  If at least 6 hours of sun per day cannot be provided indoors, then use of supplemental lighting (grow lights or florescent lamps) should be considered. Let soil dry out between water applications (dry on top, but not dry throughout). Avoid overwatering which inevitably leads to root rot. Take containers outside in mid-spring after the last frost date.'Blue Spires' offers increased cold hardiness compared to other rosemary selections.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a generally erect, rounded, evergreen shrub with aromatic, needle-like, gray-green leaves and tiny, two-lipped, pale blue to white flowers.  It typically grows to 4-6’ tall in areas where it is winter hardy.  The intensely fragrant foliage of this shrub is commonly harvested for a variety of purposes including culinary flavorings, toiletries and sachets.  These plants also add excellent ornamental value to borders, herb gardens, patio areas and foundations both when grown in the ground and/or as container plants which are often brought indoors for overwintering.  Rosemary is native to dry scrub and rocky places in the Mediterranean areas of southern Europe to western Asia.  Gray-green, linear, needle-like leaves (to 1.5” long) are closely spaced on the stems and are very aromatic with a strong flavor.  Tiny, two-lipped flowers bloom in axillary clusters along the shoots of the prior year’s growth.  Where grown outdoors in USDA Zones 8-10, flowers typically bloom from January to April.  Some sporadic additional bloom may occur in summer or fall, particularly if plants are trimmed after the late winter to spring bloom.  Container plants overwintered indoors will typically bloom later (late spring into summer).  Flowers are attractive to bees.The specific epithet officinalis refers to the medicinal uses of this species.'Blue Spires' is an upright, densely branched, evergreen rosemary selection that will reach around 5' tall with a 4' spread. Small blue flowers bloom seasonally from the leaf axils. The flowers are highly attractive to butterflies.
","
Problems
Rosemary is often a difficult plant to overwinter indoors.  It is susceptible to powdery mildew, particularly when air circulation is poor.  Botrytis is also a potential concern.  Root rots may occur if plants are overwatered.  Watch for aphids, mealybugs, whiteflies and spider mites on indoor plants (less of a problem on outdoor plants). For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, grow in herb gardens, rock gardens, seaside gardens, borders or foundations.  Ornamental specimen or low hedge.  Container plants are attractive additions to patios, decks and other sunny areas around the home. Can be pruned into a topiary.

Leaves may be used (fresh or dried) in a variety of cooking applications such as stews, breads, stuffings, herbal butters or vinegars.  Leaves also provide excellent flavor to meats, fish and vegetables.  Leaves and flowers are used in sachets.  Oil is commercially used in some perfumes, soaps, shampoos, lotions and other toiletries. 

Rosemary has a long history of uses for a variety of medicinal and curative applications, some of which are of unsubstantiated value.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, slightly acidic, moist but well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Intolerant of wet soils which can cause root rot.  When grown for harvest of its raspberry fruits, raised beds should be considered in areas with heavy clay soils.  Prune out fruiting canes of both summer and everbearing cultivars in summer immediately after fruiting and any non-fruiting canes that exhibit weakness or disease.  new shoot will develop and, everbearing cultivars will produce fruit on the tips of these shoots. In late winter, remove any canes damaged by winter and thin, as needed, the remaining canes.  Cut back the tips of everbearers that fruited last fall but leave the rest of cane for summer fruiting. Promptly remove excess new plants and suckers to control spread.  Stems may root where they touch the ground.  Plants adapt to a variety of soils, preferring those that are reasonably fertile and of medium and consistent moisture.  Most do well in sun, but a few prefer light shade.  Pruning is essential in order to keep plants well-maintained.  It is generally best to prune out old, summer-bearing canes as soon as fruiting is over for purposes of encouraging the production of new canes.  Raspberry roots are perennial but the leaf- and fruit-bearing canes are biennial, each cane living only two growing seasons before dying. In the wild, plants spread by suckers, stolons, rhizomes or root crowns to rapidly colonize certain areas, particularly disturbed areas such as those left after logging or forest fires.  If grown for ornamental reasons, raspberries are best located in areas where they can naturalize.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Rubus idaeus, commonly called red raspberry, is, for the most part, an erect-to spreading- to sprawling, thicket-forming, deciduous shrub with biennial, often prickly, cane-like stems.  It typically grows to 3-9’ tall. This genus has two main varieties, namely, Rubus idaeus var. idaeus (European raspberry) which is native to Eurasia and Rubus idaeus var. strigosa (American red raspberry) which is native to a large part of North America from Alaska and Canada south to California, Oklahoma and North Carolina.  In the wild, raspberries typically grow in a variety of locations including open woods, ravines, heaths, streambanks, bluffs and wooded mountain slopes.  

Commercially grown raspberries are mostly cultivars of European raspberry or American red raspberry or crosses between the two varieties.    

Raspberry shrubs are primarily grown for harvesting the tasty fruits.  Leaves are alternate, usually divided into 3-5 leaflets which are arranged pinnately, pedately, or less commonly palmately, but infrequently undivided.  First year stems (primocanes) bear only leaves.  Lateral branches in the second year (floricanes) produce leaves, flowers and fruits.  Flowers are in clusters, racemes or panicles, but are occasionally solitary, and are generally white but sometimes pink to rosy-purple.  Flowers bloom in spring.  Each flower has five petals, five sepals, five bracts, numerous stamens, and several pistils clustered on a cone-shaped core known as a receptacle.   Botanically the fruits are not berries (though they are usually called berries), but are coherent aggregations of tiny drupelets.  Fruits separate from the receptacle when picked with each raspberry resembling a hollow cone.  Fruits ripen in summer.  Many wild raspberries have very little garden merit, and, if not properly cared for, can easily spread to form tangled masses of impenetrable, thorny stems.Genus name is the Latin name for brambles (blackberry and raspberry).Specific epithet means of Mt. Ida in reference to the belief that raspberries were first discovered on Mt. Ida in Greece.
","
Problems
Anthracnose, botrytis, root rot and other fungal diseases can cause serious problems that may necessitate chemical treatments.  Cane borers and crown borers are potentially serious insect pests.
","
Garden Uses
Raspberries are primarily grown for harvest of their tasty fruits.  Cultivars featuring raspberries superior in size and flavor to those of species plants are available in commerce for planting in home gardens plus are commercially grown for sale of the fruit around the world to those who covet the taste of a raspberry.  The straight species is rarely grown in home gardens for fruit production.  

Raspberries are sometimes grown for foliage accent in spreading colonies.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3 to 6 or 7 where it is best grown in deep, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best foliage color is in full sun.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers moist, humusy, nutrient-rich, neutral to slightly acidic loams.  Spreads by root suckers to form colonies.  Prune suckers as they appear unless naturalizing.  A large number of late winter pruning options include (a) pruning out dead or weakened stems, (b) shortening one year stems or (c) cutting some stems back to the ground to rejuvenate.  Some horticulturists recommend a hard spring pruning for maintaining best foliage appearance and habit.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Sambucus racemosa, commonly known as red elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous suckering shrub which typically grows to 8-12’ tall with a somewhat sprawling habit.  It features (1) opposite, pinnate-compound, green leaves (6-9” long) which have 5-7 leaflets (each to 4” long), (2) dome-shaped clusters (panicled cymes) of numerous, late spring to early summer, tiny, fragrant, white flowers and (3) dark red (black in the case of the Rocky Mountain elderberry known as S. racemosa var. melanocarpa), summer-to-fall elderberry fruits in upright clusters.  This shrub is native to Europe, northern Asia and parts of Alaska, across Canada and the northern U.S.  south to California and New Mexico but mostly south in the central and eastern states to South Dakota, Missouri, and Georgia where it is typically found growing in moist woodlands, thickets, stream banks, fields, fence rows and roadsides.  

Fruits are sour and usually not consumed raw by humans, but may be cooked for use in the preparation of wine, jelly and pies.  Fruits are attractive to wildlife.   

Historically, Sambucus racemosa (native to Europe and Asia) was commonly known as European red elder and the very similar Sambucus pubens also known as S. racemosa var. pubens (native to North America) was known as American red elder.   Many authorities have now grouped both of these red elders together under the name of Sambucus racemosa.Genus name comes from the Latin name, perhaps connected with sambuca a kind of harp.Specific epithet means with flowers in racemes.

Culture
The Thanksgiving cactus is also commonly called the holiday or crab cactus. It grows best in light shade. Full sunlight is beneficial in midwinter, but bright sun during the summer months can make plants look pale and yellow. Ideal growth occurs at temperatures between 70° and 80° F during its growing season from April to September. Do not let temperatures rise above 90° F once the flower buds are set in the fall. Continuous warm temperatures can cause flower buds to drop.

The secret of good flower bud production involves temperature and dark (photoperiod) control. For best flowering provide 1) Bright light, 2) Night temperatures between 55° and 65° F, and 3) Long nights – thirteen hours or more of continuous darkness each day is required before flowering will occur. Long nights should be started about the middle of September and continued for eight weeks.

Water the growing medium when it is dry to the touch. The holiday cactus is tolerant of dry, slightly under-watered conditions. Do not let the soil become waterlogged, especially during the dark days of winter. Do not let the soil dry out either. Reduce watering from fall through spring. Fertilize plants monthly from the time new growth starts in late winter or early spring, and throughout the summer using a one-quarter strength soluble fertilizer. Reduce fertilizer during the fall and early winter.

The Thanksgiving cactus flowers best when kept somewhat potbound. Repotting is necessary only about once in three years. The potting media must be well-drained with good aeration, because the plant does not grow well in heavy, wet mixes. A good mix may contain one part potting soil, two parts peat moss and one part sharp sand or perlite.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Schlumbergera truncata, commonly called crab cactus, Thanksgiving cactus or holiday cactus, is all the same plant. It is a popular, winter-flowering houseplant native to Brazil, available in a wide variety of colors including red, purple, oranges, pinks and creams. In its native environment, these cacti grow on rocks or in trees where hummingbirds pollinate the flowers. The stems are segmented, flattened to round in cross-section, with weak or no spines. The stems are graceful and arching and are an easy-care plant for most homes.Genus name honors Frederick Schlumberger, Belgian horticulturist.Specific epithet mean cut off square.
","
Problems
This cactus commonly drops unopened flower buds, which may be induced by an excessive number of buds or a sudden change in temperature, light or other environmental factors, such as drying out of the growing medium. Lack of flowering is often due to light interrupting the long night period (13 hours) that is required for flowering initiation to occur. The major disease is root rot, which can be prevented by avoiding excessive watering. Insects and related pests include mealybugs, soft brown scale, red spider mites and aphids. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In its native area, Schlumbergera truncata is grown outdoors as an epiphyte or in rock gardens. In cooler climates, this plant can be grown in baskets or pots for brightly-lit window sills. It is sold primarily around the holiday season as a gift or decorative item.

Culture
The soil for the peace lily should be kept moist but not soggy. Let the soil dry between waterings, but do not allow to wilt; this causes the leaves to yellow. When watering, use water that is at room temperature and has been allowed to sit so that the chlorine can evaporate. Spathiphyllum grow very well with sub-irrigation. These plants do well in lower light situations, but prefer bright filtered light. Do not place in direct sun. When grown indoors, Spathiphyllum have very low fertility needs. Apply fertilizer at one quarter of the recommended strength. Over fertilizing can produce burning of tips and roots. Peace lilies enjoy warm conditions between 68 and 85F during the day and a 10 degree drop at night. Cold, and drafty conditions in the 40’s and 50’s will slow growth considerably. Extended periods below 40 can damage leaves, stems and roots. The plant requires a large pot and should be kept somewhat potbound. Repot, if necessary in February or March.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Spathiphyllum is Greek for leaf-spathe, referring to the character of the spathe, which is the bract or leaf surrounding or subtending a thick, protruding flower cluster. This easy care plant has beautiful glossy green leaves and the unusual ability to blossom in medium light. The pure white flower changes to pale green after 10 days and then remains lovely for at least another month.Genus name comes from the Greek word spathe and phyllon meaning a leaf from the leaflike spathe.
","
Problems
Few pest problems are associated with this plant. Mealybugs are probably the most common insect indoors. Because of the wide foliage, cleaning the leaves regularly with a damp cloth to remove dust will help not only in appearance but also in removing some pests which tend to gather under the bottom of the leaves.
","
Garden Uses
In recent years, peace lilies have gained a reputation for their ability to remove vaporized solvents from the atmosphere. Because of this, along with their ability to flower with fairly low light levels, they are widely used as pot plants in shopping malls and offices.

Spiraea prunifolia, commonly called bridalwreath spirea or just bridalwreath, is an upright, clumping, deciduous shrub with arching branching. It typically grows 4-8’ tall with a similar spread, often becoming somewhat open and leggy over time. It is particularly noted for its early spring bloom of double white flowers (each to 1/3” diameter) that appear in April in 3- to 6-flowered clusters (stalkless corymbs) in an often profuse bloom along the bare branching prior to the emergence of the foliage. Small, elliptic to ovate, finely-toothed, shiny dark green leaves (to 1.5” long) are soft-pubescent beneath. Foliage often develops attractive red-orange-yellow fall color. S. prunifolia ‘Plena’ is the long-favored bridalwreath that is regularly sold in commerce. Species plants as well as the single-flowered plant (Spiraea prunifolia var. simpliciflora) are generally not available. It should be noted that the double-flowered plant was botanically described prior in time to the single-flowered plant, hence the double flower became the species and the single flower became a variety or form of the species.Genus name comes from the Greek word speira meaning wreath in reference to the showy flower clusters seen on most shrubs in the genus.Specific epithet means with leaves like the genus Prunus.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Too much shade, however, may impede leaf drying and promote the onset of disease. The woolly leaves of this plant tend to trap moisture, and in humid climates such as the St. Louis area, plant leaves are susceptible to attack from rot and leaf spot where too much moisture is present. Plants are generally drought tolerant. Avoid overwatering. If mid-summer foliage decline occurs, pick off damaged leaves as needed. Spreads by creeping stems that root as they go along the ground and can be mildly aggressive in rich soils. Site starter plants 12-18” apart for use as a ground cover. Divide when necessary. Flowers are not particularly showy, and many gardeners prefer to remove the flowering stems as they appear to enhance the ground cover effect.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Stachys byzantina, known as lamb's ears, is grown primarily for its thick, soft, velvety, silver-gray leaves which typically form a rapidly spreading mat approximately 4-6"" off the ground. Leaves are evergreen in warm climates, but will depreciate considerably in harsh winters. Erect, small-leaved flowering stems with terminal spikes of insignificant, tiny, purplish-pink flowers appear in summer rising above the foliage to 10-15"" tall. Many gardeners remove the flowering stems to enhance the ground cover effect. Dense rosettes of woolly, tongue-shaped, gray-green leaves (to 4"" long) spread by runners. Leaf shape and texture resemble a lamb's ear, hence the common name.Genus name comes from the Greek stacys meaning ear of corn in probable reference to the inflorescence of a related plant.Specific epithet means of classical Byzantium (Istanbul, Turkey).Several cultivars of this species, the best of which is 'Helene Von Stein', have the advantages over the species of having better summer foliage and rarely producing flowering stems.
","
Problems
Tends to rot and develop leaf diseases in humid summer climates. Well-drained soils are essential in order to combat potential rot problems which often occur in humid St. Louis summers. Even with well-drained soils, some summer die-out may occur where high humidity and/or moisture on foliage is present. Can spread aggressively.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Tulbaghia violacea, commonly called society garlic, is a tender perennial that is native to grassland areas in southern Africa. It somewhat resembles garlic chives (Allium tuberosum) in appearance. From a tuberous rootstock, a clump of narrow, strap-shaped, gray-green leaves rises to 12” tall. Leaves and rootstock have a strong garlic smell when bruised, hence the common name. In early summer, flowering scapes rise to 20” tall bearing terminal umbels of sweetly fragrant lilac-pink flowers. Each small flower (3/4” long) has a tubular corona spreading to an open star with six pointed tepals. Flowering continues on and off throughout the summer into fall. Flowers and leaves are edible (mild garlic flavor), and may be used in soups and salads.Genus name honors Rijk Tulbagh (1699-1771), Dutch Governor of the Cape of Good Hope.Specific epithet means violet-colored.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Slugs and snails may damage the foliage. All parts of this plant emit a strong garlic odor, which contributes to its deer and rabbit resistance.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Ulmus parvifolia, commonly called Chinese elm or lacebark elm, is a medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to 40-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with a rounded crown and long pendulous branching. It is native to China, Korea and Japan. It is noted for its excellent foliage, multi-colored bark, rapid growth and good resistance to Dutch elm disease. Insignificant, small, reddish-green flowers appear in late summer. Flowers give way to single-seeded wafer-like samaras (each tiny seed is surrounded by a flattened circular papery wing) that mature in fall. Elliptic to ovate, shiny dark green leaves (to 3” long) have small teeth. Leaves typically turn an undistinguished dull yellow in fall, but sometimes produce more interesting yellows or reddish-purples. One of the most ornamental features of this tree is its mottled bark. On mature trees, bark flakes to reveal patches of gray, cream, orange, brown and green.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means small leaf in reference to the small leaves of this species.
","
Problems
Chinese elm has good resistance to Dutch elm disease, a fatal fungal disease spread by airborne bark beetles. It also has good resistance to Japanese beetle and elm leaf beetle. Occasional disease problems include wilts, rots, cankers and leaf spots. Branches tend to break when stressed with snow, ice or wind. This species should not be confused with the much inferior Siberian elm, Ulmus pumila, which is often referred to as Chinese elm.

Culture
Best grown in loose, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plant in sheltered locations north of USDA Zone 7. In USDA Zones 5 and 6, this shrub often suffers winter dieback or dies to the ground. It is not considered reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5. Even though plants may die to the ground in Zone 5-6 winters, the roots often survive the winter and push up as much a 4-7' of new growth the following year. Because flowering appears on new growth, winter dieback or pruning back to the ground will not affect flowering. In the St. Louis area, this shrub is often regularly pruned close to the ground in early spring each year in somewhat the same manner as is also usually done with crape myrtles.
","

Culture
Best grown in slightly acidic, humusy, moderately fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Full sun is needed for best flowering. Can be invasive (rampant growth plus rooting surface runners). This vine needs space and a sturdy support structure on which to grow. It can be slow to establish. Although vines may produce flowers by the second or third year after planting, it may take much longer (sometimes up to 15 years). Plants grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Needs regular pruning(s) in order to control size and shape of the plant and to encourage flowering, such as a pruning back of stems (a) in early summer after bloom and (b) in winter. Root pruning in late fall may also stimulate flowering for the following spring. Improper pruning may overly stimulate vegetative growth at the expense of flowers. Consult a pruning guide for specifics on the initial training of vines and the types of pruning that can or should be done for these high maintenance plants. An application of superphosphate in early spring can also help stimulate flowering. Choose growing sites wisely because plants dislike being transplanted.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Wisteria sinensis, commonly called Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous vine that grows vigorously to 25’ or more and features 6-12” long racemes of mildly-fragrant, pea-like, blue-violet flowers in May when the foliage is just beginning to expand. Flowers bloom somewhat simultaneously on the racemes thus producing a dramatic floral display. Flowers give way to pendant, velvety, bean-like seed pods (4-6” long) which ripen in autumn and may persist into winter. Compound, odd-pinnate, deep green leaves (each leaf typically with 7-13 leaflets). In contrast to the very similar Japanese wisteria (Wisteria floribunda), Chinese wisteria differs by counterclockwise twining, fewer leaflets per leaf, shorter flowering racemes of less fragrant flowers that bloom simultaneously on each raceme and blue violet flower color. Over time, the stems of this vine become twisted, trunk-like and massive.Genus name honors Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania.Specific epithet means Chinese.
","
Problems
Although susceptible to a number of foliage-chewing insects and fungal diseases, none are significant. It is considered to be a high maintenance plant, however, because of its need for regular pruning, its invasive tendencies and its vulnerability to late spring frost damage to flower buds. Failure of vines to produce flowers may be attributable to a number of causes including death of flower buds in winter, too much shade, plants too young (especially seed grown ones), improper pruning or overfertilization.
","
Garden Uses
Plan ahead when planting this vine. It must be sited and trained only on sturdy structures which will be able to support the considerable weight of the mature vine. This is an excellent vine for large, sturdy, freestanding arbors, pergolas, posts, trellises, fences or terrace walls, and can be particularly effective when grown near or above patios where the flowers can be enjoyed in season. May also be trained as a specimen shrub or tree.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Yucca brevifolia, commonly known as Joshua tree, is a large, slow-growing, evergreen, tree form yucca native only to the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. It is found growing at elevations between 1,600-7,200' on open, rocky grasslands where they visually dominate the landscape. Mature individuals usually reach around 15-30' tall (sometimes to 50' or more) with an open, rounded canopy of equal width. The average lifespan of a Joshua tree is estimated at 150 years, but older trees exceeding 300 years old have been recorded. Younger plants lack the distinctive branching of older specimens. The stiff, narrow, tapered leaves (between 6-14"" long and 0.25-0.5"" wide) have terminal spines and small serrations along the margins. The foliage forms rosettes on the ends of the branches, and desiccated leaves remain on the plant covering the trunk and stems. The creamy white, round to ovate flowers (up to 2"" long and 1"" wide) are borne on terminal panicles (up to 20"" long). Light green seedpods (up to 4"" long) mature on the tree in clusters. In their native habitat, Joshua trees are an important source of food and shelter for wildlife. Many birds utilize the branches for nesting and perching. These include cactus wrens, northern flickers, and American kestrels. A single moth species called the yucca moth pollinates the flowers. Small mammals such as antelope squirrels and kangaroo rats eat the seeds. Joshua trees were also used by the Cahullia people of inland southern California as a source of food and fibers.Genus name comes from the Carbi name for manihot, also called cassava or yuca, which is not closely related but has similarly enlarged root structures.The specific epithet brevifolia means ""short leaves"", in reference to the length of the foliage relative to other yuccas.According to commonly held legend, the name Joshua tree was given by Mormon settlers and refers to the biblical tale of Joshua guiding the Israelites in the battle for Ai with an outstretched arm.

Culture
Corn is a warm weather crop and should not be planted until the soil warms up to 60° F. It is one of the taller home garden crops, so locate it where it will not shade out other crops. Plant in full sun, in fertile, well-drained soil. Several rules apply to insure an adequate corn crop:
1. Corn is wind pollinated, and to insure adequate pollination, sow seeds in several rows to form a square, or on hills with several plants in a circle. A minimum of 12 or more plants is usually necessary. Do not plant in one long row.
2. Corn is a heavy feeder and must have ample nitrogen and water at all times, but water the soil, not the plant or pollination could suffer. 
3. Corn roots do not tolerate disturbance well, so when thinning corn, cut the excess sprouts instead of pulling them. Do the same with nearby weeds and after corn is established mulch to reduce weeds rather than cultivating around their roots and damaging them.
4. Some sweet corns can be adversely affected by cross pollination from other corn varieties, so follow cultivar label directions precisely to avoid pollen contamination from other corn.
5. Time of harvest is important for some sweet corns, so follow harvest directions carefully for the particular variety you are growing. Hard corns need to dry on the stalk, so harvest time is not a particular issue for them.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Today, botanists generally agree that a wild grass, teosinte (Zea mexicana) is the ancestor of modern corn, originating by human selection sometime between 13,000 and 6,000 BC. Teosinte can ‘pop’ just like today’s popcorn varieties, it shares a similar life cycle with corn, and is easily crossbred, indicating significant genetic similarities with corn. Archeological excavations in Southern Mexico have revealed maize cobs (radiocarbon dated at around 5,000 BC) with features intermediate between wild teosinte and maize. By 3,000 BC, while Mesoamericans had domesticated a number of other food plants as well, maize appeared to be of increasing importance. With other domesticated plants, maize permitted more and larger permanent settlements and provided an important element in the subsequent cultural flowering in later Mesoamerica.

Columbus’ is credited with bringing maize to Spain on his return voyage in 1493. Its cultivation spread quickly in the early 1500s, and fairly quickly reached worldwide distribution, achieving status as one of the most climatically adaptable members of the grass family. While there are hundreds of corn varieties today, virtually all fall under six major categories: (1) sweet corn, (2) popcorn, (3) genetic dwarf of midget corn, (4) broom corn, a decorative corn grown for long fibrous tassels, (5) dent corn, the principle hard corn grown for animal consumption, and (6) multi-colored flint or Indian corn. Today, corn is one of the world’s three most important cereal crops for human and domestic animal consumption.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another cereal.Specific epithet comes from the Mexican vernacular name for maize.
","
Problems
The most common pests include corn borers, flea beetles, and cutworms. Animal pests can be serious once ears develop. Clean garden practices, crop rotation, and planting resistant strains are generally the best defense.
","
Garden Uses
As one of the most important food crops, corn is grown for both human and domestic animal consumption. It is valued in the home garden for its superior flavor compared to that of store-bought. Corn is also used ornamentally in seasonal decorations.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates some light shade, but turf becomes thinner as the amount of shade increases. Tolerates heat, drought and a wide range of soils. Mow regularly to a height of 1"" to 2"" tall. Fertilize moderately during the growing season (May to July). Zoysia lawns may be established vegetatively by sod, sprigs or plugs. Sprigs and plugs are best planted in mid to late spring. Sod may be laid as late as early September. In addition, some cultivars grow well from seed. This grass goes dormant after fall frost and remains tan/brown throughout winter.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies balsamea, commonly called balsam fir, is native to moist woods and bottomlands from Labrador to Alberta south to northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, New England, New York and further south in the Appalachians to Virginia.  It is a primary component of the boreal forest that stretches across Canada.  This is an aromatic, symmetrical, narrow, pyramidal to conical evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown.  It typically grows to 50-70' (less frequently to 90') tall and to 15-25' wide.  It appears, albeit in a diminished shrubby form, as far north as the timber line.  Resinous branches are densely clad with flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1"" long).  Needles are unstalked with circular bases and are white-banded beneath.  Smooth gray-brown bark (greenish when young but brown and scaly on older trees) is covered with blisters which contain a sticky aromatic resin.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 2-4"" long) appear at the crown.  Cones are purple when young.  As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.  Cones disintegrate (scales drop) after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet refers to the fragrant quality of the tree.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Insect pests include Balsam woolly adelgids, bark beetles, spruce budworms, aphids, bagworms and scale. Spider mites may occur in hot conditions.

Culture
Best grown in rich, medium moisture, slightly acidic, sandy/gravelly, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Established trees tolerate some soil dryness, but best performance usually comes with moist soils. Trees generally grow poorly in heavy clay soils. This tree thrives in areas with long winters followed by cool summer climates, and it usually does not grow well in the heat and humidity south of USDA Zone 7. It is, however, considered to be the best of the firs for tolerating the growing conditions of the Midwest.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies concolor, commonly called white fir or concolor fir, is primarily native to mountain slopes (3000-9000 feet in elevation) in the western U.S., including the southern Cascades and Sierras from Oregon to southern California and the Rockies from southern Idaho to Arizona and New Mexico. In the wild, it typically grows to 80-130’ tall, but on residential landscapes in the Midwest will more typically grow to 40-70’ tall with a spread to 20-30’. This is a narrow conical conifer with a straight trunk, spire-like crown and branching to the base. Upper branches tend to grow upward, but the lower branches tend to recline. With age, crowns flatten and lower branching begins to disappear. Soft, flattened, pale blue-green needles (to 2 1/2” long) have uniform coloration on both surfaces (specific epithet is in reference to this). Slightly barrel-shaped cones (to 3-6” long) are most often yellowish-green, maturing to brown or purple. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches. Trees may not produce cones and seeds for up to the first 40 years. Bark is ash-gray and smooth, but will furrow with age.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet means the same color throughout.

New growth in April is susceptible to damage from late spring frosts.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies firma, commonly called momi fir or Japanese fir, is a large, aromatic, conical-pyramidal, needled evergreen conifer that typically grows to 100-150’ tall in its native habitat.  It is likely to mature to a much smaller height (to 40-60’ tall) in cultivation in the U.S.  Branches on younger trees are ascending, but become more horizontal with age.  This fir is native to hills and mountain slopes in central to southern Japan from near sea level to about 6,000’ where it grows in a variety of locations on both dry and moist sites.  It is the most widely distributed fir in Japan where it is considered to be an important timber tree (flooring, crates, and paper pulp). 

Needles (to 1 1.5” long) are strongly two ranked, appearing like a 2-sided comb, forming a wide V shape on the lower twigs.  Needles on young trees are tipped by two sharp prickles at the apex.  Scaly, rough, fissured bark is gray, but becomes corky as it darkens with age.  Flowers appear in April-May.  Conical seed cones (to 3.5 to 5” long) emerge green in spring, but mature to yellowish-brown and are erect and showy throughout summer.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen, often leaving only the erect central spike of the cone axis.  Much smaller cylindrical pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to the firm needles.Momi is the Japanese word for fir.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies fraseri, commonly called Fraser fir, is native to a very small area of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee extending into the southwestern corners of Virginia and West Viginia. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 4500’ to 6900’. It is the only fir that is indigenous to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although rare in nature, Fraser fir is one of the most popular Christmas trees sold in commerce today, and is commonly grown in tree farms for that purpose. This is a narrow, pyramidal, evergreen conifer with a spire-like crown. It grows to 30-50’ tall over time with a spread of 10-25’. It is very similar to balsam fir (Abies balsamea), the primary difference being in the bracts of the cone scales. Flattened, shiny, dark green needles (to 1” long) are white-banded beneath. Needles are densely borne on resinous stems. Resin blisters may appear on the bark, giving rise to a regional common name of she-balsam for this tree. Seed cones are purple with conspicuously protruding bracts. As is distinctive with the firs, the cones appear upright on the branches.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet and common name honor John Fraser (1750-1811), Scottish botanist and plant collector, who discovered this plant and introduced it to Britain.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Abies grandis, commonly called grand fir, is a large, evergreen fir with a spire crown in youth that typically rounds into a multiple-leadered dome with age.  It is native to moist coastal bottomlands and alpine slopes from sea level to 6000’ in elevation in the Pacific Northwest from southwestern British Columbia south to northern California and in a disjunct population in the Rocky Mountains from southeastern British Columbia to central Idaho and far northwestern Montana.  It will grow to 200-250’ tall with a 4-6’ trunk diameter in Pacific coniferous forests and alpine slopes in coastal areas west of the cascades (greatest height is in coniferous rain forests on the Olympic peninsula of Washington), but to 130-160’ with a 2-4’ trunk diameter in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and in the Rocky Mountains.   This is one of the tallest firs in the world, hence the common name.  

Smooth gray bark develops ridges and furrows as it ages to brown.  Flat needles (to 2 1/2” long) are shiny dark green above with two white stomatal lines beneath.  Needles have blunt to slightly notched tips.  Needles emit a balsamy, tangerine-like aroma when crushed, hence the additional common name of stinking fir for this tree.  Cylindrical seed cones (to 4.5” long) stand upright above the needles near the tips of the upper branches, emerging green in spring, but maturing to yellowish-brown sometimes tinged blue-gray to purple.  Oblong pollen cones (to 1 1/4"" long) droop from the leaf axils under the needles.  Pollen cones are pale yellow.  As is distinctive with the firs, the upright seed cones disintegrate (scales drop) in fall after the seeds ripen.Genus name is an ancient Latin name for a tree described by Pliny around 77 A.D.Specific epithet is in reference to large tree size.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Acacia koa, commonly known as koa, is a large, fast-growing, evergreen tree of the pea family that is native to the Hawaiian Islands where it typically matures to 50-80’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with a dense broad-spreading crown.  It is usually found in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 300’ to 7000’ on the larger Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and Hawaii).  It is the second most common tree in the Hawaiian Islands.  

Mature trees have stiff, dull green, sickle-shaped, evergreen phyllodes (to 6” long and 1” wide) rather than leaves.  Phyllodes are modified leaf stems that function as leaves.  The true leaves of this tree (each with 12 to 15 paired, twice compound, pea-like leaflets) are only found on juvenile saplings.  Pale yellow flowers with globose heads (each to 3/8” in diameter) bloom in axillary racemes over the outer part of the crown.  Bloom time depends upon a number of factors including elevation, weather conditions and soil moisture.  Flowers may appear year round in some locations or late winter to early summer in others.  Flowers give way to thin, flat, seed pods (about 3-7” long and 1” wide) which mature to brown.  Each pod contains around 12 seeds. 

Koa is the best known timber tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.  Early Hawaiians made long dugout canoes from the wood of tall trees.  Wood is currently used for a variety of other purposes including furniture, cabinets, veneers, wood carvings, musical instruments and picture frames.  Timber from this tree is sometimes called Hawaiian mahogany in honor of its decorative wood (beautifully grained in shades of red, golden brown and brown).  It is one of the most expensive woods in the world today (low supply translates into high cost).  Most commercial harvest of Koa trees is currently limited to the island of Hawaii.  Timber cutting, land clearing and introduced pests have contributed to the decline of this species in the Hawaiian Islands.Genus name come from the Greek name for Acacia arabica.Specific epithet is a native Hawaiian name meaning bold, brave and fearless.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problem. Koa moth can be destructive.  Watch for twig borers, fungi and koa wilt.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10 to 11. In its native area, it tolerates a wide range of soil conditions from acidic to slightly alkaline and will grow in sand, loam or clay. It has moderate drought tolerance and poor salt tolerance and will grow in full sun to part shade. In the St. Louis area, it must be grown in containers which can be placed outside on decks and patios during warm weather or it can be grown indoors year-round in an area that receives bright, indirect light. When placed outside, avoid direct afternoon sun. In winter, plants benefit from misting to maintain higher humidity levels, but do not spray flowers. They are relatively trouble free, but watch for mealybugs, red spider mites and scale. Prune severely to 4 to 8 inches in spring to encourage new growth and increased bloom; remove spent flowers. Indoors, keep soil moderately moist, but not soggy. Feed monthly from March to September.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acalypha hispida, commonly called chenille plant, is a beautiful flowering plant that has a long bloom period. The flowers, which droop in cattail-like pendent clusters up to 18 inches in length are bright red to deep pink. In zones 10 to 11 it is a vigorous, upright, coarse-textured shrub that usually attains a height of 5 to 6 feet that is commonly used as an accent, hedge, specimen or container plant. In St. Louis, it is a good container, hanging basket and greenhouse plant, when taken indoors in the fall. Its long period of bloom makes it a showy centerpiece for any tropical or subtropical garden. It features leaves that are 6 to 8 inches long, ovate and medium green.Genus name comes from the Greek name for nettles because of the nettle-like appearance of the leaves.Specific epithet means bristly in probable reference to the bristly nature of the leaves. Another common name for this species is bristly copperleaf.
","
Problems
For best indoor success, very high humidity should be maintained. Also, spider mites, mealybugs and scale may be a problem when grown indoors. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In St. Louis, grow in containers or baskets on decks, patios or rooftop gardens. It is a good plant for color and should be used as an accent for both color and texture in a container. Or, it can be grown year-round in a greenhouse or sun room giving the area a tropical feel.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer griseum, commonly called paperbark maple, is a small, deciduous, oval to oval-rounded tree with slender upright branching.  It is particularly noted for its exfoliating copper orange to cinnamon reddish/brown bark and its showy orange to red fall color.  It typically matures to 20-30 (40)’ tall.  It is native to mixed forests in central China.  Bark on the trunk and limbs is extremely ornamental because it peels into large curls which remain on the tree rather that falling to the ground, often in attractive contrast to the tan to rose-brown inner bark.  Each trifoliate leaf (3-5” long) features three coarsely toothed leaflets, with the middle leaflet being short-stalked.  Leaves are green above, but frosty blue-green to gray-green with fine hairs beneath.  Fall color varies, typically ranging from showy shades of orange and red to less spectacular shades of reddish-green to bronze green.  Ornamentally insignificant yellowish flowers bloom in April-early May in clusters (drooping cymes to 1” long) on pendulous downy stalks.  Flowers give way to winged samaras (to 1 1/4” long) with unusually large seeds.

E. H. (“Chinese”) Wilson brought this tree from China to England in 1899.  It was introduced in the U. S. shortly thereafter by the Arnold Arboretum.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word griseus meaning gray in reference to color of the leaf undersides.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils including poor dry ones. Intolerant of shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer negundo, commonly known as box elder, is a suckering, fast-growing, weak-wooded, medium-sized, deciduous tree that typically grows 30-50’ (less frequently to 70’) tall with an irregular rounded crown.  It is widely distributed throughout the U.S. except in Alaska and Hawaii.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams, river flood plains and low woods (Steyermark).  Although it is a maple and produces the familiar maple fruits (paired samaras), it differs from most maples by having odd-pinnate compound leaves (each with 3-5 toothed leaflets) and by being dioecious (separate male and female trees).  Leaves with three leaflets are most common, and these resemble poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).  Leaves are light to medium green, turning an undistinguished yellow in fall.  Greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendant clusters in spring on separate male and female trees. Flowers are not showy.  Female flowers give way to fruits (samaras) which mature in fall and often persist on the tree well into winter.  Fruiting can be abundant.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet comes from the Sanskrit and Bengali word nirgundi, which was used as negundo in the naming of Vitex negundo and later for this maple that has a leaf similar to that of Vitex negundo.The name box elder (sometimes boxelder) is in reference to a use of the wood for making crates and boxes and the supposed similarity of the leaves to those of elder (Sambucus). Leaves also resemble those of some ashes, hence the additional common name of ash-leaved maple.
","
Problems
This tree is a host for boxelder bugs, which do not harm the tree but can be a significant nuisance to homeowners if the tree is located near the home. Also susceptible to borers. Anthracnose, powdery mildew and canker are occasional disease problems. Weak-wooded branches may break in high winds or from the weight of ice/snow, sometimes severely damaging the shape of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Could be used as a shade tree. Generally recommended only for difficult corners of the landscape where other trees of superior ornamental value will not grow or in cold northern climates such as North Dakota where many deciduous shade trees are hard to grow. Male trees are generally considered to be superior landscape plants to female trees because they lack the messy flowers and somewhat unsightly seed clusters of the female trees.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer platanoides, commonly called Norway maple, is native to Europe. It has been widely planted in urban areas throughout much of the U.S. It is a medium-sized deciduous shade tree typically growing 40-50’ tall with a dense, symmetrical, rounded crown. Leaves (to 7” across) have five sharply pointed lobes and resemble those of sugar maple. Leaf stems exude a milky sap when cut. Fall color is usually an unremarkable yellow. Small yellow flowers in erect clusters (corymbs) appear in spring before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired seeds with horizontally spreading wings (samaras to 2” long).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means resembling platanus (sycamore), which is somewhat curious since the leaves of Norway maple do not really bear that much resemblance to sycamores.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt which is usually fatal. Shallow root system can crack or heave nearby driveways or sidewalks. Shallow surface roots can interfere with turf. Bark is susceptible to sunscald and cracking (frost cracks) in winter, particularly on younger trees. The thick canopy of leaves and shallow roots severely limits what can be grown within the drip line of the tree.
","
Garden Uses
Shade tree. Although once widely planted as a street tree, this use is not generally recommended in many areas now.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer rubrum, commonly called red maple, is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that is native to Eastern North America from Quebec to Minnesota south to Florida and eastern Texas.  It typically grows 40-60’ tall with a rounded to oval crown.  It grows faster than Norway and sugar maples, but slower than silver maple.  In northern states, red maple usually occurs in wet bottomland, river flood plains and wet woods, but in Missouri it typically frequents drier, rocky upland areas.  Emerging new growth leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit and fall color are red or tinged with red.  Quality of red fall color on species plants is variable.  Leaves (to 2-5"" long) have 3 principal triangular lobes (sometimes 5 lobes with the two lower lobes being largely suppressed).  Lobes have toothed margins and pointed tips.  Leaves are medium to dark green above and gray green below.  Flowers on a given tree are primarily male or female or monoecious and appear in late winter to early spring (March-April) before the leaves.  Fruit is a two-winged samara.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet of rubrum meaning red is everywhere in evidence: red flowers in dense clusters in late March to early April (before the leaves appear), red fruit (initially reddish, two-winged samara), reddish stems and twigs, red buds, and, in the fall, excellent orange-red foliage color.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids, leafhoppers, borers, scale and caterpillars.  Verticillium wilt attacks the vascular system and can be fatal.  Canker, fungal leaf spot and root rots may also occur.  Wind and ice may break some branches. Leaf hoppers can cause substantial damage.
","
Garden Uses
Plant as a specimen tree for the lawn, street or park. It is of note that this tree has a shallow, flattened root system that may buckle nearby sidewalks or driveways if planted too close.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharinum commonly known as silver maple gets its name from the silvery undersides of its leaves. This is one of the largest deciduous trees native to Missouri, typically growing to 50-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with a rounded open spreading crown. It is native to eastern and central North America where it typically occurs in moist to wet, sometimes mucky, often poorly drained soils on floodplains, along the edges of streams and rivers and in low woods. It is a fast-growing, somewhat graceful tree that formerly was a very popular urban landscape selection for lawns and streets, but has more recently fallen somewhat out of favor because of the proclivity of its weak-wooded limbs to split when stressed by high winds or ice/snow. Polygamous greenish yellow flowers bloom in clusters in early spring (March) before the foliage. Flowers give way to paired samaras (to 2” long) that mature in late spring. Bark is gray to brownish gray. Mature tree trunks and limbs develop a shaggy appearance as the bark develops long thin flaky scales that exfoliate at the ends. Deeply 5-lobed light green leaves (to 6” across) have silvery undersides. Fall color is usually unremarkable. Tree sap is sweet, hence the species name which comes from the Latin word for sugar, but syrups made therefrom are greatly inferior to those made from sugar maple (Acer saccharum).Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose and canker. Also susceptible to scale and borers. As with many fast growing trees, silver maple has weak brittle branches that are susceptible to breaking in high winds or when coated with ice/snow in winter. Shallow roots may damage nearby sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful large landscape tree. Weak wood is a concern. Perhaps best sited in areas of poor soil or low wet conditions where other stronger wooded trees will not grow.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acer saccharum commonly known as sugar maple is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which will typically grow 40' to 80' tall (sometimes to 100') with a dense, rounded crown. This tree is a main component of the Eastern U.S. hardwood forest and is one of the trees which is most responsible for giving New England its reputation for spectacular fall color. Medium green leaves (3-6"" wide with 3-5 lobes) turn yellow-orange in autumn, sometimes with considerable color variations. Fruit is the familiar two-winged samara. Sugar maples are long-lived trees which grow relatively slowly (somewhat faster in the first 35 years). Native Americans taught the early colonists how to tap these trees to make maple syrup which has now become a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and Canada. Excellent shade tree.  The sugar maple leaf is the national symbol of Canada.Genus name is the Latin name for a maple tree.Specific epithet means sugary in reference to the sweet sap. Saccharum is the genus name for sugarcane.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, anthracnose, cankers, leaf spot and tar spot. Also susceptible to aphids, borers and scale. Leaf scorch may be a problem in drought conditions. Has been frequently used as a street tree, but is generally intolerant of road salt, soil compaction and pollution.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent specimen tree for the lawn or parks with beautiful fall color. May be used as a street tree as long as it can be located on a street and in a location where road salt, soil compaction and pollution will not be significant problems.

Culture
Best grown in lean, dry to medium, well-drained sandy loams in full sun. Plants do well in average garden soils and tolerate poor soils as long as drainage is good. Plants also tolerate hot, humid summers and drought. If grown ornamentally, plants are best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Plant stems tend to flop, particularly in hot, humid climates such as St. Louis and/or if grown in moist, rich soils. Consider cutting back plant stems in late spring before flowering to reduce overall plant height. Cutting plants back to lateral flower buds after initial flowering will tidy the planting and encourage additional bloom. Plants may also be cut back to basal foliage after bloom. Divide clumps as needed (every 2-3 years) to maintain vitality of the planting. Plants spread aggressively by rhizomes and self-seeding, and can naturalize into substantial colonies if left unchecked.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Achillea millefolium, commonly called common yarrow, is a rhizomatous, spreading, upright to mat-forming perennial that is considered by many to be an aggressive weed. Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound corymbs (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens. Cultivars also extend the range of flower colors to include pinks, reds, creams, yellows and bicolor pastels.Genus name is in reference to Achilles, hero of the Trojan Wars in Greek mythology, who used the plant medicinally to stop bleeding and to heal the wounds of his soldiers.Specific epithet means thousand-leaved in reference to the foliage.Common yarrow has a large number of additional common names, including milfoil, thousandleaf, soldier’s woundwort, bloodwort, nose bleed, devil’s nettle, sanguinary, old-man’s-pepper and stenchgrass.
","
Problems
Stem rot, powdery mildew and rust are occasional disease problems. Plant stems are weak and lodge easily. If grown ornamentally, plants can develop into a tangled mass of stems and foliage by mid to late summer if not cut back. Strong summer rain storms with high winds can easily flatten exposed plantings. May spread somewhat aggressively.
","
Garden Uses
Cottage gardens, wild gardens, meadows, prairies and naturalized areas. Good fresh cut or dried flower.This species is generally considered to be too weedy for borders. Can be used as a flowering ground cover or lawn for sunny out-of-the-way areas (mow as needed with rotary mower on high setting).

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Plants perform well in both boggy conditions (including shallow standing water to 3-4” deep) and consistently moist garden soils. Never allow soils to dry out. Scorched leaf tips and withering leaves are often the first signs of drying soils. In water gardens, plants are typically planted in containers with water covering the crowns or in wet soils at the water’s edge. Plants appreciate some relief from hot summer sun (e.g., afternoon shade or filtered sun) when grown in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Plants will slowly naturalize by spreading rhizomes, but are not considered to be invasive. If grown in containers sunk below the water surface, plants will not spread. Plants are not considered to be reliably winter hardy in the northern parts of USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Acorus gramineus is commonly called grassy-leaved sweet flag. It is native to wetland areas of China, Japan, Korea, India, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines. It is a semi-evergreen, marginal aquatic perennial that features a grass-like tuft of narrow, linear leaf blades (1/4“ wide) that fan outward to 6-12” tall. Tiny, insignificant, yellow-green flowers bloom from spring to early summer on lateral, sedge-like flower spikes (spadixes to 2-4"" long). Flowers give way to very tiny, reddish, fleshy berries. Tufts will slowly spread over time by rhizomes to form a dense ground cover. Plants thrive in wet soils and are commonly grown in water gardens and boggy areas for foliage accent or ground cover purposes. Although it looks like a grass and its common name suggests a grassy appearance, grassy-leaved sweet flag is not a member of the grass family. Originally it was assigned to the arum family (which includes calla lily and jack-in-the-pulpit), but recently it has been transferred from arum to its own family called Acoraceae. Transfer from the arum family was in part done because plants in the genus Acorus do not have true spathes as are typically found in arum family members. Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek akoron used for Acorus calamus and Iris pseuodacorus.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word meaning grass.Foliage is sweetly fragrant when bruised (hence the common name of sweet flag).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Scorch will occur if soils are not kept consistently moist to wet.
","
Garden Uses
Mass as a ground cover in small areas of water gardens, along streams or ponds, bogs or in moist open woodland gardens. Helps control erosion on water banks. Also effective in rock gardens, border fronts, foundations or as small landscape accents as long as the soil moisture requirements can be met. This plant may be used in the landscape in somewhat the same situations as one might use those species of Carex that prefer sun/part shade.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Actinidia arguta, commonly known as hardy kiwi or tara vine, is a deciduous, fast-growing, twining woody vine that is typically grown for its attractive foliage and edible fruit.  It is native to woodlands, mountain forests, streamsides and moist locations in eastern Asia, China and Japan.  It grows to 25-30' or more, but growth is often so rampant that this vine, in its native habitat, may climb to as much as 100' into large trees.  Broad-ovate to elliptic deep green leaves (3-5"" long) emerge in spring, scented greenish-white flowers (to 3/4"" long) bloom in June and edible grape-sized smooth-skinned fruits (to 1 1/4"" long) mature in September-October.  Species plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants), with at least one male pollinator needed for fruit set on female vines. It tastes similar to, though slightly sweeter than, its larger-fruited relative, the true kiwi, Actinidia deliciosa, which can not be grown north of Zone 8.Genus name comes from the Greek word aktis meaning ray in reference to how the plant growth radiates like the spokes of a wheel.Specific epithet means sharply toothed or notched in reference to the toothed leaves.
","
Problems
No serious disease or insect problems.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 11. North of USDA Zone 11, plants should be grown in containers and overwintered indoors. In containers, desert rose is best grown in a loose, sandy or gravelly, well-drained soil mix in full sun. Plants have excellent heat tolerance. Apply regular moisture during periods of growth, but allow soils to dry between waterings. Regular applications of fertilizer in spring will help promote flowering. Plants can be left outdoors in sunny locations during the summer. As soon as temperatures begin to dip below 55 degrees F. in autumn, bring containers indoors to sunny but cool locations with reduced watering. Plants usually lose their leaves in winter and go into a dormancy-like period. For container plants, the best caudex usually develops from seed-grown plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adenium obesum, commonly called desert rose, is a thick-stemmed sparsely-leaved perennial succulent that is native to semi- arid, sub-Saharan regions of eastern and southwestern Africa plus the Arabian peninsula. In the wild, this plant will eventually rise to 6-9' tall, but will grow much smaller in containers. It forms a broad, swollen, often grotesque caudex (usually partially buried underground) from which rise twisted leafless gray-green to brown branches. Leathery, spirally-arranged, fleshy, ovate, gray-green leaves (to 4"" long) appear at the stem tips. Narrow, bell-shaped, salverform flowers (to 2"" across), each with five spreading lobes and five protruding stamens, are red, pink or rose with white to pale yellow throats. In the wild, flowers bloom in summer with some irregular continued bloom throughout the year. As houseplants, flowers typically bloom only in summer. Milky plant sap is poisonous.Genus name is the Latinized Arabic name aden used for Adenium obesum.Specific epithet means fat or succulent.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum capillus-veneris, commonly called southern maidenhair fern, is a deciduous, clumping fern with a drooping habit that grows to 12-18” tall and slowly spreads by short creeping rhizomes. It features bipinnate to tripinnate fronds with wiry, black stems that are distinctively arching to pendent. Small pinnae (each to 1/2” long) are fan-shaped, having wedge-shaped bases and irregular lobing at the apex. Sori (spores) appear in summer on the reflexed pinnae undermargins. In Missouri, this fern is typically found in moist ledges and crevices of dolomite bluffs and on boulders along streams and rivers in the Ozark Mountains and adjacent areas (Steyermark). It is similar in appearance to northern maidenhair fern (Adiantum pedatum), except among other things its fronds are unforked. Soft delicate finely textured foliage is attractive in woodland areas. This fern is native throughout the world in tropical to temperate regions including South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. In the U. S., it is uncommonly found throughout the southern states north to California, South Dakota and Ohio.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning hair (capillus) of Venus (veneris) as reflected by the sometimes used common name of Venus maidenhair fern for this species.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Best in bright but sun-dappled or filtered light in sheltered locations with good air circulation.  Part shade is better than full shade.  Container plants grown as houseplants should be placed near sunny windows but not in direct sun.  Foliage may scorch in full sun but growth will lose vigor in too much shade.  Water freely and evenly, but avoid overwatering.  Soils should never be allowed to dry out.  Mist foliage to increase humidity.  Best indoor daytime temperatures are around 70 degrees F., dipping to 60 degrees F. at night.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as rough maidenhair fern, is an evergreen to deciduous fern featuring bipinnate to tripinnate fronds (each to 14” long).  It typically grows in an arching foliage clump to 12-18” tall, spreading over time by wiry, short-creeping rhizomes to form small colonies.  Each frond is divided into narrow pinnae stemming from the center stem of the frond, with each pinna being clad with rough textured, oblong to fan-shaped, medium to dark green pinnules (leaf segments to 1/2” long).  Each pinnule has sori (spores) which appear in summer on the undermargins of the pinnules (6-14 sori per pinnule). This fern is native to shaded rainforest and open rocky sites, often found along rivers and banks, in Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands, tropical Asia and Africa.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the southern U. S. (Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Hawaii).  This fern tends to be deciduous when grown outdoors in temperate conditions of USDA Zones 8-10, but is semi-evergreen to evergreen when grown in semi-tropical to tropical conditions or indoors as a houseplant.  Juvenile foliage emerges showy pink in sharp contrast to the leathery dark green mature foliage, hence the sometimes used additional common name of rosy maidenhair fern.  Pink fronds gradually mature to dark green or bronze green.  Common name of rough maidenhair fern is in reference to its rough-textured foliage.Genus name comes from the Greek word adiantos meaning unwetted in reference to the water repellent foliage.Specific epithet comes from Latin hispus meaning hair in reference to the fronds having minutely hairy stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaves may scorch in direct sun.  Rhizome rot may occur in wet soils.  At the other extreme, fronds will die back quickly if soils are allowed to dry out.  Watch for aphids, mealybugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
This is a popular ornamental fern which may be grown outdoors in USDA Zones 8-10 (perhaps Zone 7 if mulched and sheltered in winter) in shaded areas of woodland gardens and/or in containers/hanging baskets in shaded patio areas.  North of Zone 8, it is usually grown indoors as a houseplant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in sun or shade. Perhaps best in part shade in the St. Louis area. Foliage will often scorch in hot, dry, full sun conditions. Tolerant of a wide range of soils. Flower heads may be removed to prevent self-seeding and to maintain appearance of the ground cover. Any unvariegated shoots which appear should also be removed as they tend to be more vigorous and can quickly take over a planting. If foliage declines in summer, plantings may be sheared by mowing on a high setting to remove the unsightly leaves and to stimulate new foliage growth. Spreads by underground stems (rhizomes) and can be quite aggressive. If not grown in self-contained areas, mechanical barriers may need to be installed to prevent unwanted spread of plants. This plant is considered invasive in certain areas of the United States. Check local laws before adding to your landscape. Commonly sold by nurseries in flats for covering large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called bishop's weed or goutweed is one of the most popular ground covers for quickly covering large areas. Will rapidly form a continuous mound of attractive foliage typically growing to 8"" tall with an indefinite spread. Unfortunately, once it gets going, it acts like the proverbial snowball going downhill and can be difficult to contain. Individual leaflets (to 3"" long) are oval and serrated. Tiny white flowers appear in flat-topped, dill-like inflorescences (umbels) which are typical of the parsley/carrot family. Flowers appear above the foliage in May-June, but are not particularly attractive and are often sheared off by gardeners where practicable.Genus name comes from the Greek words aix meaning ""goat"" and podion meaning ""a little foot"", in reference to the leaf shape.The specific epithet podagraria means ""snare of gout"", in reference to its traditional use as a treatment for gout.Common name is in reference to a former use of the plant in the treatment of gout. Also commonly called Bishop's weed in reference to the purported resemblance of the leaflet shape to that of a bishop's miter.'Variegatum' has basal foliage that is light green with creamy white margins. It is less aggressive than the species but plants may revert back to the species with all green leaves and greater vigor. To retain the variegated form, remove any plants that revert.
","
Problems
Leaf blight is a somewhat common disease which is particularly troublesome in hot and humid summer climates. Foliage often declines by mid-summer to the point where mowing on a high setting is needed to revitalize a planting. This plant is an aggressive spreader and is considered invasive in certain areas of the United States. Check local laws before adding to your landscape.
","
Garden Uses
Avoid use of this plant in any mixed planting with other perennials such as in a rock garden or border. Best in a pure, contained planting (surrounded by natural or installed barriers) where it can be allowed to grow and spread solely as a ground cover. Can be quite effective when grown in the shade of trees or large shrubs.

Culture
Although this evergreen agapanthus may be planted in the ground in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10, it is best grown in tubs or containers in the St. Louis area (Zones 5b-6a) where it is not winter hardy. This is a tender perennial that grows from a fleshy-rooted rhizome. For container plants, plant rhizome 1/2"" below soil surface, keep soils consistently moist and provide moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer). Plants bloom best when roots are pot-bound. Site containers in locations with afternoon shade. In fall prior to the first frost, remove containers to a bright, frost-free location for overwintering. Provide very limited water in winter (just enough to keep leaves from drying/wilting). Return containers outdoors in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agapanthus africanus, commonly called lily-of-the-Nile, is native to South Africa (not the Nile River as the misleading common name suggests). It is an evergreen species that produces rounded clusters (umbels) of blue, funnel-shaped flowers atop stiff, upright, leafless, fleshy stalks (scapes) typically rising 18-24"" tall above a dense mound of basal narrow, strap-shaped, linear, grass-like leaves. Blooms in summer. Foliage mounds are attractive when plants are not in bloom. White cultivars also available.Genus name comes from the Greek words agape meaning love and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means of Africa.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agastache foeniculum, commonly known as anise hyssop, is an upright, clump-forming perennial of the mint family that is native to parts of the upper Midwest and Great Plains (Wisconsin to Ontario west to British Columbia and south to Colorado). It is typically found in prairies, dry upland forested areas, plains and fields. It grows to 2-4' tall. It is noted for its mid- to late summer bloom of lavender to purple flowers in terminal spikes and its anise-scented foliage. Square stems are clad with ovate to broad-lanceolate dull green leaves (to 4"" long) with toothed margins. Flowers appear in many-flowered verticillasters (false whorls) which are densely packed into showy, cylindrical, terminal flower spikes (3-6"" long). Gaps sometimes appear along the flower spike. Individual, tiny, tubular, two-lipped flowers (each to 1/3"" long) have no fragrance. Flowers are attractive to bees (good nectar plant), hummingbirds and butterflies. Aromatic leaves can be used to make herbal teas or jellies. Seeds can be added to cookies or muffins. Dried leaves can be added to potpourris.Genus name comes from the Greek words agan meaning very much and stachys meaning an ear of wheat in reference to the flower spikes.Specific epithet comes from a Latin meaning hay.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave americana is a rosette-forming perennial succulent that is native to Mexico.  It has been introduced and has naturalized in a number of tropical areas around the world.  Each plant typically forms a large, evergreen basal rosette of thick, succulent, lanceolate, gray-green leaves.  Each rosette typically matures over time to as much as 6' tall by 8-10' wide.  Each leaf has a waxy bloom, spiny tip, and sharp marginal spines.  This plant is also well-known for its infrequent but spectacular flowering spikes.  Plants are monocarpic (bloom only once and then die).  Common name of century plant suggests the plant will live 100 years before flowering.  In reality, outdoor plants typically bloom between the 10th and 25th years.   Indoor plants rarely flower.  When an outdoor plant blooms, it sends up a single, stout, erect flowering stalk from the center of the basal rosette of leaves to 15-30' tall or more.  The flowering stalk resembles a narrow telephone pole with horizontal branching near the top.  Greenish-yellow flowers (each to 3-4"" long) bloom in panicles at the branch ends.  Suckers/offsets root at the base of each rosette over time, often forming a colony of new plants.  Once a plant flowers and dies, the offsets around the base of the plant continue to grow.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet means of America.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Agave weevil can be troublesome.  Slugs and snails may damage foliage.   Root rot may occur, particularly in poorly-drained or overly-moist soils.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this agave serves as an interesting tropical accent or specimen.   It is a large and showy plant for the landscape.  It needs a large space in which to grow.  Plants are often grown in cactus or succulent garden areas.  It will grow well in containers as an indoor plant at a much smaller size.

Intolerant of frosts particularly when temperatures dip below 28 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Agave attenuata, commonly called century plant, is a rosette forming perennial succulent that is native to the plateaus/mountains of central Mexico. It is perhaps most noted for its attractive leaves and its huge drooping flower stems. Spineless, fleshy, ovate, light gray to pale yellowish-green evergreen leaves (to 28” long) form a large symmetrical rosette. Suckers/offsets root at the base of the rosette forming over time a colony of rosettes. With age, a stem/trunk to 3’ long may develop, with the trunk becoming visible as the older leaves of the rosette fall off. Each rosette will flower only once, usually when the plant reaches about 10 years old. The “flower” is a huge recurving raceme to 5-10’ tall with small, drooping, densely-packed, yellow-green to white flowers. Flowers are followed by seed pods. The rosette dies after flowering, but suckers/offsets at the base remain as new plants. Additional common names for this plant include lion’s tail, swan’s neck and foxtail. Plants may be grown outdoors in parts of California, southern Texas and southern Florida.Genus name comes from the Greek word agauos meaning admirable or noble in probable reference to the very tall flower spikes found on the plants of many species of Agave.Specific epithet refer to the gradual reduction of the leaf as it tapers to a slender point.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers rich soils with good drainage and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Plants tend to wilt quickly if soils are allowed to dry out. Tolerates light shade, and prefers some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates. In climates where powdery mildew is a problem, avoid overhead watering and site in areas with good air circulation. Ageratums are easily grown from seed. Seed may be started indoors in late winter and transplanted outdoors after threat of frost has passed. Seed may also be sown directly in the garden after last frost date, however flowering season will be shorter (late summer to frost). Seeds are tiny and difficult to work with, particularly for direct outdoor plantings. For gardeners who do not wish to use seed, live plants are available from many nurseries in cell packs/six packs and flats. Space taller varieties 12” apart and shorter varieties 6” apart. Spent flowers will fall to the ground as they fade to be replaced by new bloom throughout the growing season. Prompt deadheading of the faded flowers is not necessary, but keeps a planting tidy and tends to promote a better uninterrupted bloom. Plants may not bloom to frost in some hot summer climates, but usually do so in cooler ones. First autumn frost will kill most if not all plants, at which point they may be removed from the garden.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ageratum houstonianum, commonly called floss flower, is a frost-tender annual of the aster family that provides continuous bloom for beds, gardens or containers from late spring to frost. Features fluffy flowers (basically asters with ray flowers absent) in flattened to slightly rounded clusters atop compact, mounded plants generally ranging from 4” to 18” tall. Some taller varieties (e.g., the triploid ‘Blue Horizon’) are more erect and grow to as much as 30” tall. Species flowers are medium blue, however many cultivars are available in commerce in various shades of blue, pink, red, white and bicolor. Leaves are typically rounded, cordate-at-the-base, hairy, slightly quilted and soft green. Taller varieties make good cut flowers.Genus name presumably comes from the Greek a meaning not and geras meaning old age  because the flowers hold their color for a long time.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids and whiteflies. Powdery mildew is an occasional problem, particularly in hot and humid climates where soils are kept on the dry side and air circulation is poor. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Taller plants usually benefit from some support.
","
Garden Uses
Shorter varieties are excellent as bedding plants, edgers (along paths, walkways and border fronts) and container plants (hanging baskets, window boxes, urns or other containers). Also effective in rock gardens. Taller varieties are appropriate for mid-borders or cutting gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils with good drainage, but tolerates moderately dry ones. Will grow in full shade, but best foliage color usually occurs in part-sun locations (at least 3-4 hours of sun per day). Provide good air circulation in hot and humid areas where crown rot is a problem. Divide plants if they become overcrowded. This low-growing bugleweed will spread in the garden by stolons (reptans means creeping) to form an attractive, mat-like ground cover. Plants may be cut back to the ground after flowering, if necessary, to rejuvenate the foliage. Large plantings may be mowed on a high mower setting to remove spent flower spikes and to tidy the appearance of the planting. Space plants 6-9” apart for prompt cover. On variegated forms promptly remove any non-variegated leaves that may appear.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ajuga reptans, commonly called bugleweed, is a dense, rapidly spreading, mat-forming ground cover which features shiny, dark green leaves. Whorls of tiny, blue-violet flowers appear in mid to late spring on spikes rising above the foliage to 10"". Cultivars of this species feature leaves with more interesting and varied foliage color. When in full flower, large clumps of bugleweed can produce a striking display. Dense foliage will choke out weeds. Not particularly tolerant of foot traffic.Genus name origin is unclear.Specific epithet means creeping.
","
Problems
Crown rot can be a problem, particularly in the humid conditions of the deep South and in heavy soils. Avoid planting in wet, heavy soils, provide good air circulation and divide when clumps become overcrowded. Also avoid planting near perennial beds or lawns where its spreading nature could pose removal problems.
","
Garden Uses
Primary use is as a ground cover. Will fill in large, shady areas where lawns are difficult to establish. May also be planted on banks or slopes, under trees or around shrubs. Can be planted over spring bulbs such as snowdrops (Galanthus). Avoid planting adjacent to lawn areas since little islands of ajuga may start appearing in the grass. Good for small spaces, containers and rock gardens.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Akebia quinata, commonly called fiveleaf akebia, is a deciduous, twining, woody vine that rapidly grows to 20-40’. It produces compound palmate leaves, each with 5 elliptic to oblong-obovate leaflets (1-3” long) which are dark green above and glaucous below. Small chocolate-purple flowers bloom in drooping axillary racemes in spring. Flowers are monoecious, with both staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers appearing in the same raceme. Flowers are often hidden by the foliage, but are quite interesting on close inspection and have a pleasant fragrance. Flowers give way to sausage-shaped, violet fruit pods (to 4” long) which split open in fall to reveal small black seeds imbedded in a whitish pulp. The whitish pulp is edible. Native to China, Korea and Japan, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized in parts of the eastern U.S. Sometimes commonly called chocolate vine.Genus name is the Latinized version of the Japanese name akebi for these twining shrubs.Specific epithet means having five parts, in reference to the five-leaflet palmate leaves.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Albizia julibrissin, commonly called mimosa or silk tree, is a fast-growing, small to medium sized, deciduous tree that typically grows in a vase shape to 20-40’ tall with a spreading, often umbrella-like crown.  It is native to Asia (Iran to Japan).  It has been widely planted in the U. S. as an ornamental and has escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas of the southeastern U. S. and California.  In the wild, it is typically seen growing in vacant lots, waste areas, clearings, wood margins, fields and along roads.  It can be quite invasive in watersheds where water currents carry and distribute the seeds downstream.  It is noted for its bipinnate compound dark green leaves (to 20” long).  Each leaf has 10-25 pinnae, with each pinnae having 40-60 tiny leaflets (to 1/4” long).  Leaves have a fern-like appearance.  Fluffy, pink, powder puff flowerheads cover the tree with a long summer bloom.  Flowers are fragrant and attractive to bees.  Flowers give way to flat bean-like seed pods (to 7” long) which persist into winter.  Sensitive leaflets close up when touched and at night.  Leaflets fall to the ground after frost, producing no fall color.Genus name honors Filippo degli Albizzia, 18th century Italian naturalist, who introduced the genus to Italy in 1749.Specific epithet comes from the Persian word gul-ebruschin meaning floss silk in reference to the flowers.
","
Problems
Wilt is becoming a serious problem in many areas. Also susceptible to mimosa web worm.  Self-seeding can produce numerous seedlings.  Falling leaves, flowers and seed pods can pose significant clean-up problems if trees are planted near homes.  Weak wooded limbs are susceptible to damage from strong winds and ice/snow.
","
Garden Uses
Generally considered to be an attractive but inferior landscape tree.  May be used as a lawn accent in areas where soils are poor or alkaline.  Avoid planting in areas where wilt is a problem.

Foliage features large, heart-shaped (3, 5 or 7 lobes), rough lower leaves which become progressively smaller toward the top of the spire. Long bloom period of June to August. Sometimes listed in nursery catalogs under Althaea.Genus name is the Latin name from the Greek word alkaia for a kind of mallow.Specific epithet means pink.
","
Problems
Foliage is susceptible to rust, leaf spot and anthracnose. Spider mites and Japanese beetle can also be problems. Foliage can become rather tattered and unkempt in appearance when attacked by the aforementioned insects and/or diseases, but the flowers generally are not affected. May need staking, particularly if not protected from wind.
","
Garden Uses
Hollyhocks provide excellent architectural height, contrast and a certain amount of old world charm to cottage gardens and border backgrounds. Also effective when grown against walls or fences.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade, but tolerates close to full shade.  Prefers part afternoon shade in hot summer climates.  Performs well in moist garden areas. Freely self-seeds in the garden to the point of being somewhat invasive in optimum growing conditions.  Prompt removal of spent flower stems will not only prevent self-seeding but may also encourage a sparse, late summer rebloom.  Plants may be grown from seed started indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  Divide plants as needed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alchemilla mollis, commonly known as lady’s mantle, is a clumping perennial which typically forms a basal foliage mound (6-12” tall ) of long-stalked, circular, scallop-edged, toothed, pleated, soft-hairy, light green leaves (to 6” across) each with 9-11 shallow rounded lobes.  It is primarily native to mountain areas in eastern Europe (Carpathians, Caucusus and Turkey).  Tiny, apetalous, star-shaped, chartreuse flowers appear in loose, spreading clusters (compound cymes) atop stems rising above the foliage to 12-18” in late spring to early summer.  The tendency of plant leaves to retain moisture beads after a rain is considered to be a unique and attractive ornamental feature.Origin uncertain, perhaps the Latinized version of an Arabic name.Specific epithet means soft.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium cernuum, commonly called nodding wild onion, is a Missouri native plant which occurs primarily in rocky soils on glades, bluff edges, open woods and slopes in the Ozark region of the State. Plants typically grow 12-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall. Features clumps of flat, narrow, grass-like leaves (to 12” tall) and tiny bell-shaped, pink to lilac pink (occasionally white) flowers which appear in loose, nodding clusters (umbels) atop erect, leafless scapes rising slightly above the foliage. Wild nodding onion is distinguished from most other native alliums by the fact that its scapes crook sharply downward at the top just below the flower so that the flower umbel nods (hence the common name). Blooms in summer. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, nodding onion is not generally considered to be of culinary value today.

Specific epithet means nodding.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means nodding.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium fistulosum, commonly called spring onion, Welsh onion, or Japanese bunching onion, is a clumping, slowly-spreading, evergreen perennial onion that is primarily grown as a vegetable for harvest of its tasty onion-flavored leaves.  Elongated underground bulbs are barely thicker than the plant stem (some characterize this species as being “bulbless”).  Hollow, leafless, blue-green flowering stalks rise to 24-36” tall, each stalk being topped by a globular terminal umbel (to 3” diameter) containing tiny, yellowish-white, 6-tepaled flowers.  Each umbel typically sports 50-100 flowers which bloom from late May to August.  Hollow, basal green leaves are linear with entire margins, parallel venations and glabrous surfaces.  

This bunching onion was developed in Asia from a wild relative native to China.  It was brought to Europe in the 17th century.  The original Chinese plant may be extinct in the wild.  This onion has been extensively cultivated since ancient times.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in Alaska and in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word fistulosus meaning hollow in reference to the stems and leaves.Common name of Welsh onion does not refer to the country of Wales, but is derived from the German word walsch meaning foreign.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Bulb rot may occur in overly moist soils.  Slugs attack young plants.  Mildew, rust and leaf spots may appear.  Watch for onion maggots and thrips.
","
Garden Uses
Widely used as a food additive in salads, garnishes, soups, stews, stir fry and Chinese cooking.  Also serves as a chive/leek substitute.  May be grown in herb gardens and vegetable gardens where the young leaves and bulbils may be harvested for food.  Leaves are tasty when young, but are not ornamentally attractive.  Flowering stalks are ornamentally attractive when flowers are in bloom.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  In the St. Louis area, bulblets (cloves) are best planted in fall but need the protection of a good winter mulch (e.g., straw).  In very cold winters, the bulblets may not survive.  Bulblets may also be planted in early spring.  Fall plantings generally produce larger bulbs for harvest.  Plant bulblets 2” deep and 6"" apart with the pointed end up in rows 1-2' apart.   Harvest in late summer after most of the leaves have turned yellow-brown and begin to fall over.  Dry bulbs for several days before storing in a cool, dry location.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium sativum, commonly called garlic, is a bulbous perennial of the onion family.  It is native to the Mediterranean area.  Foliage consists of aromatic, linear, flattened, grass-like green leaves.  In some varieties, a central scape topped by an umbel of pinkish-white flowers rises from each clump of leaves to 18” tall in summer.  Garlic is typically grown as an annual in herb and vegetable gardens for its segmented bulbs which are commonly used in cooking.  

Garlic comes in two varieties:  hardneck (designated as Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon) and softneck (designated as Allium sativum var. sativum).  Hardneck varieties typically produce a flower stalk, with flowers giving way to a seed cap.  Each bulb typically contains 4-10 cloves (bulb is smaller but cloves are larger than those of softneck).   Hardneck varieties come in three different types:  Rocambole, Poreclain and Purple Stripe.  By contrast, softneck garlic plants typically do not produce a flower stalk.  They produce bulbs with smaller but more numerous cloves than hardneck garlic plants.  Each bulb typically contains 12-20 cloves.  Softneck plants are also braidable (bulbs can be braided together into attractive chains by weaving the soft grass-like tops together).  Softneck garlic varieties are the ones most often commonly sold in supermarkets because they typically have a much longer shelf life than hardnecks.   Softneck varieties come in two different types:  Silverskin and Artichoke.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means cultivated.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Allium sphaerocephalon, commonly called round-headed leak or drumstick allium, is a bulbous perennial that is ornamentally grown for its early summer bloom of rose-purple to pink flower heads. This plant is native throughout Europe to the Caucusus, Iran and northern Africa. Cylindrical, hollow, grassy, gray-green leaves to 14"" long form a foliage clump in spring. In late spring, sturdy slender flowering stems rise to 24-36"" tall topped with egg-shaped flower heads (umbels to 1"" wide) in an impressive early summer bloom (June-July in St. Louis). Each flower head is a tight, dense, clover-like cluster of tiny florets that emerge deep green but mature (top to bottom) to rose-purple. Each flower head displays an interesting bi-color effect as the florets change from green to purple. This species blooms later than most of the alliums. Flower heads resemble the flower heads of some clovers. Flowers lack fragrance. Bulbils sometimes form after flowering. Leaves and bulbs have an onion-like aroma when cut or bruised.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Clethra tomentosa, commonly called summer sweet, is a deciduous shrub that is native to damp woods, swamps, wet marshes and stream banks, often in sandy soils, in the southeastern U.S. from North Carolina to Florida west to Louisiana.  It is a rounded, suckering, densely-branched shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ (less frequently to 8’) tall.  Young shoots and young leaf surfaces are woolly-tomentose.  It is noted for producing a mid to late summer (mid-July to September) bloom of sweetly fragrant white flowers which appear in drooping, narrow panicles (racemes to 2-6"" long).  Each inflorescence has 2-4 flowering racemes.  Flowers give way to dark brown seed capsules (1/8"" diameter) which may persist into winter.   Mature stems have scaly, dark gray to brownish-black bark.  Serrate, obovate to oblong, glossy dark green leaves (to 3-4” long) turn variable but generally attractive shades of yellow to golden brown in fall.  Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and bees.  Semi-evergreen in warm winter climates.  

Clethra tomentosa was formerly listed as Clethra alnifolia var. tomentosum, but has somewhat recently been elevated to separate species status.   On a comparative basis, the characteristics of Clethra alnifolia var. tomentosum which were primarily considered in changing its listing to Clethra tomentosum include:  (1) flowers panicles are longer and more drooping, (2) petioles are consistently shorter, (3) new shoots are woolly, (4) styles are shorter and hairy, and (5) overall growth habit is more spreading.Genus name comes from the Greek klethra the name for alder of which the leaves resemble.Specific epithet from Latin means hairy in reference to the hairs found on the leaves and young shoots of this plant.‘Cottondale’ leaves are more tomentose than the species, thus lending a blue-green cast to upper surfaces and a light green cast to leaf undersides.  Flower racemes are longer than those of the species, typically extending to as much as 16” long”.  This cultivar was discovered growing in the Florida panhandle and was subsequently introduced into cultivation by Woodlanders.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Spider mites may be a concern in dry conditions.

Garden Uses
Summer sweets are somewhat unique among flowering shrubs because of their ability to bloom in shady locations in late summer when few other shrubs are in bloom.  Mass or group in lawns, foundations or shrub borders.  Good flowering shrub for shade or woodland gardens.  Effective as a hedge.  Also appropriate for moist soils along stream banks or pond/water garden peripheries.  Also may be naturalized in cottage gardens, wild gardens or naturalized areas.  Plant near a patio to enjoy the fragrant late summer bloom.  Compact size makes this an ideal flowering shrub for smaller gardens.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Aloysia citriodora, commonly called lemon verbena is native to Argentina and Chile. It is a woody shrub that produces shiny lanceolate green leaves (to 3-4” long) that have a strong aroma (without crushing) and taste of lemon. Leaves are opposite or in whorls of three (hence the specific epithet). Plants will grow to 10-15’ tall in the tropics, but to 2-4’ tall in containers. Fragrant, white to pale lilac flowers bloom from mid-summer to early fall, but have little ornamental significance. Container plants may not bloom. Plants are evergreen in tropical/warm winter locations but deciduous in areas where freezing temperatures occur. Lemon verbena has been a popular garden plant in warm southern and western parts of the U.S. for many years. Leaves are strongest at the time of flowering. Leaves and flowers are used for culinary purposes (teas, desserts, fruit salads and jams) for perfumes and cosmetics, for potpourris and as herbal medicines (colds, fevers, dyspepsia and diarrhea). Aloysia citriodora is synonymous with Aloysia triphylla, Lippia citriodora, Verbena citriodora and Verbena triphylla. Spanish explorers brought this plant to Spain in the 17th century at which point it was named after Princess Louisa of Parma (genus name is a version of Louisa and common name is Herb Louisa).Genus name honors Maria Louisa (d. 1819), princess of Parma and wife of King Carlos IV of Spain.Specific epithet means lemon-scented.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Some nurseries currently claim that shell ginger can be grown outdoors year-round in USDA Zone 7 with winter protection. Plants appreciate some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Soils must not be allowed to dry out. In St. Louis, this plant is often grown as a houseplant or in the greenhouse. As a houseplant, it must have bright light and humid conditions. Prune as needed to control plant size. It may also be grown outdoors in the garden, but rhizomes should be dug and stored indoors for winter in a dry medium (as vermiculite) in a cool room. Plants will not flower until the second year (flower on old growth), so if grown outdoors, either as annuals or for overwintering indoors, they generally will not flower and must be enjoyed only for their attractive foliage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alpinia zerumbet, commonly called shell ginger is native to eastern Asia. It is a rhizomatous, evergreen perennial that grows in upright clumps to 8-10’ tall. It more typically reaches 4-8’ tall in the greenhouse and 3-4’ tall as a houseplant. It is commonly called shell ginger because its individual shell pink flowers, particularly when in bud, resemble sea shells and its rhizomes have a ginger-like aroma. It is distinguished from other members of the ginger family by the fact that its flowers droop from the ends of leafy stems rather than rise directly from plant rhizomes. Waxy, light pink flower buds open to tubular flowers with yellow inside lips and red throats. Flowers are fragrant. Flowers appear in drooping racemes (to 1’ long) in summer. Lance-shaped green leaves to 2’ long and 5” wide.Genus name honors Italian botanist Prospero Alpino (1553-1616).

Culture
Tropical perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zone 10 and is grown exclusively for its colorful foliage. Grow in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best foliage colors are usually developed in full sun, however some bleaching of colors may occur in full sun in hot summer climates. In the St. Louis area, it is typically grown outdoors as an annual (e.g., ground cover, edger or in containers), but may also be grown indoors as a houseplant as long as it is sited in a bright, sunny location and soils are kept moist. Plants may be grown from seed by starting them indoors in late winter and transplanting them outdoors after last frost date. Quality of leaf color may vary considerably and only the best seedlings should be selected for inclusion in the planting. Plant 4-9” apart for ground cover effect. Pinching stems or shearing will keep plants compact and bushy. For those who do not wish to plant seed, some of the more popular varieties are available from nurseries in cell packs or flats. Smaller plants may be potted up and brought inside in winter. In the alternative, tip cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering indoors.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Alternanthera ficoidea is a low-growing plant that typically grows on erect to procumbent stems to 6-12” tall. It is native from Mexico to Argentina.; Species plants have elliptic to broad ovate green leaves (to 1” long). However it is the brightly colored cultivars that have become the popular garden plants, featuring green leaves blotched with yellow, orange, red, brown, copper or purple, sometimes with red veining. Foliage of the brighter colored cultivars is suggestive of coleus. White apetalous flowers appear stalkless or on short stalks in small axillary clusters in late fall to winter, but are insignificant. Flowers are usually observed in St. Louis only on houseplants or on container plants brought inside for overwintering. Plants in the genus Alternanthera have a rather large number of descriptive common names, including but not limited to Joseph’s coat, copperleaf, calico plant, bloodleaf, joyweed and parrot leaf, all in reference to the brilliantly colored leaves which provide foliage contrast to gardens and container plantings.Genus name comes from the Latin words alternans meaning alternating and anthera meaning anther. Alternate anthers in the genus are barren.Specific epithet means resembling fig (Ficus).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Andropogon gerardii, commonly called big bluestem grass, is a tall, Missouri native, perennial, warm season grass that was the dominant grass of the tallgrass prairie which once covered large parts of the Midwest. It may be grown as an ornamental grass because of its attractive foliage which changes color seasonally, its good architectural height and its interesting flower/seed heads. It features an upright clump of stems with flattened leaves (to 2' long and 3/8"" wide) which emerge gray to blue green in spring, mature to green with red tinges in summer and turn reddish bronze with lavender tones in autumn after frost. Flowering stems rise in late summer above the foliage clump bearing purplish 3-parted, finger-like flower clusters (to 4"" long) purportedly resembling turkey feet (hence the additional common name of turkeyfoot grass for this species). Flowering stems bring total height of this grass to 4-8' tall (typically at the taller end in moist soils and the shorter end in dry soils).Genus name comes from the Greek words aner or andros meaning man and pogon meaning beard in reference to the hairs on the spikelets of some species in the genus.Specific epithet honors Louis Gerard (1733-1819), French physician and botanist.

Culture
Dill is an annual that is best grown in rich, light, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants are more apt to fall over in part shade. Shelter plants from strong winds. Close-planting, stakes or cages may be used to provide support. Best growth occurs in cool summer climates. Plants appreciate consistent soil moisture. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Plants tend to bolt when conditions remain dry. Sow seed directly in the ground just before the last spring frost date. Seedlings can be difficult to transplant, so seeds are usually not started indoors. Additional seeds may be planted every two weeks until early summer for purposes of extending the time when fresh leaves may be harvested. Dill seed may be harvested by placing the seed heads in paper bags to dry about 2-3 weeks after flowering (this method will also help prevent self-seeding in the garden). In St. Louis, a patch of dill will usually self-seed and produce new plants each spring. Dill may also be grown in large containers (deep roots of dill need deep containers).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Anethum graveolens, commonly called dill, is an annual that is frequently grown in herb, vegetable and flower gardens not only for harvest of its aromatic leaves and seeds, but also for ornamental display of its attractive foliage and flowers. Although native to Asia Minor and the Mediterranean, dill has now been widely planted around the globe, with naturalization having occurred in parts of Europe and North America. Dill typically grows to 3-5' tall on stiff hollow stems clad with aromatic, lacy, delicate, blue-green leaves that are pinnately divided into fine, thread-like segments. Taller plants may flop and need protection from strong winds. Scented, yellow flowers bloom in mid-summer in large, flattened, compound umbels (each to 10"" diameter). Flowers are followed by aromatic seed. Leaves usually have the best flavor around the time when the flowers first open. Although leaves may be dried or frozen for later use, the leaves have by far the best flavor when harvested fresh from the garden. Dill attracts a number of beneficial insects to the garden (e.g., bees, wasps, butterflies, lacewings, tachinid flies, hover flies and lady beetles). Dill is a larval plant for the black swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek name for dill.Common name of dill reportedly comes from the norse word dilla meaning to lull or soothe. In colonial America, dill seeds were sometimes called meetinghouse seeds because they were on occasion given to children to chew during long church services.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Blight and aster yellows can cause significant damage. Watch for aphids and tomato hornworms.
","
Garden Uses
Commonly grown in herb gardens, vegetable gardens or flower borders. Also may be grown in containers. Dill leaves add subtle but distinctive flavor to a variety of dishes including fish, vegetables, soups, salads, sauces, breads, and herb butters. Dill seed is more pungent than the leaves and is the primary flavoring in dill pickles. Dill seed is also used in vinegars, sauerkraut and for flavoring root vegetables. Dill seed can be used to make an excellent tea. Flower heads are excellent in dried arrangements.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Annona muricata, commonly called soursop (also known as graviola or guanabana), is a small evergreen tropical tree that is native to Central and tropical South America.  In the wild, it is a slender tree that will grow to 15-20' tall often with down-curved branching.  It grows much smaller in containers.  The name soursop is in reference to its large edible fruits which have a slightly acidic or sour taste.  This tropical plant is not reliably winter hardy to most of southern Florida, but may be grown in the Florida keys and Puerto Rico.  In greenhouses, it typically flowers in summer producing fruits in fall.  Each flower (to 2"" long) appears singly on a woody stalk almost anywhere on the tree (twigs, branches or trunk).  Each flower has three yellowish-green outer petals and three dull yellow inner petals.  Flowers give way to rough-skinned, prickly-textured, oblong fruit (each fruit from 6-12"" long to 4-6"" wide with weight to 8-15 pounds).  Fruit pulp is used in ice cream, sherbets or juices.  Leathery, egg-shaped, malodorous (when bruised), oblong to oval leaves (to 6"" long) are glossy green above.  Plants have been used for various medicinal purposes.Genus name comes from the Latinized version of the American Indian (Taino) vernacular name for the cherimoya, soursop or custard-apple.

Prefers high humidity. Regular temperatures in summer and minimum 60F in winter. Frequent repotting (every 2 years) helps rid soils of unabsorbed minerals. Sphagnum moss on soil surface helps cover and keep moist any roots that appear. Insecticides may harm flowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Anthurium andraeanum, commonly called flamingo lily or painter’s palette, is native to Columbia and Ecuador. It is an epiphytic evergreen tropical perennial of the Arum family that is most noted for its attractive waxy, palette-shaped, bright red spathes and contrasting dark green foliage. It typically grows to 16” tall. Drooping, heart-shaped, dark green leaves (to 8” long) arise in a clump on long stems from the plant crown and are attractive year around. Each axillary flower (typical arum family) features a creamy yellow spadix enclosed by a large, flat, waxy red spathe (to 6”). Flowers are long-lasting. Flowers may appear throughout the year in optimum growing conditions. Fruits rarely appear on indoor plants.Genus name comes from the Greek words  anthos meaning a flower and oura meaning a tail referring to the tail-like spadix.

Culture
Short-lived tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-10. In St. Louis, it is usually grown as an annual. It is easily grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid overhead watering. Start seeds indoors 6-10 weeks before last frost date or purchase starter plants. Set out plants/seedlings after last frost date. Pinch stem tips of young plants to promote bushiness and prevent leggy growth. Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom. If flowering slows drastically after the first flush of bloom, consider cutting plants back hard and fertilizing. Although well-mulched plants in protected locations may overwinter in St. Louis and although cuttings may be taken in fall for overwintering, snapdragons are inexpensive plants that are perhaps best repurchased each spring. Nurseries commonly sell plants in cell/six packs. Always purchase fungal resistant plants/seeds. Snapdragons, like pansies, are often planted in fall south of USDA Zone 7 where they will not only survive the winter, but will bloom as long as temperatures stay above freezing.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Antirrhinum majus, commonly called snapdragon, is an old garden favorites that, in optimum cool summer growing conditions, will flower well from spring to fall. In climates with protracted hot summer weather, plants often tend to languish and may not last the entire growing season. The common name is in reference to the dragon-shaped, tubular, two-lipped, closed flowers that appear in terminal racemes. Many cultivars and hybrids in which A. majus is a prominent parent are available in commerce. Flowers come in a variety of both pastel shades and bright colors, including some bicolors, in shades of white, yellow, red, pink, orange, peach and purple. Lance shaped, glossy dark green leaves (to 3” long). Cultivars and hybrids generally are classified into three groups based upon height: dwarf plants (8-12” tall), intermediate plants (12-24” tall) and tall plants (24-36” tall).Genus name comes from the Greek words anti meaning like and  rhis meaning a nose or snout in allusion to the appearance of the flower which looks like a dragon's snout.
","
Problems
Rust can be a significant problem. If rust does appear in a planting, it is best to grow snapdragons in another part of the garden the following year. Also susceptible to mold, fungal leaf spots, downy mildew, wilt and root rots. Watch for aphids. Tall plants may need support when young until such time as they bush out.
","
Garden Uses
Dwarf varieties are best for beds, border fronts, edgings, window boxes and other containers. Intermediate varieties are best for bedding and mixed borders. Tall plants are best for borders and cutting gardens.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. When grown outdoors, this tree prefers deep, porous, moderately fertile, reasonably moist soils in full sun.  Tolerant of some dry soil conditions however.   Also tolerant of windy conditions.   May be grown from seed sown in moist, sandy, peaty soils, but seed-grown trees typically have widely-spaced tiers of leaves that are less ornamentally attractive than the leaves found on trees raised from terminal cuttings.  Best growth generally occurs in sub-tropical regions.  

For indoor use, this tree may be grown in containers or tubs in fertile, porous, sandy, peaty, slightly acidic, well-drained soils in fairly cool conditions (55-65 degrees F).  Full sun is normally best for developing compact symmetrical growth, but some light afternoon shade may be needed to avoid possible foliage bleach (yellow tints).  As a houseplant, it will generally adapt to the warm, dry atmosphere found in most offices and homes.  Consider weekly or biweekly applications of dilute liquid fertilizer from spring through fall.  Avoid soils that are too wet or too dry.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Norfolk Island pine is a pyramidal to columnar, coniferous, evergreen tree with a symmetrical form that features whorled, horizontal branches (typically 5 branches per whorl) in tiers radiating outward from a strong, single, upright trunk.  Secondary branches in two rows spread horizontally or droop slightly.  It is native to Norfolk Island off the coast of Australia where it typically grows on basalt sea cliffs and interior rain forests, sometimes reaching majestic heights of 200’ or more with trunk diameters to 6’ or more.  It was discovered on Captain Cook’s second voyage (1772-1775), and was subsequently introduced into cultivation in 1793.  It is now widely planted throughout the world in subtropical regions, often in coastal areas.  It is common in Hawaii, parts of southern Florida and parts of southern California up the coast to the San Francisco Bay area. 

Needle-like, awl-shaped juvenile leaves (each to 1/2” long) have incurved sharp-pointed ends.  Scale-like adult leaves (each to 1/4” long) are lanceolate to ovate-triangular, overlap each other and are closely arranged along the shoots pointing toward the shoot ends.  Cylindrical male pollen cones grow to 2” long.  Nearly globular, spiny-scaled, female seed cones grow to 3-6” in diameter. 

Norfolk Island Pine is now the most popular species in the genus in North America where it is commonly grown in pots and tubs as a decorative indoor plant. 

In St. Louis, it is grown as a container/tub plant, typically in the 3-6’ tall range.  It grows slowly, and in proper growing conditions has a long life.  It looks like a pine with horizontal needle-like branches, but it is not part of the pine genus.Genus name comes from the Araucanian Indians of central Chile to whose territory Araucaria is native.Specific epithet comes from Greek meaning variously leaved.

Grow in acidic, dry to medium, well-drained, sandy or gritty soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Usually grows well in poor infertile soils.  Plants should not be fertilized. Drought tolerant once established.  Likes exposed open sites.  Best grown in USDA Zones 2-6 (7).  Grows poorly in hot and humid summer climates, and is not recommended for planting in most areas south of USDA Zone 7.  Difficult to transplant from the wild.  Propagate by cuttings from the current season’s growth, by layering, by division (with care because roots dislike disturbance) or species plants by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, known by a large number of common names including common bearberry and kinninnick, is an extremely winter hardy, creeping, slow-growing, prostrate, woody evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-12” tall but spreads over time by flexible branching (roots at the nodes) to 3-6’ wide or more. This is a circumpolar ground-hugger which is native throughout the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia.  In North America, it is typically found in a variety of locations from Alaska to Newfoundland south through Canada to Virginia, Illinois, South Dakota, New Mexico and central California in a variety of habitats typically including gravelly and/or sandy exposed sites, dry/rocky slopes/outcrops, forest margins and forest clearings.  It is primarily confined to cool alpine regions in the more southern parts of its growing range (Appalachians in Virginia, Rockies in New Mexico and Sierras in California).  

Branchlets mature to reddish brown, with papery peeling bark on older twigs.  Branchlets are clad with alternate, entire, short-stalked, leathery, rounded-at-the-tip, obovate to spatulate, evergreen dark green leaves (each to 1 1/4” long) which are shiny above but paler beneath.  Leaves turn bronze in winter before becoming green again in spring.  Miniature, drooping, urn-shaped, white-to-pink flowers (to 1/4” long) in small terminal clusters bloom in April to May.  Rounded, berry-like fruits (drupes) ripen in August-September.   Each drupe (1/2” long) contains 5 nutlets (seeds).  Drupes are green in summer ripening to red in fall, sometimes remaining on the plants throughout winter.  Drupes are bittersweet raw off the plant, but sweeter when first boiled.  Fruits are technically edible for humans, but are generally considered to be mealy and lacking flavor.  Meriwether Lewis described these fruits in 1806 to be “tasteless and insipid.”  On the plus side, bears, birds and small mammals love the fruits.Genus name comes from the Greek words arctos meaning bear and staphyle meaning bunch of grapes in reference to the fruits (often in grape-like clusters) which are commonly eaten by bears.The specific epithet comes from the Latin words uva meaning grape and ursus meaning bear thus bear’s grape, also in reference to the fruits serving in the wild as bear food.  Bearberry nickname means the same thing, namely, that bears eat the fruits of this plant.One of the popular common names for this plant is kinnikinnick which is an Algonquin word meaning smoking mixture.  Native Americans and later early pioneers sometimes smoked the dried leaves of bearberry (alone or mixed with other leaves, tobacco and/or the dry inner bark of red osier dogwood) in pipes.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  If grown in poorly-drained sites or in climates hotter than preferred, this bearberry becomes more susceptible to certain diseases such as root rot, black mildew, leaf gall, leaf spot and rust.
","
Garden Uses
Moderate to large scale ground cover with year round interest.  Helps control soil erosion on slopes and hillsides.  Effective when grown around shrubs, along sunny border margins, in naturalized areas and in native plant gardens.  Herb gardens.  Drape over a wall.  Rock gardens.  

Teas have been made from certain plant parts (leaves, stems and roots) for a variety of medicinal purposes (antiseptic, astringent and diuretic).  Leaves are rich in tannins and have been used in the process of tanning hides/leather.  Sprigs of green leaves with red berries may be used as Christmas decorations.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Ardisia japonica, commonly known as Japanese ardisia or marlberry, is a low-growing, coarsely-textured, stoloniferous, woody evergreen shrub which spreads by underground runners to produce a succession of upright stems rising to 8-12” tall.  Stems are clad with thick, glossy, leathery, serrulate-margined, opposite or subwhorled, elliptic to lanceolate leaves (each to 3” long) which are densely concentrated near the branch ends.  It is native to mixed forests or bamboo woods, hillsides, and dark damp places in southeastern China, Japan and Korea.  Japanese ardisia will rapidly spread by suckers to form a dense ground cover shrub for shady areas of the landscape.  It can produce large colonies over time.  Small, five-petaled, white to pale pink flowers (each to 3/8” diameter) bloom in July-August in 3-5 flowered panicles.  Flowers are followed by showy red drupes which ripen to black in fall.  

This plant is one of the 50 Fundamental herbs in Chinese medicine.  It is used for a large number of different medical applications including treatment of bronchitis.Genus name comes from the Greek aradis meaning a point in reference to the pointed anthers of these flowering trees and shrubs.Specific epithet means from Japan in reference to native habitat.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aronia melanocarpa, commonly called black chokeberry, is an open, upright, spreading, somewhat rounded but leggy, suckering, deciduous shrub that typically grows 3-6’ tall.  It is native to low woods, swamps, bogs and moist thickets but occasionally to dry upland areas, from Newfoundland to southern Ontario and Minnesota south to Missouri, Tennessee and Georgia.  Although common in many parts of its native range, it is somewhat rare in Missouri where it is only found in sandy wet or boggy ground along spring branches at the base of Crowley Ridge in southeastern Stoddard County (Steyermark).  It is noted for its 5-6 flowered clusters of white 5-petaled spring (May) flowers, glossy elliptic to obovate dark green leaves (to 2-3” long) with finely toothed margins, black autumn berries (blueberry size) and purple/red fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek word aria  the name for a species of Sorbus of which the fruits resemble chokeberry.Specific epithet comes from the words melano meaning black and carpa meaning fruit in reference to the ripe fruits of this shrub.The common name of chokeberry is in reference to the tart and bitter taste of the fruits which are technically edible but so astringent as to cause choking in most of those who try.  Fruits are sometimes used to make tasty jams and jellies.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to leaf spots and twig/fruit blight.
","
Garden Uses

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia dracunculus, commonly called wild tarragon, is a polymorphic species that is native to temperate Europe and Asia.  It is also found in western North America, though many of these populations may have resulted from introduction and naturalization.  It produces viable seed and will often self-seed.  Its leaves produce variable flavor and aroma, sometimes lacking both flavor and aroma.  It has a long history of medicinal uses, but the species is not often used for culinary purposes.  It is a rhizomatous perennial or sub-shrub that typically grows to 24” (less frequently to 36”) tall on generally erect stems clad with narrow, linear to lance-shaped, light to medium green leaves (to 3-4” long). Greenish white flowers in narrow elongated panicles bloom in summer.  

Tarragon sold under the species name without reference to cultivar or variety may be the less pungent Russian tarragon, which is considered by most cooks to be significantly inferior for culinary use. See A. d. 'Sativa' for information on French tarragon.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is a Latin word meaning a small dragon.
","
Problems
Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly drained ones.  French tarragon does not always survive St. Louis winters, and wet soils in winter is a common cause of plant demise.

Culture
Best grown in poor to moderately fertile, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Excellent soil drainage is essential for growing this plant well. Plants perform poorly in moist to wet soils where they are susceptible to root rot. Plant stems tend to lodge in summer, especially if grown in fertile soils and/or part shade. General foliage decline commonly occurs in high humidity summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Consider pinching back stems in late spring to reduce mature plant height. If foliage declines or stems flop in summer, plants may be sheared to revitalize. Plants may spread somewhat aggressively in the garden by rhizomes and by self-seeding. Prompt removal of flower heads as they appear prevents self-seeding. Soil barriers may be considered to help contain rhizomatous spread. Propagate by division in late summer to early autumn.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia ludoviciana is native throughout North America from Canada to Mexico. In Missouri, it is typically found growing on rocky prairies, glades, bluff escarpments, open wooded slopes, waste ground, along roads and railroads primarily in the northern and western parts of the State (Steyermark). It is commonly called white sage because of the appearance of its foliage. This is an erect, rhizomatous, somewhat weedy, herbaceous perennial that grows in spreading clumps to 2-3' (less frequently to 4') tall on greenish white stems clad with aromatic, sage-like, lance-shaped leaves (to 2-4” long) that are white woolly beneath and nearly glabrous above. Foliage adds texture and contrast to gardens. Tiny, somewhat inconspicuous, yellowish-gray, discoid flower heads (rays absent) appear in dense panicles at the stem ends in summer. Flowers have little ornamental value. Flowers give way to dry achenes. Foliage is aromatic when bruised.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet is in reference to the Louisiana Territory.Popular cultivars of this species include A. ludoviciana 'Silver King' and A. ludoviciana 'Valerie Finnis'.
","
Problems
Foliage may decline and plant stems may flop in summer. Susceptible to root rot in moist soils, particularly poorly-drained ones. Watch for unwanted spread by rhizomes and/or self-seeding.
","
Garden Uses
Silver-green foliage provides excellent contrast to flowering plants and green foliage. Invasive habit discourages use of this plant in borders or herb gardens. Good selection for areas with poor dry soils. Good selection for isolated areas where it can naturalize without risk to other plants.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Artemisia vulgaris, commonly known by a large number of common names including mugwort, wild wormwood, and felon herb, is an upright rhizomatous herbaceous perennial which grows 2-4’ (less frequently to 6') tall but spreads in the landscape by rhizomes, often aggressively, to 6’ wide or more.  

It is native to and widespread in Europe and throughout northern Asia from Russia to Japan and Korea.  It can be weedy and invasive, particularly in disturbed sites.  It was introduced as an herbal plant into a number of sites in North America, starting with the first European visits in the early 1600's.  Plants have naturalized over time throughout southern Canada, the eastern and Midwestern United States (Maine to Minnesota south to Florida and Louisiana) and in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana).  It typically grows in loamy or sandy soils in forested areas, coastal strands and along roadsides.   

Plants feature (a) angular reddish-brown stems, (b) aromatic, petiolate, deeply lobed and cut basal and middle leaves which grow to as much as 4” long, each leaf being deep green above and white tomentose beneath, (c) smaller and narrower cauline upper leaves which become linear in the flower panicles, (d) yellowish to reddish brown apetalous discoid flowers (to 1/8” across) which bloom late summer to early fall in dense leafy panicles, and (e) achenes which follow the flowers.  

This species has a long history of human use in Europe and Asia as an herbal medicine.  Leaves are technically edible, but bitter and toxic when consumed in quantity.  Aroma from fresh or dried plant leaves will repel insects.Genus is named for Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon, wild animals and hunting.Specific epithet means common.Common name of felon herb comes from a prior herbal medicinal use of this plant in the treatment of felons, a painful pus-producing infection which typically occurs at the end of a finger or toe.  Mugwort common name (mug means drinking vessel) comes from an historical use of this plant in Europe to flavor beer before the introduction of hops.  Wormwood common name is in reference to the former European growth of this plant as a vermifuge (folk medicine remedy for expelling worms from the intestinal tract).

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich soils in full sun to part shade. Foliage decline can occur rapidly if soils are permitted to dry out. With consistent moisture, it performs well in full sun in the northern portions of its growing range. It prefers part shade in the southern part of its growing range. Removing faded flower stalks will not prolong bloom, but may improve plant appearance, particularly if a ground cover look is desired. On the other hand, flower stalks on female plants may be left in place to enjoy the continuing ornamental effect of the dried seed plumes. Plants can be slow to establish. Plants may struggle in the hot and humid conditions of the deep South and are not recommended for gardens south of USDA Zone 7.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aruncus dioicus, commonly called goat's beard, is a Missouri native plant which occurs in moist woodlands and along bluffs in the central and southeast part of the State. A tall, erect, bushy, clump-forming plant typically growing 4-6' high which features pinnately compound, dark green foliage and showy, plume-like spikes of tiny, cream colored flowers which rise well above the foliage in early to mid summer, creating a bold effect. This rose family member is somewhat similar in appearance to astilbe. Dioecious (separate male and female plants) as the species name suggests. Plants with male flowers (numerous stamens per flower) produce a showier bloom than plants with female flowers (three pistils per flower).Genus name is the classical Greek name for these plants.Specific epithet means having separate male and female plants.

Blood flower is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual. It is easily grown from seed each year. Start seed indoors in pots 8-10 weeks before last spring frost date. Plant seedlings outside after last frost date. Grows best in light, rich, evenly moist, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Tolerates some soil dryness. Plants are noted for being weedy in their native tropical habitats and in warm winter areas such as the deep South where they will self-seed somewhat profusely. Plants will not self-seed in the St. Louis climate. Container plants may be cut back and brought inside into bright sunny locations in winter. May also be grown as an indoor plant in bright sun with regular watering during the growing season and with reduced watering in a cool location in winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asclepias curassavica, commonly called blood flower, is a tender evergreen perennial in the dogbane and milkweed family. It is native to South America, but has naturalized worldwide in many tropical and subtropical areas. It has a much longer flowering period than the perennial milkweeds that are winter hardy in St. Louis. It typically grows as a subshrub to 2-3’ tall on upright stems clad with pointed, opposite, lanceolate leaves (to 6” long). Leaves are medium green sometimes with white midribs. Showy flowers with five sepals and five lobes appear in rounded axillary clusters (cymes) in late spring to early summer. Flowers are red-orange with yellow hoods. Flowering continues throughout the summer to early autumn. Hummingbirds, butterflies and bees are attracted to the flowers. Monarch butterflies lay eggs on this plant and the resulting larvae (caterpillars) use the plant leaves as a food source. Flowers are followed by long, narrow seed pods (3-4” long) which split open when ripe releasing silky tailed seeds for dispersal by wind. Stems and leaves exude a milky sap when cut or bruised. Plants can be poisonous to livestock. Additional common names for this plant include tropical milkweed, scarlet milkweed, swallow wort, Indian root and matal.Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means of Curacao of the Dutch Antilles in the southern Caribbean Sea.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Somewhat weedy and can spread in warm winter locations where it will self-seed. Watch for aphids. Sooty mold may develop if aphid populations are not checked. Consider wearing gloves when working with these plants because the milky sap is poisonous if ingested and can be toxic to human skin.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where plants may be grown outside in the ground in warm, bright but shady locations in humus-rich, moist but well-drained soils with added leaf mold, sand and grit.  Avoid direct sun.  Ferns grown outside prefer minimum temperatures of 50 degrees F., but will usually tolerate occasional brief temperature dips into the high 30s.  

In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant.  It performs best in a porous, well-drained, peaty potting mixture in bright filtered light.  Avoid direct sun or dense shade locations.  It does best in warm, moderately bright areas of the home, but tolerates some shade.  Grows well in bright north-facing windows.  Keep soils uniformly moist.  Fairly high humidity is needed, which is a condition that can sometimes be difficult to achieve indoors in winter.  Good plant sites include humidified areas, bathrooms or atop wet-pebbled trays.  Avoid handling the somewhat delicate fronds.  Indoor plants generally seem to have less tolerance for temperatures that dip below 50 degrees F. than plants grown in the ground outdoors.  Ideal indoor temperatures are 60-70 degrees F. with a minimum of 55 degrees F.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Asplenium nidus, commonly called bird’s nest fern, is a slow-growing, epiphytic fern of the spleenwort family featuring simple, entire, strap-shaped, glossy, bright apple green fronds with contrasting dark brown to black midribs and undulating margins.  Fronds spread upward and outward to form a vase-shaped, green rosette with a nest-like center (albeit memorialized by some as resembling a bird’s nest) into which fallen leaves and other organic matter typically accumulate.  Mature fronds on outdoor plants grow to as much as 4-5’ long with a spread to 8” wide, but fronds on indoor container plants typically grow to only 1 1/2'  to 2’ long.  Undersides often display sori (clusters of sporangia) arranged in herringbone fashion in straight black lines from the central mid-rib to the frond margin.   

Species plants are native to tropical areas from Polynesia and Hawaii west to Southeast Asia, Australia, and Madagascar.  They are often found growing on tropical rainforest trees as epiphytes which collect water and organic matter in their bowl-shaped rosettes.Genus name comes from the Greek and means ""without a spleen"", possibly in reference to the believe that certain species of this plant could treat problems of the spleen.Specific epithet means nest in obvious reference to the nest-like structure formed by the rosette of overlapping fronds.Common name of bird’s nest fern is in reference to the aforementioned nest formed by the fronds which arguably resembles a bird’s nest.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for slugs and scale.  Drafts may cause fronds to brown at the edges.  Chemical insecticides will damage plants (use soaps if necessary). Mealybugs.  Bacterial leaf diseases.  Leaf nematode is also common.

Primarily native to Europe, although there exists a rare American variety (Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum) that reportedly may be found in a very limited number of sites in Alabama, Tennessee, Michigan, New York and Ontario. The American variety is currently classified as threatened in its entire range. Plants sold in commerce are the European variety.

Formerly included in the genus Phyllitis and is synonymous with Phyllitis scolopendrium.Genus name comes from the Greek and means ""without a spleen"", possibly in reference to the believe that certain species of this plant could treat problems of the spleen.Specific epithet means millipede an allusion to the rows of sori.Common name is in reference to the supposed resemblance of the frond shape to a deer’s tongue.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Athyrium filix-femina, commonly called lady fern, is a deciduous fern that features lacy-cut, erect or ascending, 2 to 3-pinnate or pinnatifid, finely-divided, lanceolate, light green fronds which grow in a dense circular shuttlecock-like clump to 2-3' tall.  Each frond (leaf) has twenty to thirty pairs of elliptic non-opposite pinna (leaflets) with narrow pointed tips.  Each pinna is divided into deeply-cut lanceolate to oblong pinnules (subleaflets).  Sori and indusia are found on the undersides of the pinnules.  This is a circumglobal species which is found in rich moist woods, thickets, fields, meadows and ravines throughout northern North America, Europe and Asia.Genus name comes from Greek athyros meaning doorless in reference to the slowly opening hinged indusia (spore covers).Specific epithet comes from Latin filix meaning fern and femina meaning woman as confirmed by the common name of lady fern.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Fronds frequently become somewhat tattered in appearance by mid summer.

Culture
Grow in dry, average to sandy, well-drained soils in full sun. Avoid heavy clay soils. Rots may develop in moist or poorly-drained soils. Best flowering is in full sun, however plant foliage appreciates some afternoon shade in hot summer climates. Cut back plants up to 1/2 after flowering to help maintain attractive form. In hot and humid summer climates such as the St. Louis area, this plant is difficult to grow well and can be very short-lived. In the deep South, many gardeners simply grow it in the manner of an annual by planting new plants each fall, enjoying the spring bloom and then removing the plants as the foliage depreciates in summer. New plants are commonly sold in early spring by nurseries. Seed may be planted in the garden in early fall or may be started indoors in late winter from 8-10 weeks before planting outside.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Aurinia saxatilis commonly called basket-of-gold is a low-growing, spreading perennial that produces a profuse spring bloom of bright yellow flowers that are particularly attractive in rock gardens, sprawled over rocks or cascaded over rock walls. After bloom, it will remain in the garden as an attractive ground cover unless the foliage depreciates or plants die back from hot summer conditions. It is native from central Europe to Turkey. This is a mat-forming perennial with woody roots that grows to 6-12” tall and features spatulate basal leaves (to 5” long) and smaller linear-oblanceolate stem leaves. Leaves are gray-green. Bright yellow flowers in corymbose panicles bloom in spring. 

Additional common names include yellow alyssum, madwort, goldentuft and gold-dust.

Synonymous with and formerly known as Alyssum saxatile.Genus name comes from the word aureus meaning golden in allusion to the flowers of A. saxatilis (formerly Alyssum saxatile).Specific epithet means found among rocks.
","
Problems
Watch for aphids. Plants are often short-lived in the St. Louis area.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Averrhoa carambola, commonly called star fruit is a small, slow-growing, short-trunked tropical tree that probably originated in Malaysia, Indonesia and southern China. It now extinct in the wild. It is grown commercially in many tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world for its unusual fruit. It also serves as an attractive, multi-branched ornamental tree. It typically grows to 20-30' tall with a broad rounded crown featuring odd-pinnate, medium green leaves (to 6-10"" long). Each leaf has 5-11 ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaflets (to 1.5-3.5"" long). Leaflets are sensitive to light and touch, folding up like mimosas in the dark of night or if disturbed. Fragrant rose flowers (1/4"" across) bloom in the leaf axils throughout the year, typically in up to four separate flushes. Flowers give way to waxy, oblong/ellipsoidal, 5-angled, orange/yellow-skinned fruits (3-6"" long) which are star-shaped when sliced in cross-section, hence the common name. Fruit flesh is juicy and ranges from sour to mildly sweet when ripe. Fruits are typically eaten fresh, combined in salads with other fruits, added to dessert dishes or sliced for use as star-shaped garnishes.Genus name comes from the fruit trees named after a celebrated Moorish physician and philosopher Ibn-Ruschd known as Averroes (1126-1198) who was born in Cordoba, Spain.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Baccharis pilularis, commonly known as chaparral broom, coyote brush or dwarf chaparral false willow, is an evergreen shrub that typically grows in two different forms, namely, as (1) a prostrate, mat-forming, evergreen groundcover shrub to 8-24” tall spreading to 6’ wide or more, or (2) an upright-rounded shrub to 4-8’ tall and as wide.  It is native to the western U. S. where it is primarily found on sea cliffs, bluffs, sand dunes, foothills and thickets in the outer coastal ranges from Mexico and Baja California north to Oregon.  It prefers open, dry sites.  It is distinguished by its dark brown stems clad with serrate, sticky-coated, obovate to oblanceolate green leaves (each 1/2 to 3/4” long).  This shrub is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with the yellowish male flowers producing pollen and the pollinated white female flowers producing fruit (cottony seed clusters).  Flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, but are not particularly ornamental.  Sex of a plant cannot be determined until bloom time.  Typically, only male plants are cultivated for home use because they lack the cottony seed clusters which some gardeners consider to be distracting and messy additions to the landscape.Genus name in honor of Bacchus, the god of wine.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pilulifera meaning having small little fruits in reference to the cottony orbicular seed clusters found on female plants.

Baptisia sphaerocarpa, commonly called false indigo (or yellow wild indigo) is an upright, mounded perennial that typically grows 2-3’ tall. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers (to 1/2” long) in erect racemes (to 12-15”) atop yellowish-green flower stems extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, blue-green leaves (leaflets to 2” long). Blooms in spring. Flowers give way to inflated spherical seed pods (to 3/4” diameter) that turn tan to brown when ripe and have considerable ornamental interest. Stems with seed pods are valued additions to dried flower arrangements. Steyermark reports that this species is unique among the species of Baptisia found in Missouri by having leaves on the smaller branches with only 1-2 leaflets. The current range of this species appears to be Louisiana to Texas north to Missouri and Oklahoma, however it is not clear that it is indigenous to all of these areas. This plant was apparently introduced a number of years ago into certain prairie areas and along certain railroad tracks in five Missouri counties, and accordingly is not considered to be a native Missouri taxon (Steyermark).Genus name comes from the Greek word bapto meaning ""to dye"".Specific epithet means with rounded fruit.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11 where this small shrub (or subshrub) is typically found growing along roadsides, slopes, and streambanks, but also in some xeric sites.  Best growth typically occurs in dry to medium moisture well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Although drought tolerant, shrubs prefer moderate but even soil moisture.  Best flowering occurs with regular applications of fertilizer.  Propagate by seed or stem/tip cuttings.  Shrubs self sow in the landscape.  Prune to desired shape.  Cut back stems in spring (sometimes to the ground) to promote a bushy rounded growth.  Shrubs may survive winter in Zone 8, but to facilitate this climate, stems should be cut back to the ground when winter frosts kill the tops, with application of mulch to the root zone for winter (mound of sand covered with a layer of pine straw).  Mulch must be removed in late winter to early spring in anticipation of new growth for the year.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Barleria cristata, commonly known as Philippine violet, is a dense, upright, hairy-stemmed, subtropical, evergreen subshrub in the acanthus family that typically matures to 3-4’ tall with a spread to 2-3’ wide.  It is native from northern India and Myanmar (Burma) to southern China and Southeast Asia.  Potential growing areas in the U.S. for this shrub include Florida, southern Louisiana and Texas, southern Arizona and California.  Elliptic to narrow-ovate to oblong leaves (to 4” long and 2” wide) are dark green above and pale green beneath.  Funnel-shaped, 2-inch long flowers (pink, purple, white or mauve with white stripes) bloom in axillary spikes on new growth over a long flowering season from September to December plus mid-spring (May).  Flowers are followed by seedpods.Genus name honors Jacques Barrelier (1606-1673) French botanist and monk.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word cristatus meaning crested or with tassel-like tips.Common name of Philippine violet is a bit of an enigma because, although its flowers are arguably of violet color, the shrub has no relationship to the Philippine Islands or violets.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9b-11.  Best in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  Best with moderate but consistent moisture.  Grows well in a variety of soils as long as well-drained.  Thrives in heat but leaves may brown along the edges in dry heat or droughty conditions.  Established trees have respectable drought tolerance, however. Best sited in locations protected from cold winds and frost.  Foliage will suffer damage when temperatures dip below freezing and tree will usually not survive winter temperatures that dip below 26 degrees F.  This is a sterile hybrid (flat seed pods seen on other species are absent) that must be propagated by vegetative cuttings, air layering or grafting onto seedlings of one of the parent species.  All trees in existence are descendants of the hybrids first cultivated at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens, all of which were propagated from the single accidental hybrid first discovered in 1880.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bauhinia x blakeana, commonly known as Hong Kong Orchid Tree, is a small often multi-trunked evergreen to semi-evergreen flowering tree with an umbrella-like shape featuring an irregular rounded crown.  It typically grows to 20’ tall, but occasionally in optimum conditions to as much as 40’ tall.  This hybrid has no native territory as such because it is only known today from trees propagated from a single accidental hybrid discovered in the wild and collected in 1880 near the ruins of a house along the shore of Hong Kong Island near Pok Fu Lam.  Cuttings were taken by a nearby French mission, with subsequent cuttings taken from the mission trees for inclusion at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens.  This hybrid is not only considered to have the best ornamental flowers in the genus but is also considered to be one of the most attractive flowering trees in the world.  Its parents are believed to be B. purpurea x B. variegata.  This hybrid was first botanically described in 1908.  It was chosen as the floral emblem of Hong Kong in 1965.  Its flower image in white became the center of the red Hong Kong flag in 1997.  In the U.S., this tree is frequently cultivated in Hawaii.  It grows well in warm parts of California, Arizona, southern Florida and Texas.  

Fragrant rich rose purple to rose crimson 5-6” wide orchid-like flowers with paler veins bloom over a long late fall to spring (November to April) period.  Each flower has a 5-petaled corolla with the uppermost petal being darker toward the base.  Flowers are shaped like some orchids (to 6” wide).  Flowers of this hybrid are larger than the flowers on species plants.  Bi-lobed, light to medium green leaves have yellowish green veins (6-8”).  Leaves are deeply cleft at the apex and base, producing a twin leaf (butterfly wing) effect.  Trees are partially deciduous (some leaf drop begins to occur in fall around the time flowering begins, but some leaves will persist to varying degrees throughout winter).Genus name honors 16th Century Swiss botanists and herbalists Johann Bauhin and Gaspard Bauhin (i.e., named after identical twins in reference to the bi-lobed leaves unique to genus plants).Hybrid name honors Sir Henry Blake, plant enthusiast and governor of Hong Kong from 1898 to 1903, and his wife Lady Edith Blake.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Beaucarnea recurvata, commonly called ponytail palm, is an evergreen caudiciform shrub or tree that is native to semi-desert areas of southeastern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala where it typically grows to as much as 30' tall. Where not winter hardy, it is commonly grown as a houseplant that over time will eventually rise to as much as 6-8' tall. Notwithstanding its common name, ponytail palm is not a true palm. It is noted for having a large, swollen, often flask-shaped, water-retaining base (caudex) from which rises a trunk-like stem bearing narrow, flat, palm-like, spreading to recurved leaves (to 6' long but only 1"" wide) that droop fountain-like in clusters from the branch ends. Trunks are usually single with young plants, but several smaller trunks as well as some sparse branching near the top may develop with age. Old plants may produce tiny creamy white flowers in clusters. Flowers rarely appear on houseplants.Genus name is of uncertain origin.Specific epithet means curved backwards.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, fertile, consistently moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants prefer part shade in southern areas with hot summers. Plants are intolerant of drought. Although English daisy is a perennial, it is typically grown for ornamental purposes as a biennial in the South or as an annual in the North, with plants being dug up and thrown away after bloom. It is usually grown from seed. In the South (including St. Louis), seed is planted in fall or indoors in winter for bloom the following spring. By the heat of the summer, plants decline to the point where removal becomes appropriate. In the North, seed is planted in early spring for bloom in summer. In cool summer conditions (USDA Zones 4-5 and the West Coast), plants may spread aggressively by spreading crowns and self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Bellis perennis, commonly called English daisy, has a varied reputation (depending in large part on geographical location) ranging from attractive low-spreading ornamental flower to common (sometimes detested) weed of lawns, fields and abandoned areas. Each plant features a sprawling, flattened rosette of small, spatula-shaped, dark green leaves to 1-2” tall. Daisies (to 2” diameter) with white rays and yellow centers bloom on pubescent stems rising to 3-6” tall. Young leaves may be eaten raw in salads or cooked. In the St. Louis area, plants are not considered to be lawn weeds, with best bloom occurring in spring when the mornings are cool. Plants typically burn out with summer heat. Native to Europe, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the northern U. S. and West Coast.Genus name comes from the Latin word bellus meaning pretty.Specific epithet means lasting through the year.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. In cool summer areas, plants can spread and difficult to eradicate once established.
","
Garden Uses
In cool summer locations, English daisy has a number of different uses including beds, border fronts, rock gardens and wild flower areas where it may be naturalized without concern of spread. Also effective as a ground cover, edger or companion to spring bulbs. Excellent in containers.

Culture
Best grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, light to sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade.  For many of the plants in this species, seeds (dried ""seed clusters"", each with 3 or 4 seeds) are typically sown in the ground about 30 days prior to the last spring frost date in Zones 3-7 for harvest in summer and fall or in the alternative, are sown in summer in Zones 8-10 for harvest over winter.  Several seedlings will emerge from each seed cluster.  Seedlings should be thinned to a spread appropriate for the specific type of plant being grown.  Successive plantings may be made at monthly intervals during the growing season (seed planted in the heat of summer may not germinate however).  For proper growth, species plants generally need regular and consistent moisture, with additional water provided during hot and dry summer periods.  

For specific growing instructions on growing plants within each Cultivar Group of this species, consult the specific recommendations applicable to the Group of the plant being grown.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Beta vulgaris, commonly known as beet, is an herbaceous biennial (infrequently perennial) which is typically grown today as an annual.  The ancestor plant for this species is the wild sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritime) which was probably native to coastal parts of the Mediterranean, but which eventually spread over time to the Atlantic Coast of Europe, the Near East and India.  Sea beet can still be found as a wild plant along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts.  In general, beets of this species have been valued since ancient times for their edible leaves and midribs.  Ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated beets as potherbs.  Cultivation of beet roots as food first gained momentum in the 16th century.   From the 16th century onward, Europeans began to consume the roots primarily as a vegetable. During the 1800’s, intense artificial selection in Europe produced diverse beet cultivars used today for a variety of different purposes.  
 
Beet cultivars today are classified into four different Groups (a Group being an assemblage of named cultivars with similar characteristics).  Groups grown for their thickened tuberous roots (beets) are: 

1.	Beta vulgaris (Garden Beet or Beetroot Group) is the red root vegetable sold in grocery stores around the world as garden beets.  This Group is best associated with the word “beet”. 

2.	Beta vulgaris (Sugar Beet Group) is the plant which is commercially grown for sugar production (roots contain high concentrations of sucrose).  Roots were first found to contain sugar in 1747.  This beet was developed in Germany in the late 18th century.  About 20-25% of the sugar produced in the world today comes from sugar beets.

3.	Beta vulgaris (Fodderbeet Group or Mangelwurzel) is grown for its tubers which are harvested for use as livestock fodder.  It was developed in the 18th century. 

Group grown for their leaves rather than tuberous roots:  

4.	Beta vulgaris (Leaf Beet Group) is a leaf vegetable (e.g. chard or spinach beet) which is grown for harvest of its edible leaves and midribs.  Leaf beets have been cultivated from ancient times to present.  Group plants lack swollen tubers/roots.  Spinach beet is similar in taste to spinach (Spinacia).  
 
In general, genus plants typically grow to 2-3’ tall (to 4-6’ tall when in flower in the second year).  Ovate to wedge-shaped, long-petioled, basal leaves (to 6” long) appear in rosettes with smaller, alternate, second-year stem leaves.  Deep purple-red (but sometimes golden yellow or red/white striped) roots are usually swollen, except in the case of the leafy vegetable plants found in the Leaf Beet Group.  Flowers (usually greenish and non-showy, but sometimes with red or purple tinges) bloom in dense spikes only in the second year, which means the flowers are typically not seen when plants are grown and harvested for their beets and/or leaves as one-year annuals.Genus name comes from the Latin name for beet.Specific epithet comes from Latin meaning common.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Beets may suffer from fungal leaf spots, downy mildew, powdery mildew and root rots. Watch for leaf miners, flea beetles, leafhoppers, aphids and caterpillars.
","
Garden Uses
Edible garden vegetable for harvest of underground beets and/or leaves and/or foliage ornamental (Leaf Beet and Garden Beet Groups).  Commercial source of sucrose for production of sugar (Sugar Beet Group). Fodder for livestock (Fodder Group cultivars).

Culture
Easily grown average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. River birch is perhaps the most culturally adaptable and heat tolerant of the birches. Prefers moist, acidic, fertile soils including semi-aquatic conditions, but also tolerates drier soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. Adapts well to heavy clay soils of Missouri and will tolerate poor drainage. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula nigra, commonly called river birch, is a vigorous, fast-growing, medium-sized, Missouri native deciduous tree which occurs on floodplains, swampy bottomlands and along streams throughout the State. In cultivation, it can be trained as either a single trunk or multi-trunked tree. As a single trunk tree, it develops a pyramidal habit when young, but matures to a more rounded shape typically growing 40-70' tall. Multi-trunked trees form a more irregular crown and are generally considered to be the superior growth habit for this species. Salmon-pink to reddish brown bark exfoliates to reveal lighter inner bark. Leathery, diamond-shaped, medium to dark green leaves (1.5-3.5"" long) with doubly toothed margins turn yellow in fall. Monoecious flowers appear in drooping, brownish male catkins and smaller, upright, greenish female catkins.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means black.
","
Problems
One of the most disease-free birches. Most species of birch grow best in cool, northern climates, but do not adapt well to the hot summers of USDA Zones 5-9 and can be short-lived therein. Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which typically infects and kills birches stressed by summer heat and humidity. River birches are Missouri natives that are naturally adapted to the climate and are extremely resistant to birch borer. Although river birches have some susceptibility to aphids, leaf miner and iron chlorosis in high pH soils, these problems are somewhat minor in comparison to the birch borer.'Heritage' is a very popular river birch cultivar with superior ornamental features to the species (see Betula nigra 'Curly' HERITAGE).
","
Garden Uses
Specimen or small groupings for lawns, parks and commercial properties, and, in particular, for wet soils along ponds, streams or in low spots. Good choice for the St. Louis area and generally a good substitute for the paper birch in the hot and humid areas of USDA Zones 5-9.

In St. Louis, paper birch is best grown in medium to wet, well-drained sandy or rocky loams in part shade. It is best sited in a northern or eastern exposure that receives some afternoon shade. It needs consistently moist soils. Consider using soaker hoses and bark mulches to keep the root zones cool and moist. It needs little pruning, but if necessary, prune during the dormant season. Avoid pruning in spring when the sap is running. Performs best in cool northern climates where summer temperatures rarely exceed 75 degrees F. and where root zones are generally covered with snow throughout the winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula papyrifera, commonly called paper birch or canoe birch, is primarily native to the cold climates of Canada and Alaska (USDA Zones 1-3), with its range dipping down into a few of the northern U.S. states (USDA Zones 4-5A) and further south in the mountains (to Colorado in the Rockies and to North Carolina in the Appalachians). This tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips to reveal an orange-brown inner bark. Mature trees develop black markings on the white bark. Single trunk trees grow to 50-70’ tall with an oval rounded crown. Multi-trunked trees grow shorter with a more irregular crown. Ovate, irregularly toothed, dark green leaves (to 4” long). Quality clear yellow fall color. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in drooping catkins (to 4” long) and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1 1/4” long). Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer. The use of the bark for making birch bark canoes is well known.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means paper-bearing.
","
Problems
This species of birch grows poorly and is generally short-lived in the St. Louis climate. It thrives in cool northern summers, but does poorly in the heat and humidity of St. Louis summers. Weakened birches become vulnerable to the bronze birch borer which, in the St. Louis area, typically infects and kills trees that are stressed by summer heat and humidity. Although paper birches have some susceptibility to aphids, leaf miner, birch skeletonizer and dieback, these problems are somewhat minor in comparison to the borer.
","
Garden Uses
In cool northern climates, paper birch is an excellent landscape tree that mixes well with evergreens and produces good fall color. It is not recommended for the St. Louis climate. River birch (see Betula nigra) is a better selection for St. Louis.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Betula pendula, commonly called European white birch or white birch, is native to Europe and Asia Minor where it typically occurs in wood margins, heaths, hills and slopes. It has been widely planted in Canada and the northern U.S. as an ornamental. As is the case with paper birch (B. papyrifera), this tree is noted for its white bark, which exfoliates in papery strips. It is also noted for its drooping or pendulous branches, hence the specific epithet. Mature trees become furrowed and blackish-gray near the bottom of the trunk. It is a small to medium sized tree that typically grows to 30-40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with a pyramidal to oval rounded crown. Ovate, glabrous, toothed, glossy green leaves (to 2.5” long) have long tapered tips. Greenish-yellow fall color is usually undistinguished. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in drooping catkins (to 2.5” long) and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1 1/4” long).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Blechnum spicant, called deer fern or hard fern, is a northern species with a somewhat circumpolar distribution but most ferns in the genus Blechnum are found in tropical areas. It is native to northwestern North American from Alaska to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, a small corner of northern Idaho and California. It primarily occurs in moist to wet coniferous forests, wet slide areas, stream banks or bogs in up to sub-alpine terrain. It is also native to Europe and northeast Asia. This fern is particularly distinctive because of its two different types of fronds. Evergreen sterile fronds (to 8-24” long) are stiff, leathery, pinnatifid and dark green, forming a loose outward-spreading, flattened rosette. As the season progresses, sterile fronds may lie horizontally on the ground. Fertile fronds (16-24” long) are located in an erect vertical fountain in the center of the sterile frond rosette. They are similar to the sterile ones but taller, with much thinner and widely separated leaflets. Fertile fronds turn brown and wither by the end of the summer, leaving the evergreen sterile rosette.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name blechnon for a fern (probably not this one though).

Culture
Grows best in full sun or light shade in well-drained, acid soils. Bougainvillea can tolerate hot, dry locations fairly well and flowers bountifully in full sun with regular watering. Chlorosis can be a problem in alkaline soil. Regular pruning may be necessary to shape the plant or direct its growth, it tolerates trimming well. Be careful when pruning to avoid injury from the 1 to 2 inch long thorns. In St. Louis, to bring bougainvillea into flower, a dormant period at a low temperature is essential in winter. The plant will drop most of its leaves and you should stop fertilizing. From March on, it must be given a well-lit, warm position. Late in May, it is best placed outdoors. If pruning is required this should be done immediately after flowering. Pinching the tips of new growth will encourage branching. Water freely in summer and sparingly in the winter. Fertilize every two weeks during the growing season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
The 14 species of this South American genus in the four-o-clock family, seen in warm-temperate to tropical regions as spectacular climbers, are really scrambling shrubs and usually remain fairly compact or behave as ground covers if left free standing. Leaves are thin, sometimes downy, and broadly elliptical with pointed tips; stems are protected by long narrow thorns, found at the leaf axils. Foliage is evergreen or deciduous, depending on the species and climate. True flowers, in groups of 1 to 3 are tubular, creamy white to yellow and around 1 inch wide, largely hidden by brightly colored petal-like bracts. In the St. Louis area, these plants are a shrubby vine that can be grown in greenhouses, sun porches or in containers or baskets outdoors in the summer months.Genus name honors Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1729-1811), sailor and explorer, who sailed round the world 1767-1769.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helichrysum heldreichii, commonly known as strawflower or everlasting, is a tender perennial or subshrub that typically grows in a mound to 2-3’ tall and as wide on woody-based stems clad with alternate, simple, linear leaves (to 3” long) covered with silvery-white downy hairs.  It is native to chalky-limestone cliffs in Crete where it is currently classified as “Vulnerable” as per the 1995 Red Data Book of Rare and Threatened Plants of Greece.  Inflorescence is a compound terminal corymb (flowers in clusters) of numerous, small, yellow-orange disk florets (rays absent) subtended by pale yellow involucre bracts.  Flowers bloom in May.  Flowers are popular additions to dried arrangements because the yellow florets and bracts retain their yellow color after being cut and dried, hence the common name of everlasting.  Fruits are seed-like achenes.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning the sun and chrysos meaning golden.Specific epithet honors Theodor H.H. von Heldreich (1822-1902), German botanist who settled in Greece where he reportedly discovered 7 new genera and over 700 new species of plants.

Culture
Easily grown as an annual in fertile, organically rich, consistently moist but well-drained soils in full sun.   Tolerates light shade.  For culinary purposes, certain plants in this genus may be grown in home gardens by seed as annuals for harvest of mustard greens.  Sow seeds directly in the ground in early spring 3/4” to 1” apart with 2’ between rows.  Thin to 4-6” apart.  Floating row covers are useful.  Best to water plants early in the day so that they will dry off before nightfall, thus reducing the likelihood of attracting fungal diseases.   Crop should be ready to harvest 40-50 days after planting.  Smaller and younger leaves are usually milder than larger and more mature leaves.  Leaves are stronger-flavored as plants begin to bolt.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brassica juncea, commonly known as Chinese mustard, brown mustard, Indian mustard, or leaf mustard, is an annual herb that is native to southern and eastern Asia.  It has been cultivated for food in Europe and Asia for hundreds of years.  It has given rise to a diverse range of leaf vegetables, little known in Europe, but popular in eastern Asia, including various Chinese mustard greens and Japanese mizuna.  

This plant has been much cultivated in some areas for harvest of spring mustard greens which may be added raw to salads.  Older leaves are often boiled before eating.  Garden plants typically grow to 1-2’ tall, featuring short, petiolate, elliptic to obovate basal leaves (to 1’ long) with 2-3 lobes per side and upper stem leaves which are much smaller and entire.  Leaf edges are toothed, scalloped or frilled.  Masses of bright, yellow, 4-petaled flowers mature to 1.5” long, but are not ornamentally attractive.  

Although extensively grown as a vegetable for its leaves, this plant is also often grown in some areas for its pungent seeds which are used to flavor many dishes and for its seed oil which is used in Asia for cooking.  Pods containing smooth brown seeds mature in summer.  Seed is the source of brown mustard.   

This plant has also developed a reputation outside the culinary area as a somewhat invasive weed (it is currently included on invasive species lists in Michigan, Florida and Alaska).Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means rush-like.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Flea beetles, caterpillars, aphids, snails and slugs are the most frequent pests.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, consistently moist, well-drained loams in full sun.  Kale is a cool weather vegetable that is best grown in the cool temperatures of fall.  Leaves typically acquire their best flavor after the first fall frost.  It may also be grown in early spring.  If grown in summer, however, plants will need some afternoon shade, perhaps to simply survive.  Plants perform poorly when daytime temperatures begin to consistently exceed 80 degrees F.  For spring plantings, sow seed indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  In the alternative, transplants may be purchased from local nurseries.  In either case, the seedlings/transplants should be planted in the garden about 1-2 weeks prior to last spring frost date.  For fall plantings, sow seed indoors in early July and plant the seedlings in the garden in mid-August.  Plants tolerate light frosts.  Depending on temperatures, plants may survive to Thanksgiving or into December in some years.  In mild winter climates, plants often survive winter and continue to produce leaves until they bolt in spring.  Apply mulch around plants to protect the shallow roots, reduce weeds and retain soil moisture.  Rotate crops to avoid soil borne diseases.  Plants may also be grown in containers.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Brassica oleracea (Acephala Group), commonly called kale, is a cool weather vegetable that is grown for harvest of its edible leaves.  Although very similar to cabbage, kale is distinguished by having loose, upright, wavy-edged leaves that do not form a head (acephala from Greek means headless).  Cabbage forms heads.  Leaves are typically light green to blue green, but ornamental kales (grown primarily for ornamental foliage) come in leaf colors ranging from purple to red to pink to white.  Acephala Group also includes genetically similar spring greens and collard greens.  Kale is a biennial that is grown in St. Louis as an annual.  Plants will grow to 18"" tall.  Leaves may be harvested when they reach the approximate size of a human hand.  Kale belongs to the Brassica family which includes other cool season vegetables such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower and kohlrabi.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for cabbage.Specific epithet means of the vegetable garden.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where it is easily grown in evenly moist but well-drained loams (e.g., sand-clay mixture) in full sun to part shade.  Plants will grow well in a variety of part shade situations, including open sun-dappled conditions or light shade with several hours of morning sun or early afternoon sun.  When grown in full sun, plant foliage is more likely to bronze in winter.  Limited cold tolerance.  Established plants have some drought tolerance.  Should be grown in a protected location sheltered from strong winds in the northern parts of Zone 7 where it is marginally winter hardy.  Winter winds can remove moisture from leaves at a rapid rate, often resulting in dehydration and bronzing.  True species may be winter hardy to Zone 8, but B. harlandii of gardens (form of B. microphylla - see below) may have slightly better winter hardiness.  

Plants prefer soils with a pH of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.  Plants are generally tolerant of pruning and shearing.  Pruning should never be done prior to the last spring frost date.  Pruning too early in spring often promotes tender new growth that may be damaged or killed by a late spring frost.  Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow roots.  Roots appreciate a good organic (e.g., bark or compost) mulch (1-2” thick).  Thin plants and remove dead/damaged branches annually to improve air circulation.  Carefully remove heavy snow accumulations as quickly as practicable to minimize stem/branch damage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Buxus harlandii, commonly known as Harland boxwood, is a small, bushy, multi-stemmed broadleaf evergreen shrub with a rounded vase-shaped form.  It typically grows to 2-3’ (infrequently to 5’) tall and as wide.  It is native to southern China where it is often found growing in open wooded areas and stream margins.  Bright green leaves are oblanceolate to obovate-oblong (to 1.25” long).  Each leaf has an indentation at the leaf tip.  Fragrant pale yellow flowers bloom in April–May.  Staminate flowers are stalked but pistilate ones are sessile. Attractive white trunk accents.

Many plants sold in North America under this species name are in reality forms of Buxus microphylla.Genus name comes from the Latin name for plants in this genus.Common name of boxwood is in reference to the prior use of the wood of some plants in he genus to make boxes.  Another theory on common name is that the name is in reference to young plant stems which are quadrangular (square box cross section).
","
Problems
Harland boxwood requires little special care other than annual pruning.  No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to blights and leaf spot.  Root rot can also be a problem in poorly-drained soils.  The three main insect pests of boxwoods are boxwood leafminer, boxwood mite and boxwood psyllid.  In the deep South, nematodes are of concern.  New growth is particularly susceptible to winter damage.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Caesalpinia gilliesii, commonly called bird-of-paradise, is an evergreen (semi-deciduous to deciduous in the northern parts of its growing range) shrub or small tree in the pea family that typically grows to 10’ tall but occasionally rises to as much as 15’.  It is native to subtropical areas of Argentina and Uruguay, but is now widely grown in tropical and warm temperate regions around the world for its attractive yellow flowers with bright red stamens which bloom in summer in upright open racemes on branches clad with fern-like bipinnate compound green leaves.  It was introduced into the southwestern U.S. a number of years ago where it has now escaped gardens and naturalized from California and Nevada to Oklahoma and Texas plus Georgia.   It is unrelated to Strelitzia reginae of South Africa which is a smaller clump-forming perennial that is also commonly known as bird-of-paradise.  

Each leaf (4-8” long) has 8-12 pairs of pinnae with each pinna having 7-11 pairs of elliptic leaflets (each to 1/2” long). Bruised foliage often has an unpleasant smell.  Five-petaled, pale yellow flowers (to 4-5” long), each featuring 10 showy red stamens, bloom in open terminal racemes in summer (July-August).  Flower is about 1” long, but the stamens protrude from the flower tube for another 3-4”.  Fruits are curved, flattened, linear to sickle-shaped, 8-10 seeded pods (each to 2-5” long) which split open at maturity to explosively expel seeds in all directions, thus facilitating naturalization in the landscape.Genus name honors Andrea Cesalpini (1524/25-1603), Italian botanist, philosopher, and physician to Pope Clement VIII.Specific epithet honors John Gillies (1792-1834), Scottish naval surgeon, who collected plants in Chile and Argentina.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Caesalpinia pulcherrima, commonly called peacock flower or Barbados Pride, is a fast-growing upright shrub or small tree which typically matures to 10' tall (in shrub form) or to as much as 20' tall (in tree form).  It is native to tropical America (probably the West Indies), but is now widely grown in tropical areas around the world for its long bloom of colorful flowers in upright racemes on prickly branches clad with twice pinnate green leaves.  Bowl-shaped 5-petaled flowers (to 2"" wide) bloom spring to fall (year-round in tropical climates) in 4-8"" long terminal racemes (to 40 flowers per raceme) located at the branch ends.  Flowers feature bright orange-yellow petals with contrasting elongated dark red stamens.  Another common name for this shrub is dwarf poinciana in recognition of the similarity (although of smaller size) of the flowers of this shrub to the flowers of royal poinciana (Delonix regia).  Feathery, twice pinnate green leaves are usually evergreen, but sometimes deciduous in areas near the edge of its growing range.  Each leaf has 5-8 pairs of pinnae and 6-10 pairs of leaflets per pinna.  Flowers are followed by oblong, flat fruits (seed pods to 2.5-4"" long), with each pod containing 8-10 dark brown to black seeds which are ejected as the pod splits open at maturity.  This shrub has sharp prickles along its stems, leading to the sometimes used common name of Barbados flower fence because of its use in the West Indies as a flowering barrier fence.  Green seed pods are cooked and eaten in Mexico.Genus name honors Andrea Cesalpini (1524/25-1603), Italian botanist, philosopher, and physician to Pope Clement VIII.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word pulcher meaning beauty.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calliandra haematocephala, commonly called red powder puff, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Bolivia. It was formerly included in the legume or pea family, but has recently been shifted into the mimosa family. It typically grows 10-15’ tall in its native habitat and is a very popular flowering shrub in central and southern Florida where it will survive year-round in the ground. Bipinnately compound leaves (5-10 pairs of leaflets per pinna) open copper-pink but mature to dark green. Raspberry-like flower buds open to hemispherical red powder puff flower heads (to 3” across) consisting of masses of scarlet stamens. Blooms primarily in fall and winter, but sporadic additional bloom may occur throughout the rest of the year. Variations in flower color exist, with some pink and white forms being available.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalli- meaning beautiful and aner or andros meaning male, hence a stamen in reference to the flower's many stamens.Specific epithet means blood-red head in reference to the flowers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Callirhoe involucrata, commonly called purple poppy mallow, is a mat-forming, Missouri native perennial which most frequently occurs in dryish, rocky soils in prairies, fields and along roadsides scattered in several counties mostly northeast of the Missouri River. Plants typically form a low foliage mound from 6-9"" tall on procumbent stems which spread along the ground to 3' wide. Solitary, upward facing, cup-shaped, five-petaled, poppy-like, magenta flowers (to 2.5"" wide) continuously appear on thin stems above the foliage from mid-spring to fall. Stamens form a prominent central column typical of mallow family members, but with distinctive style branches. Leaves are palmately divided into 5-7 finger-like lobes. The closely-related Missouri native fringed poppy mallow (Callirhoe digitata) is, by contrast, a spindly, erect plant which typically grows 2-3' tall.Genus name honors the daughter of a minor Greek deity, Achelous, a river god.Specific epithet means with an involucre, a ring of bracts surrounding several flowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Callistemon citrinus, commonly called scarlet bottlebrush, lemon bottlebrush or red bottlebrush, is native to Australia. It is a large evergreen upright tropical shrub that will grow to 10-15’ tall in its native habitat. It is commonly grown as a specimen or hedge in frost free areas such as southern Florida and parts of southern California. It can also be trained as a tree to 25’ tall. In containers in northern climates, it more commonly is grown as a 3-5’ tall shrub or trained as a small standard. Flowers feature numerous bushy bright red stamens in rounded to cylindrical spikes (to 4” long) that resemble bottlebrushes. Flowers bloom intermittently throughout the year in frost free areas, but more typically in summer in St. Louis. Flowers are attractive to bees. Lance-shaped to narrow-elliptic leaves (to 3” long) emerge coppery before maturing to medium green. Leaves have a lemony scent when bruised, hence the species name.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalli- meaning beautiful and stemon  meaning a stamen for the beauty of the flower.Specific epithet means resembling citron.

Culture
Grow in moist, acidic, humusy, somewhat lean, sandy or gravelly, very well-drained soils of average fertility in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in full sun (better flowering), but may appreciate some part afternoon light shade in hot summer climates. Scotch heather prefers a moist and cool climate. It generally dislikes the high heat/humidity of the Midwest and deep South and is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 6. It also dislikes the heavy clay soils commonly found in the St. Louis area. Plants need regular and consistent moisture and should not be allowed to dry out. Do not site plants in locations exposed to strong winds. Mulch with peat moss. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow root systems. Prune in spring before new growth appears. Older shrubs often become leggy and unkempt, and appreciate an annual spring pruning.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calluna vulgaris, commonly called Scotch heather, heather or ling, is a small, variably-sized, evergreen shrub that is native primarily to moors, dunes, bogs, heaths and hillsides from northern and western Europe to Siberia, Turkey and Morocco. It has naturalized in parts of North America, particularly in the northeastern U.S. and the Northwest. In optimum growing conditions, it will typically form thick mats of foliage. Tiny, four-ranked, scale-like leaves in overlapping pairs appear on slender stems rising on average to 24” tall. However cultivars appear in a wider range of sizes including prostrate forms with small tufts to only 4” tall. Leaves are typically gray to green in spring and summer but acquire bronze to purple tones in fall and winter. Rose pink to purplish pink flowers in terminal, one-sided, spike-like racemes appear in mid to late summer. The Royal Horticultural Society currently lists over 800 cultivars of this species.Genus name comes from the Greek word kalluno meaning to cleanse or adorn. Plants were used for making brooms.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
Watch for spider mites and oystershell scale. Stem and root rot may occur, particularly during warm and humid summer weather.
","
Garden Uses
Smaller varieties are useful as ground covers or in the rock garden. More erect shrubs are effective when planted in mass on hillsides. Also may be sited in borders and as background plants. Scotch heather generally combines well with dwarf conifers and deciduous shrubs.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Calocedrus decurrens, commonly called incense cedar, is an aromatic evergreen conifer with upright branching that is narrow-columnar in youth but may broaden with age to conical sometimes with a rounded crown. It is native to the Cascades, Sierras and coastal ranges, usually scattered in mixed conifer forest on western slopes, from Oregon to California, southwestern Nevada and northern Baja California. In the wild, it may grow to 100-150’ and live to 1000+ years. In cultivation, it typically grows shorter to 30-50’ tall. Flattened branchlets in fern-like sprays are covered with overlapping, lustrous, rich green, scale-like foliage in whorls of four. Foliage has an incense-like aroma when crushed. Reddish-brown, deeply-furrowed, scaly bark appears on mature trees. Solitary fruiting cones (to 1” long) ripen in summer at the branchlet ends. Although small, cones are very distinctive and are commonly described as resembling duckbills when they open to release their seed. Synonymous with and formerly known as Libocedrus decurrens.Genus name comes from the Greek words kalos meaning beautiful and cedrus meaning cedar tree.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Caltha palustris, commonly called marsh marigold, is a rhizomatous perennial that in North America is native to marshes, swamps, wet meadows and stream margins from Newfoundland to Alaska south to Nebraska, Tennessee and North Carolina. Unfortunately, the name marsh marigold is only descriptively accurate as to this plant’s habitat, because it neither looks like nor is related to marigolds (Aster family). It belongs to the buttercup family, and its shiny yellow flowers indeed look very much like buttercups. It typically grows 12-18” tall on hollow, branching stems. Bright yellow flowers (1-2” diameter) with 5-9 waxy deep yellow petal-like sepals bloom in spring (April to June). Flowers give way to seed pods which split open when ripe to disperse the seeds within. Long-stalked, rounded to cordate, glossy green basal leaves (to 7” across) attain mature size in summer well after flowering. Upper stem leaves are smaller and stalkless. Flower buds may be cooked and pickled in vinegar for use as a substitute for capers. Young leaves are also edible as cooked greens when boiled. No part of this plant should ever be eaten raw however.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a plant with a yellow flower, probably Calendula.Specific epithet means marsh-loving.

Flowers give way to brownish, urn-shaped fruits (seed capsules) which mature in fall and persist throughout the winter. Lustrous, dark green (pale beneath), ovate to elliptic leaves to 6"" long turn golden yellow in fall. Leaves are aromatic when bruised. Best to purchase this plant when in flower because the quality and intensity of the fragrance can vary widely from plant to plant. Also commonly called sweetshrub and strawberry bush in reference to the fragrant blooms which have been described as combining hints of pineapple, strawberry and banana. Further common name of hairy allspice is in reference to the hairy twigs and leaf undersides of this plant.

Culture
Camellia japonica and most of its cultivars are considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9.  Even where winter hardy, unusually cold temperatures in winter (below 10 degrees F), particularly when occurring as a sudden temperature change, can damage or sometimes kill these plants.  Japanese camellias may not be grown outdoors year round in the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6) except for a very limited number of recently developed cultivars which have displayed exceptional hardiness. 

Where winter hardy, Camellia japonica should be grown in moist, acidic (5.5 to 6.5 pH), loose, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade.  Consistent and even moisture is important.  Avoid wet soils.  Plants require protection from direct afternoon sun and wind.  Best location may be sun-dappled part shade.  Best with a root mulch.  Near the northern parts of their growing range, plants should be sited in sheltered and protected microclimates such as near the south side of a home or building.  Burlap wraps are sometimes helpful.  Plants generally dislike changes in temperature, irregular watering or being moved.  Even a change in humidity can cause plants to drop buds.  Fertilize monthly in spring and summer.  If desired, remove all but one bud from each cluster to increase the size of the flower.  Prune immediately after flowering.  

Container plants are an option for the St. Louis area and other places where plants are not winter hardy, but containers are typically not an effective option because camellias generally overwinter poorly in private residences where growing conditions and room temperatures cannot be controlled.   For container plants to thrive indoors, they must be overwintered in a temperature-controlled environment such as a greenhouse where maximum winter temperatures range from 45 to 55 degrees F.  Flower buds typically fall off where winter temperatures exceed 55 degrees F.  

A limited number of cultivars of this species are now temperature rated to USDA Zone 6, and may be grown outdoors all year in the St. Louis area in protected locations around homes, foundations and patios.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camellia japonica, commonly called Japanese camellia, is an evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-12’ tall on stems clad with oval, leathery, glossy, dark green leaves (3-4” long) with finely serrated margins.  It is native to China and Japan.  It is winter hardy to and often grown outdoors year round in the southeastern U.S. plus Pacific coast areas.  It is the most commonly grown camellia species comprising thousands of cultivated varieties.  It is the state flower of Alabama.  The majority of the camellias grown at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis are grown indoors at the Linnean House.  Flower buds begin to form in mid-summer.  Buds appear in clusters.  Removing all but one bud per cluster will increase flower size.  Flowers (3-5” wide) bloom in mid-late winter (December to March) when grown outdoors in warm winter climates or in greenhouses, but bloom in early spring (April) when grown outdoors in the northern part of its growing range.  Species plants have single flowers, but cultivars with semidouble, anemone, peony, rose-form double, or formal double flower forms are available.  Each single flower has 5-8 petals.  Flower colors are most commonly white, pink or red with yellow anthers.  Flowers are borne at the tips of shoots or from lower leaf axils.  Rounded fruits (1 1/2” long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet is in reference to native territory of this species.
","
Problems
Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, black mold, flower blight, canker and root rot.  Scale can be a troublesome insect pest.  Aphids, thrips, mealybugs and mites may appear.  Yellow leaves may mean too little acidity in the soil.  Some flower bud dropping may be natural, but sometimes may be caused by overwatering or underwatering.  Limit pruning to removal of dead or damaged wood, unproductive branches, and disproportionately long shoots.  Shearing spoils the naturally attractive shape of the camellia.  Prune immediately after flowering or in early summer to stimulate branching.  Pruning later in the year can remove flower buds.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent flowering shrub for lawns, shrub borders, backgrounds, informal hedges and around homes in mild winter locations.  When grown outside their specified hardiness range, camellias are used primarily as conservatory plants, and they perform quite well in this environment.  Since they react badly to change (e.g., drop their buds), it is usually not recommended that they be moved outside in the summer months and then returned inside in the fall.  If possible, camellias should be grown in a brightly lit space that can accommodate their large spreading habit and be kept cool in the fall and winter to induce flowering.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this evergreen shrub is typically grown in acidic, organically rich, moderately but evenly moist, well-drained soils in part shade.  Plants typically thrive in the sun-dappled part shade conditions often found under the protection of tree canopies.  Plants are tolerant of full sun as long as soils are not allowed to dry out, but generally appreciate protection from hot sun and drying winds.  Application of a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark) is advisable.  Prune as needed to control size and shape after flowering.  

This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a), but will usually survive winters therein in years where temperatures do not dip below zero degrees F.  In the alternative, this plant may be grown in tubs or containers that are overwintered indoors in a greenhouse or in the bright cool conditions of a sunroom with slightly reduced watering.  

Most sasanqua camellias are commercially sold in pots or tubs.  When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to plant them with the soil level in the container even with the soil level of the ground.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Camellia sasanqua, commonly known as sasanqua camellia, is a densely branched, pyramidal to oval-rounded, tree-like, evergreen shrub that typically grows to 6-10’ tall.  It is native to Japan.  It is ornamentally noted for its attractive dark green foliage and fall to early winter flowers.  Lustrous, narrow-oval to obovate, dark green leaves (to 3” long) are cuneate and hairy on the midrib with rounded marginal teeth and pubescent petioles.  Stems (reddish when young) are covered with significant pubescence.  White to pale pink, 6-8 petaled, mildly aromatic flowers (2-3” diameter), each having a central mass of bright yellow-anthered stamens, bloom late summer to early winter depending on local climate.  Petals fall after several days but stamens remain, with additional flowers continuing to open in succession over a period of 4-6 weeks.  Flowers are followed by small rounded fruits.  Species flowers are single, but cultivar flowers often come in single, semi-double or double-flowered forms, with flower colors ranging primarily from white to red.  Fruit is a smooth and shiny capsule (to 3/4"" long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet comes from the Japanese name sasankua for a popular native species of Camellia.
","
Problems
Camellias are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases including leaf spots, anthracnose, viruses, black mold, petal blight, canker and root rot.  If petal blight occurs (browning that runs from edges to the center), all infected plant parts should be promptly removed.  Yellow leaves with green veins may indicate chlorosis which can be treated by adding  iron chelates to the soil.  Scale can be a troublesome insect pest.  Watch for aphids, planthoppers and spider mites.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this evergreen shrub is typically grown in organically rich, acidic, well-drained soils with consistent moisture in part shade locations. Established plants do well with moderate but even moisture. Plants appreciate protection from early morning sun and from direct hot afternoon sun. They often thrive in sun-dappled part shade conditions under the protection of tree canopies. Protection from strong winds is also important. Apply a root mulch (leaves or shredded bark). Prune after flowering to thin branching and to control size and shape. Most camellias are purchased in pots. When transplanting them into the garden, it is important to not plant them too deep (soil level in the ground should be the same as the soil level in the pot). This plant is not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6a). However, with protection and mild winter weather (temperatures that do not dip below zero degrees F), this camellia may survive winters outdoors in St. Louis. If attempted in St. Louis, this shrub should be grown in a sheltered and protected microclimate such as shaded areas near the south side of a home or building. Plants may be effectively grown in tubs or other large containers. Where not winter hardy, containers may be overwintered in a cool greenhouse where necessary growing conditions (including bright light and cool winter temperatures of 45-60 degrees F) can be met.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Processed leaves from Camellia sinensis and its many cultivars yield the tea leaves of commerce. Most commercial cultivation occurs in Asia (China to Burma and Sri Lanka). This camellia is also grown ornamentally for its excellent foliage and small but attractive fall flowers. It is probably native to China. It typically grows to 10-15' tall, but can easily be trimmed shorter (e.g., to 4-6' tall) or shaped as a hedge. Leathery, serrate, elliptic, glossy dark green leaves (to 5"" long) are evergreen. Fragrant white flowers (to 1 1/2"" across) with yellow stamens bloom in fall to early winter. Flowers are sometimes partially hidden by plant foliage. Fruit is a smooth and shiny capsule (to 3/4"" long).Genus name honors Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on Oriental plants.Specific epithet means Chinese.

Yellow leaves with green veins may indicate chlorosis which can be treated by adding iron/iron chelates to the soil. Scale can be a troublesome insect pest. Watch for aphids, planthoppers and spider mites.

Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, this flowering evergreen camellia makes an excellent addition to shady areas of the landscape such as woodland gardens, shrub borders, backgrounds, lawns and around homes. It may be grown as a specimen or in small groups, or it may be trimmed as a hedge. In St. Louis, experimental plantings must be sited in well-protected locations around houses, foundations and patios or in containers that can be overwintered in greenhouses. Excellent foliage and flowers can be fully appreciated without regard to the potential use of the leaves for tea.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Campanula rotundifolia, commonly called bluebell or harebell, is a rosette-forming, upright perennial that typically grows to 20"" tall. It is noted for producing attractive, bell-shaped, nodding blue flowers (each to 1/2"" long) that bloom singly or in small clusters from the stem tips throughout summer (June-September). This bluebell is native to a variety of different environments including meadows, grasslands, rocky slopes, crevices, alpine areas and sandy shores in the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. From a basal rosette of small, rounded, long-stalked, basal leaves (to 1"" wide) rise wiry, thread-like stems clad with narrow, alternate, linear leaves (each to 1-3"" long). Basal leaves usually wither early and disappear before the flowers form. This plant is also native to a small area in the Ozarks in Shannon County where it is found on north-facing limestone bluffs along the Jack's Fork River.Genus name comes from the Latin campana meaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet is in reference to the rounded basal leaves.This bluebell has a large number of common names. Harebell may relate to the fact that this plant is sometimes found in areas inhabited by rabbits (hares). This same plant grows in Scotland where it is popularly known as the bluebells of Scotland or Scotch bluebell.

Culture
Easily grown in a wide variety of soils. Best planted in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun to part shade. Foliage grows well in shade, but plants need good sun for best flowering. It blooms on new growth, so early spring pruning will not affect the flowering. Vines must be grown on sturdy structures because mature plants produce considerable weight. The problem with species plants (Campsis radicans) is usually not how to grow them but how to restrain them, in large part because they sucker profusely from underground runners and freely self-seed, often forming impenetrable colonies in the wild which can choke out many plants that get in their way.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Campsis radicans, commonly called trumpet vine or trumpet creeper, is a dense, vigorous, multi-stemmed, deciduous, woody, clinging vine that attaches itself to structures and climbs by aerial rootlets.  It is native to the southeastern U. S. including Missouri, but has naturalized in many northern states.  In Missouri, trumpet vine is native to the Ozark region, but has naturalized throughout the State where it now typically occurs in woods, thickets, fields and along streams, roadsides and railroad tracks (Steyermark).  Species plants rapidly grow to 30-40' high.  Compound, odd-pinnate leaves (to 15” long) are shiny dark green above and glabrous dull green below.  Each leaf has 7 to 11 elliptic to oblong leaflets (to 4"" long) with serrated margins.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Clusters (terminal cymes) of red trumpet-shaped flowers (to 3” long) appear throughout the summer (June to September).  Flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds.  Flowers are followed by long, bean-like seed pods (3-5” long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous 2-winged seeds for dispersal by the wind. Trumpet vine is also commonly known as cow-itch vine because some people experience skin redness and itching after coming in contact with the leaves.Genus name comes from the Greek word kampe meaning bent in reference to the bent stamens on plant flowers.Specific epithet means having rooting stems.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex pensylvanica, commonly called Pennsylvania sedge, is a shade-loving perennial sedge that is native to thickets and dry woodland areas in Eastern and Central North America from Quebec to Manitoba south to Mississippi and Georgia.  In Missouri, it is found mostly north of the Missouri River in dry to mesic upland forests and shaded bluff ledges (Steyermark).  It typically grows in loose colonies with a creeping habit.  Roots are reddish brown.  It is often found in areas with oak trees, hence the additional common name of oak sedge.  This is a low sedge with soft, delicate, arching, semi-evergreen leaves (each to 1/8""  wide).  It typically grows in a clump to 8"" tall.  It is semi-evergreen in moderately cold winter climates.  Narrow, grass-like, medium green leaves (to 8-12"" long) are typically shorter than the flowering stems.  Plants are monoecious (spikelets of male flowers above female flowers).  Flowers bloom in late spring (May) in inflorescences atop rough, sharply triangular culms (stems) which rise up singly from the rhizomes.  Staminate scales are green often tinged with reddish-purple with white margins.  Pistillate scales are dark brown to purplish black with green midribs and white margins.  Female flowers are followed by tiny fruits (achenes) enclosed in sac-like bracts (perigynia).  

Over 1500 species of Carex grow in a variety of habitats (often moist to wet areas) throughout the world.  Identification of individual species can be very difficult.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means of Pennsylvania, USA.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex radiata, commonly known as eastern star sedge (star-like flower clusters) or straight-styled wood sedge (tip of the female flower known as the style is straight rather than curled), is an evergreen perennial that typically produces a dense foliage clump to 8-12” tall of narrow, grass-like, medium green blades.  This sedge is native to mesic to wet-mesic bottomlands and upland forests and on moist ravine slopes, sometimes in seasonally wet locations, in eastern North America from Newfoundland to Manitoba south to Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Georgia.  

Ascending to wide-spreading, triangular culms (flower stems) rise above the foliage clump in spring to 20-28” tall.  Most culms are topped by an open, elongate, yellowish-green, terminal inflorescence (to 1-3” long) consisting of 3-8 flower spikelets.  Each spikelet contains a star-like cluster of 3-9 perigynia (perigynum is a scale-like bract which encloses each female flower).  Flowers bloom from April-May.  Male flowers, if present, are borne above the female flowers on the spikes (androgynous).   Female flowers are followed by tiny, ovate to obovate achenes which radiate outward from the stem in a star-like pattern.  Short rhizomes are poorly-developed. 
 
Carex radiata is very similar to and was formerly included in C. rosea.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet from Latin means radiating in reference to the developing seeds radiating outward from the stem.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carex stricta is a rhizomatous evergreen sedge that grows in dense tussocks (clumps) to 1-3' tall and to 2' wide. It is an emergent aquatic that is native primarily to wet swales, marshes, bogs, wet meadows and creek margins in eastern North America (Quebec to Ontario to North Dakota south to Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina). In Missouri, it is limited to several locations in calcareous, spring fed, swampy meadows in the Ozarks in the southeastern part of the State (Steyermark). Narrow, glaucous, grass-like leaves (to 3/8"" wide) grow in dense clumps. Older leaves turn straw brown as they die, and build up around the base of each clump surrounding the newer yellowish-green leaves. Flora of North America reports that plants grown in sites with seasonal flooding form distinctive large clumps, and plants grown in drier areas tend to spread more by rhizomes. Flowers appear in late spring in reddish-brown spikes atop stems rising above the foliage. Steyermark maintains that the scattered Missouri populations of this species are all that remains from an ancient Pleistocene presence that has gradually disappeared over time as the glaciers disappeared and the weather warmed.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means erect or upright.

Plants tolerate light shade if grown ornamentally instead of for fruit. In St. Louis, plants may be grown in large tubs that should be overwintered indoors in bright locations. Container plants may need to be replaced every 4-5 years. Papayas can be heavy feeders, so regular fertilization is necessary.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Carica papaya, commonly called papaya, is a small, frost-tender, succulent, broadleaf evergreen tree that bears papaya fruits throughout the year. Each tree (Hortus Third asserts papaya is technically a giant herb because it never produces true woody tissue) typically has a single, unbranched, non-woody trunk bearing the scars of old leaf bases. The trunk is topped by an umbrella-like canopy of palmately lobed leaves. Large, fleshy, melon-like fruits (papayas) hang in clusters attached to the trunk top just under the leaf canopy. Papaya typically grows to 6-20' tall (container plants to 10' tall) and is most noted for its edible melon-like fruit. It is native to lowland tropical areas of Central and South America, but is now grown in tropical to subtropical regions throughout the world both commercially and in home gardens. In the U.S., it is commercially grown in southern Florida, southern California and Hawaii. Seven lobed leaves (to 2' wide) on leaf stalks to 2-3' long are ornamentally attractive. Species plants are typically dioecious (separate male and female trees), but cultivars are hermaphroditic. Fragrant, trumpet-shaped, yellowish-white flowers bloom throughout the year, with males in long racemes and females in small clusters or solitary. Female flowers give way to smooth-skinned green fruits that ripen to yellow-orange with a yellow to pinkish-orange flesh and central cavity of pea-sized black seeds. Fruits and seeds are edible. Commercially sold fruits are typically 6-8"" long and weigh about one pound, but fruits in the wild in ideal growing conditions can grow much larger with a wieght of up to 20 pounds. Papain (an enzyme extracted from the milky sap of green fruit) is popularly used as a meat tenderizer, chewing gum additive and beer clarifier plus for a large number of additional medical, cosmetic and industrial purposes.Genus name comes from Greek meaning a kind of fig in reference to the fig-shaped leaves.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Carpinus caroliniana, commonly called American hornbeam, is a slow-growing, deciduous, small to medium-sized understory tree with an attractive globular form. It is native to Missouri where it is typically found in rich moist woods, valleys, ravine bottoms and rocky slopes along streams throughout the eastern and Ozark regions of the state (Steyermark). Typically grows 20-35' tall. The smooth, gray trunk and larger branches of a mature tree exhibit a distinctive muscle-like fluting that has given rise to another common name of musclewood for this tree. Flowers appear in spring in separate male and female catkins, with the female catkins giving way to distinctive clusters of winged nutlets. Serrated, elliptic-oval, dark green leaves often produce respectable shades of yellow, orange and red in fall. The extremely hard wood of this tree will, as the common name suggests, take a horn-like polish and was once used by early Americans to make bowls, tool handles and ox yokes. Commercial use of hornbeam wood is not practicable, however, due to the limited amount of wood that can be harvested per tree.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name.Specific epithet means of North or South Carolina.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cassia fistula, commonly called golden shower tree, is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to 30-40' tall in an upright form often open at the top.  It is native to India, Malaysia and Southeast Asia.  It is well-known for producing a show-stopping bloom of yellow flowers in May-June/July.  Even pinnate compound leaves to 12-16"" long with 4-8 pairs of ovate-lanceolate leaflets (each leaflet to 4"" long) per leaf.  Leaves usually drop in April as a prelude to flowering which occurs from May to early July.  Five-petaled, bright yellow flowers bloom in 8-18"" pendulous terminal racemes which cover the tree with profuse bloom.  Flowers are lightly scented.  Leaves return as the flowering progresses, with foliage totally restored by July.  Tree is often considered to be semi-deciduous or semi-evergreen because of this brief loss of leaves.  A second less significant bloom often occurs in September but without loss of leaves.  Flowers are followed by slender, terete, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long.  Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year.  Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.  Golden shower tree is the National tree of Thailand and the national flower of Thailand.  Popular plant as ornamental and for herbal medicine.  Dried fruit has medicinal properties.  Is now widely grown in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet means hollow like a pipe.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some tolerance for brief light frost with temperatures to 25 degrees F.  Mildew and leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Ornamental.  Shade tree.  Formerly planted in some populated areas as a street tree, but this use has waned as planners have shifted to using Cassia x nealiae for this purpose because this hybrid does not drop as many leaves at flowering time and does not produce any seed pods.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cassia leptophylla, commonly called gold medallion tree, is a small open-crowned tree with spreading, slightly drooping branches.  It typically matures to 20-30' tall.   It is native to Brazil.  It is noted for producing large pinnate leaves, a showy display of yellow flowers in summer and large bean-like seed pods following the flowers.  This tree is now grown primarily as an ornamental in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.  It is noted for performing better in the climate of the State of California than other species of Cassia.  Each even-pinnate compound leaf (to 12-18"" long) has 9-14 pairs of small narrow leaflets (each to 2.5"" long).  This tree is considered to be semi-evergreen (drops some leaves during the year, sometimes in tropical climates having dry seasons and sometimes in winter if extended cool weather or a tinge of frost occurs).  This tree is particularly noted for producing a show-stopping bloom of fragrant yellow flowers (2-3"" wide) arranged in 6-10"" long terminal clusters (racemes), each containing 30-50 flowers.  Flowers bloom in summer sometimes extending into early fall.  Flowers are followed by slender, twisted, woody bean pods which grow to 2' long.  Pods emerge green but mature to black, remaining on the tree until the following year.  Sticky brown pulp inside the pods has been used in herbal medicines.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a genus of leguminous plants which provide the senna leaves and pods important in pharmacy.Specific epithet comes from Greek leptos meaning narrow and phyllon meaning leaf in reference to the narrow leaves of this tree.

Culture
Grow in moist, well-drained loams in full sun. Species plants should not be planted as ornamentals due to susceptibility to blight. Research is ongoing for developing disease resistant varieties.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Castanea dentata, commonly called American chesnut, was once a major component of the Eastern hardwood forest. It is almost extinct in the wild now, having succumbed to chestnut blight, a bark fungal disease that probably entered the U.S. in a shipment of nursery stock from Japan in the late 1890s. American chestnut now persists mostly in the form of sprouts from old stumps and root systems. Typically the sprouts grow up and possibly flower and fruit for several years before dying back from the blight. Before blight introduction, mature trees typically reached 50-75’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with globular spreading crowns. Oblong-lanceolate, toothed, dull green leaves (6-10” long) turn shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic creamy yellow-white male flowers are densely clustered in slender catkins (4-8” long). Female flowers appear in smaller inconspicuous catkins. Blooms in June. Small nuts (hazel nut size) are sweet and edible, and are encased in spiny burrs (2-3” diameter). H. W. Longfellow’s poem “The Village Blacksmith” begins with the line “Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands….” in reference to this once stately and popular American tree.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet means toothed in reference to the toothed leaves.
","
Problems
Chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica formerly Endothia parasitica). Also susceptible to leaf spots, anthracnose and powdery mildew.
","

Culture
Grow in moist, well-drained, loams in full sun. Tolerant of summer heat and humidity. Established trees do well in dry conditions. If growing this tree at least in part for its edible nuts, planting more than one tree facilitates cross-pollination and generally produces a more abundant nut crop.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Castanea mollissima, commonly called Chinese chestnut, is native to China and possibly Korea. It is a medium sized, low-branched, deciduous tree that typically grows 40’ (less frequently to 60’) tall with an open rounded crown. It is grown as an ornamental tree and/or for its edible nuts. It is noted for its resistance to chestnut blight which has nearly wiped out the native American chestnut (Castanea dentata). Chinese chestnut features oblong-lanceolate, coarsely toothed, dark green leaves (5-8” long) that are soft green and pubescent beneath. Leaves turn varying shades of yellow in fall. Aromatic monoecious creamy yellowish-white flowers appear in catkins in late spring (June in St. Louis), the male flowers located at the top portion of the catkin and the female flowers located near the base. Flowers can be quite showy, albeit for a brief period. Flowers are followed by edible chestnuts which are encased in spiny dehiscent burs (2-3” diameter), usually 2-3 nuts per bur. Although Chinese chestnuts are sometime sold in farmers’ markets, it is the Spanish chestnut, Castanea sativa, that produces the chestnuts most often sold commercially.Genus name comes from the Latin name for this tree which was derived from the town of Castania in Thessaly where the trees reportedly grew in abundance.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word for soft, in reference to the pubescent twigs and leaf undersides.
","
Problems
Chinese chestnut is resistant, but not immune, to chestnut blight (Endothia parasitica) which is a fatal fungal bark disease. Also susceptible to leaf spot, anthracnose and twig and stem cankers. Weevils can be a problem in some areas.
","
Garden Uses
A beautiful specimen shade tree for lawns. Unfortunately, as is the case with the fruit of the sweet gum but perhaps more so, falling chestnuts can pose a significant litter problem, and often make walking barefoot in the lawn a real adventure. On the positive side, the chestnuts may be harvested for roasting on an open fire as it were.

Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions including both wet and dry soils. Tolerant of seasonal flooding. Prefers moist fertile loams.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Catalpa speciosa, commonly called northern catalpa, is a medium to large, deciduous tree that typically grows to 40-70’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with an irregular, open-rounded to narrow-oval crown. It is native to a relatively small area extending from western Tennessee, northeastern Arkansas and the lowlands of southeastern Missouri north to southern Illinois and southern Indiana. In Missouri, it typically occurs along streams, bluff bases and in both low and upland woods (Steyermark). Broad ovate to ovate-oblong leaves (to 12” long) are pointed at the tips and rounded to cordate at the bases. Leaves are light green to yellow green above and densely pubescent below. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow in fall. Flowers can be a real showstopper, however. Bell-shaped, orchid-like white flowers (to 2” long) with purple and yellow inner spotting appear in panicles in late spring (late May to early June in St. Louis). Flowers give way to long slender green seedpods (12-22” long). The seedpods mature in fall to dark brown and then split open lengthwise to release the seeds within. Seedpods give rise to the common name of cigar tree, although they actually are longer and thinner than most cigars. Abundant pods are produced every 2 to 3 years. Bark of mature trees is fissured, prominently ridged and pale gray-brown. The leaves of this species do not emit an unpleasant aroma when bruised as is the case with the similar southern catalpa (Catalpa bignonioides).Genus name comes from a North American Indian name.Specific epithet means showy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to verticillium wilt, leaf spots, mildew and twig blight. The larvae (caterpillars) of the catalpa sphinx moth may do considerable damage when feeding on the leaves.
","
Garden Uses
A mature, symmetrically rounded catalpa tree can be a tree of great beauty, particularly in spring when the foliage is young and the flowers are in bloom. Unfortunately, it is otherwise a rather coarse tree that many believe does not deserve a prominent place in the landscape. Branches are brittle and mature trees infrequently exhibit classic form. Foliage also tends to depreciate as the growing season progresses, the large leaves being subject to damage from hail, wind, insects and sometime disease. It has been widely planted in urban areas as a street tree and lawn tree, and can also be effectively used in the landscape for difficult areas such as moist low spots or dry areas with poor soils.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Catananche caerulea, commonly called Cupid’s dart, is a short-lived, clump-forming perennial of the aster family. Blue to lavender-blue flowers (to 2” diameter) with dark centers bloom singly on naked wiry stems rising to 2’ tall from a mostly basal clump of narrow, lanceolate, grass-like, gray-green leaves (each 8-12” long). Each flower is subtended by overlapping papery bracts. Flowers bloom freely from mid-summer to autumn. Early Greeks and Romans used this Mediterranean native to make love potions, hence the genus name and common name of Cupid’s dart.Genus name comes from the Greek name meaning a strong incentive.Specific epithet means dark blue in reference to flower color.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Catharanthus roseus, commonly called periwinkle, Madagascar periwinkle or annual vinca, is an erect to spreading tender perennial in the dogbane family typically mounding 6-18” (less frequently to 24”) tall and as wide. It produces attractive bushy foliage that is covered by an often profuse bloom of phlox-like flowers from summer to frost. Best flowering is in summer. Tubular flowers have five flattened petal-like lobes and appear singly in the upper leaf axils. Species flowers are rosy-pink to red with mauve throats. However, species plants are seldom seen in commerce today, having been largely replaced by larger flowered cultivars, many of which are dwarf to compact plants that sometimes have overlapping petals. Cultivars expand the available color range to include pale pink, rose, hot pink, red, lilac, and white, often with contrasting darker throats/eyes. Oblong to ovate glossy green leaves (to 2” long).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cedrus deodara, know as Deodar cedar, is an evergreen conifers that is pyramidal when young, maturing to flat-topped trees with broad-spreading horizontal branching. Deodar cedar is perhaps the most pendulous of the true cedars, with drooping branchlets and branching that is gracefully drooping at the tips. Lower branches typically remain on the tree as it ages, often touching the ground. This is a medium-growing tree that typically matures to 40-50’ tall in its first 25 years. In its native habitat, trees reportedly will grow much taller over time, sometimes reaching 150-200’ tall. Dark grayish-green needles (to 1.25” long) appear in clusters. Upright cones (to 4” long). It is native to the Himalayas.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet comes from the North Indian name of this plant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Tip blight and root rot may occur. Winter hardiness is a concern in the St. Louis area where consideration should be given to planting a cultivar such as ‘Shalimar’ that has slightly better hardiness than the species.

Culture
Easily grown in most soils. Best in lean to average soils with regular moisture in full sun. Lean soils help restrain growth. Will grow in part shade, but needs full sun for best flowering and subsequent fruit display. Prune in late winter to early spring. Mature vines require little pruning other than removal of dead or excess growth. These plants are primarily dioecious (separate male and female plants), although some have a few perfect flowers. Female plants need a male pollinator to produce the attractive fruit that is the signature of this vine. Unfortunately, some nurseries do not sell the vines as male or female (as is commonly done with hollies). Generally one male plant is needed for 6-9 female plants. Female plants may be vegetatively propagated to create more female plants. Vines may be grown on structures or allowed to ramble along the ground. It is generally best to avoid growing vines up small trees or through shrubs because vines grow rapidly and can girdle trunks and branches causing damage and sometimes death. Vines sucker at the roots to form large colonies in the wild. Vines will also self-seed, often with assistance from local bird populations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Celastrus scandens, commonly called American bittersweet, is a deciduous twining woody vine that is best known for its showy red berries that brighten up fall and winter landscapes. This species is native to central and eastern North America including Missouri. In Missouri, bittersweet is typically found in woodland areas, thickets, rocky slopes, bluffs, glade peripheries and along fence rows throughout the State (Steyermark). It is often seen growing along the ground, over and through low shrubs or circling trees in the wild. Berry-laden branches are prized for use as indoor decorations, and collection of the branches in the wild has significantly reduced the wild populations in some areas. Rapidly grows to 20’. It produces serrate, elliptic to ovate, yellowish-green leaves (to 4” long). Staminate and pistillate flowers appear in clusters on separate plants in late spring. Flowers are greenish-white to yellow. Fertilized female flowers give way in summer to spherical orange-yellow fruits. Fruits split open in fall to reveal scarlet fleshy berry-like seeds (arils). Fruits are poisonous if ingested, but are considered to be quite tasty by many birds. In the 1700s, plants were given the name bittersweet by European colonists because their fruits purportedly resembled in appearance the fruits of a Eurasian nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) that was known to them as bittersweet. The common name of false bittersweet also came to be used for the within species to distinguish it from the Eurasian nightshade. American bittersweet is the generally accepted common name that is used today, in large part to distinguish this American native from its aggressive Asiatic relative, C. orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) which has escaped cultivation and is naturalizing in parts of eastern and central North America.Genus name comes from the Greek word kelastros for an evergreen tree.Specific epithet means climbing.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Euonymus scale and two-marked treehoppers may cause significant damage in some areas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Celtis laevigata, commonly called sugarberry, sugar hackberry or southern hackberry, is basically a southern version of common or northern hackberry (see C. occidentalis). Sugarberry differs from common hackberry inter alia by (1) fruits are juicier and sweeter, (2) bark is less corky, (3) leaves are narrower with mostly smooth margins, (4) better resistance to witches’ broom and (5) less winter hardiness. Sugarberry is a medium to large sized deciduous tree that typically grows 60-80’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with upright-arching branching and a rounded spreading crown. Trunk diameter ranges from 1-3’ (less frequently to 4’). This tree is native to and widely distributed throughout the southeast and south central U.S. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist to wet soils along streams and floodplains mostly south of the Missouri River except for the Ozark region. (Steyermark). Mature gray bark develops a warty texture. Insignificant, mostly monoecious, greenish flowers appear in spring (April –May), with male flowers in clusters and female flowers solitary. Female flowers give way to an often abundant fruit crop of round fleshy berry-like drupes maturing to deep purple. Each drupe has one round brown seed within. Fruits are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Birds consume the fruits and disperse the seeds. Fleshy parts of the fruit are edible and sweet. Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, rough-textured, untoothed, glossy to dull green leaves (2-4” long) have mostly uneven leaf bases. Undistinguished yellow fall color.Genus name comes from the Greek name for another tree.Specific epithet means smooth.
","
Problems
Hackberry nipple gall is so common in the St. Louis area that it is often used as an aid in identifying hackberries. Although the galls do not hurt these trees, they often significantly disfigure the leaves. Sugarberry has good resistance to witches’ broom (dwarfed, dense, contorted twig clusters at the branch ends). Powdery mildew and leaf spot may occur. Watch for lacebugs and scale.

Culture
Easily grown in average, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Addition of sand to the soil helps promote good drainage. Plants prefer cool summer climates and do not perform well south of USDA Zone 7. Mature plants tolerate dryish soils. Avoid wet soils. Plants may be grown from seed, and may escape gardens/naturalize by self-seeding, but are not considered invasive as is the case with some of the knapweeds. Stems may flop on taller plants. Cut flowering stems back after bloom is completed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centaurea dealbata, commonly called Persian cornflower or knapweed, is native to Iran and the Caucasus. It is a clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 24-30"" tall with a spread to 24"" wide. Pinnately-lobed basal foliage (to 18-24"" long) is dark green above with whitish hairs underneath. Cornflower-like, lavender to rosy pink flowers (2-3"" diameter), each flower having a deeply fringed ring of outer petals surrounding a center of paler inner petals, bloom from late spring to early summer atop stems clad with small, entire, sessile, upper leaves. Each flower head has distinctive involucre bracts. Flowers are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek word kentauros meaning centaur.Specific epithet means whitened for covered with opaque white powder.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Centranthus ruber, commonly called red valerian or Jupiter’s beard, is a well-branched, bushy, clump-forming, woody-based perennial which is valued for its ability to produce, often in poor soils, a showy bloom of star-shaped crimson, pink or white flowers from spring to frost.  Although native to the Mediterranean, this plant has escaped gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the United States, particularly along the west coast.  Flowers (each to 1/2"") appear in dense terminal clusters (cymes) atop upright to relaxed stems rising above the foliage to 1.5-3' tall.  Flowers are fragrant.  If not deadheaded, flowers give way to dandelion-like seed heads which are typically disbursed around the landscape by wind.  Fleshy, sessile, oval to lanceolate leaves (to 4"" long) are gray-green.Genus name comes from the Greek words kentron meaning a spur and anthos meaning a flower for the spurred flower.Specific epithet means red in reference to flower color of species plants.

Best grown in moist, sandy, well-drained soils in shady areas of the landscape. Tolerates shady conditions better than most needled evergreens. Tolerates full sun in cool summers, but prefers part shade conditions in areas with hot summers. Plants have good heat tolerance. Established plants tolerate some drought. Plants are not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they should be planted in protected locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cephalotaxus harringtonia, commonly called plum yew, is a dioecious coniferous evergreen that typically grows as a shrub to 5-10’ tall, but may be trained as a tree that could eventually rise to as much as 20-30’ tall. Growth is slow, however, and it often takes as much as 10 years for a plant to reach 4’ tall.  It is native to shaded woodland areas in Japan, northeastern China and Korea.  Linear, spirally-arranged, yew-like, evergreen leaves (to 1.5” long) appear in a v-shaped pattern on erect stems, many of which rise up from the base of the plant.  Female flowers produce fleshy, edible, plum-like fruits (to 1"" long).  If fruits are desired, female plants with at least one male pollinator are required for fruit production to occur.  Excellent tolerance for both shade and hot weather make this species an interesting substitute in the southeastern U.S. for true yews (Taxus) that usually struggle south of USDA Zone 7.The genus name Cephalotaxus comes from the Greek words kephale meaning ""head"" and Taxus meaning ""yew"" for its resemblance to yews (Genus Taxus).Specific epithet honors the Earl of Harrington who became an early enthusiast for the species after its introduction to Europe in the 1820s.Plants are commonly called plum yews because the fruits on female plants resemble tiny plums and the foliage resembles that of yews (Taxus).

Culture
Best grown in dry, sandy, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a somewhat wide range of soils except poorly-drained ones which inevitably lead to root rot.  Grows well in cool summer climates.  Plants are winter hardy to USDA Zone 2.  Intolerant of the high summer heat and humidity of the deep South.  Spreads by runners to fill in areas, but is not considered to be invasive in the hot St. Louis climate where it is less robust than in cooler northern climates.  Plants will self-seed in the garden if spent blooms are not removed.  Best to shear off flower stems after bloom in order to prevent self-seeding, reduce future foliage decline,  and shape/neaten the foliage mat.  Large beds can be mowed on a high setting.  Divide every year if needed to help maintain compact size of the mat.  Starter plants may be planted 9-12” apart to quickly cover large areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cerastium tomentosum, known as snow-in-summer, is a short-lived, low-growing, mat-forming perennial which is typically massed in sunny locations as a ground cover.  Tufts of narrow, gray-green leaves (each to 1"" long and 1/4"" wide) form a 6” tall foliage mat.  Leaves are evergreen.  In late spring, flower stems rise above the foliage mat (typically to 8-12”) carrying clusters (cymes) of white blooms which form a snow-like carpet (hence the common name).  Flowers (to 1” diameter) have 5 notched petals and are similar in appearance and closely related to several of the chickweeds.  Less invasive, more compact cultivars of this species usually make better garden plants.Genus name comes from the Greek word keras meaning horn in reference to the seed capsule which in some species is bent slightly like a cow’s horn.Specific epithet is in reference to the plant's woolly white leaves and stems.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Damping off may occur in climates with high humidity or locations with too much shade.  Root rot can be a serious problem if plants are grown in poorly-drained soils or in soils that remain wet.  Plants are short-lived, and dead patches often begin to appear after several years.  In St. Louis, foliage usually declines as the summer progresses.
","
Garden Uses

Noteworthy Characteristics
Ceratostigma plumbaginoides, commonly called plumbago or leadwort, is a wiry, mat-forming perennial which spreads by rhizomes to form an attractive ground cover. Typically grows 6-10"" tall on generally erect stems rising from the rhizomes. Oval to obovate, shiny, medium green leaves (to 2"" long) turn bronze-red in autumn. Terminal clusters of 5-petaled, gentian blue flowers (1/2 to 3/4"" diameter) appear above the foliage over a long summer to frost bloom period. Flowers resemble those of woodland phlox.Genus name comes from the Greek words keras meaning a horn and stigma from the hornlike projection on the stigma of the flower.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Plumbago.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Will spread.
","
Garden Uses
Late, long-flowering plant serves as excellent ground cover for sunny to partly shaded areas in the landscape. A good plant for interplanting with spring bulbs because foliage emerges late as the bulb foliage is dying back. Underplanting for shrubs. Edger. May be used in rock gardens or border fronts with careful monitoring of spread. As a ground cover, plumbago would probably be as extensively planted as vinca, pachysandra or English ivy, except for the fact that it lacks their evergreen foliage.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cercidiphyllum japonicum, commonly called katsura tree, is native to Japan and China.  It is a deciduous, single or multi-trunked, understory tree with a dense, rounded habit that typically matures to 40-60’ tall in cultivation, but can reach 100’ or more in the wild.  It is grown for its beautiful shape and its attractive foliage.  Cordate, round-oval leaves (to 4” long) resemble those of a small redbud (Cercis is the redbud genus and phyllon is Greek for leaf).  Leaves emerge reddish purple in spring, mature to medium green with a slight bluish tinge in summer and turn quality shades of gold, orange and red in fall.  Although not aromatic, the fallen autumn leaves have been varyingly described as smelling of cinnamon, burnt sugar or ripe apples.  Tiny flowers (red on male trees and green on female trees) appear in spring before the foliage but are not particularly showy.  Pollinated flowers on female trees are followed by clusters of greenish pods (to 3/4” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words kerkis meaning redbud or Judas tree and phyllon meaning a leaf for its appearance to redbud (Cercis.)Specific epithet means of Japan.

Dividing clumps or removing suckers can be difficult.  Specimens purchased in pots from nurseries are often reasonably priced.  In colder areas where plants are not winter hardy, they may be grown in containers which can be brought indoors and overwintered in cool, bright sunny locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Chamaerops humilis, commonly known as Mediterranean fan palm or European fan palm, is a single- to multiple-trunked  evergreen palm with an upright irregular form that typically matures as a shrub or small tree growing to 6-15’ tall with a spread to 6-20’ wide.  It often suckers from the base of the main trunk to form a clump of 8-10 trunks, but it can be easily trained to grow with a single trunk by regularly removing the suckers.  It is the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world, and the only palm that is native to Europe.  Notwithstanding its outdoor growth potential, it typically matures to only 5’ tall when grown indoors in containers.  It is native to rocky hills and mountains of the western Mediterranean Basin from Africa’s Atlas Mountains in Morocco, Algeria and Tunesia to Spain, Portugal, France and Italy.    

Huge, distinctive, triangular, fine-textured, palmate-compound leaves are ornamentally attractive.  Each leaf (to 24” long and as wide) has 10-20 narrow, finger-like, deeply divided leaflets which are arranged in the shape of a fan at the end of a spiny petiole (leaf stalk to 3-4’ long), hence the common name of fan palm.  Leaves are variable in both color (light blue green to silver green) and shape (shrub to small tree).  Bright yellow flowers bloom in spring, but are typically hidden from view behind the leaf stems.  Flowers are followed by dark yellow, orange or brown fruits that ripen in fall.  Flowers and fruits are somewhat inconspicuous and not showy.  Trunks on mature palms are covered with a dark mat of fibers and old leaf bases.

Var. humilis includes the type strain of the species.Genus name comes from the Greek words chamai meaning dwarf and rhops meaning a bush.Specific epithet from Latin means low-growing.

In warmer areas where outdoor cultivation is possible, grow in light shade in well-drained soil. Indoor plants need bright indirect sunlight and watering well when in full growth. Keep moderately moist and temperatures above 45°F. Ideal temperatures are between 55° and 70°. Do not over fertilize as heavily fertilized plants may not form as many new plantlets. Your plants will not run short of nutrients; its tubers store reserve food. Cut off yellowed foliage and brown tips which will occur unless conditions are perfect. Plantlets form when the spider plant receives short days and long, uninterrupted nights for at least three weeks. This plant has fleshy tuberous roots, so it will need to be divided and repotted before the roots burst your container, especially plastic containers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Chlorophytum comosum is native to South Africa. It has linear leaves that are green or striped white. Flowering stems bear loose panicles of small, white, starry flowers. Plantlets are formed at the flowering nodes. When plants are full, they have an interesting, graceful, cascading habit.Genus name comes from the Greek words chloros meaning green and phyton meaning a plant.Specific epithet means furnished with a tuft.‘Variegatum’ has margins of white or cream. ‘Vittatum’ has recurved leaves with a central white stripe and green margins.
","
Problems
Plants are susceptible to root rot if waterlogged, whiteflies, spider mites, scales and aphids. Leaf tips turn brown from too little water, too low humidity, too much salts and excess of fluorides in the water. The foliage will also scald if placed in direct sun. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In warmer climates or during summer months in colder areas, spider plants are well-suited to use in planters or as a groundcover. The plantlets will cascade over a wall or planter forming a fountain effect. The variegated cultivars brighten up any shaded locations. It can be used as an edging along walks or in front of shrub borders. As an indoor plant, it is used primarily in baskets. It tolerates artificial light very well and therefore makes an excellent plant for offices and commercial settings.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus histrix, commonly called Thai lime or makrut lime, is a thorny, multi-stemmed, evergreen shrub or small tree of the citrus family that grows to 6-25’ tall.  It is primarily native to Southeast Asia, but has widely naturalized in tropical areas with the specific location of its original distribution uncertain.  Glossy, aromatic, double (two-parted), evergreen leaves from this tree are commonly shredded for use as a flavoring in a variety of Southeast Asian food dishes including soups, curries, rice, stir-fry, fish cakes, salads and marinades.  Leaves may be harvested from home grown plants or purchased fresh or dried at Asian or specialty groceries.  Four to five petalled white flowers are fragrant.  Flowers are followed by rough bumpy green fruits (limes to 2” wide) which have a highly acidic flavor but little juice, so the juice and pulp is infrequently used in cooking.  Fruit rinds are sour tasting, but often used for flavoring in a diced-up or grated form.Genus name is from classical Latin.Specific epithet comes from the Greek word hustrix meaning hedgehog in reference to the thorns present on this plant.Many authorities prefer the common name of Thai lime or makrut lime to Kaffir lime because of the insulting and derogatory meaning of the word kaffir in some parts of the world (e.g., an insult used by some South African whites for blacks).

Noteworthy Characteristics
Citrus maxima, commonly called pummelo, is a parent of the grapefruit (C. sinensis x C. maxima).  It is probably native to Thailand, but some experts say Polynesia and the Malay Peninsula.  Today it is a very popular fruit in Southeast Asia and China.  Some limited commercial growth takes place in the U.S. today (Florida, California and Hawaii).  The fruit of this tree is huge, typically growing to 6-9"" (less frequently to 12"") in diameter.  Weight is typically 2-4 pounds, but infrequently can mushroom to as much as 15 pounds.  Fruits are pear-shaped with a thick rind.  Taste of the fruit is reminiscent of grapefruit, but sweet instead of sour with less juice.  Edible flesh is white, yellow or pink.  Pummelo typically grows to 15-20' tall with a rounded crown.  In optimum growing conditions it may rise to as much as 50' tall.  Ovate to elliptic leaves (4-8"" long) are evergreen.  Solitary or clustered white flowers (each to 1 1/3"" long) may bloom up to four times per year in ideal conditions, resulting in fruit being present on the tree almost year round.

Culture
Use a trellis to train this vine in the house. To grow glory-bower or bleeding heart vine indoors, a winter rest is required. This can be accomplished by moving the vine to a cooler location away from any heat source. A spot between 60 to 65F during the day and 5 to 10 degrees lower at night would be ideal. Some leaf drop is a normal response to entering winter dormancy. During this period, water just enough to keep the soil from drying out and withhold fertilizer. In late winter or early spring, prune the vine before new growth emerges. Because flower buds are produced on current season’s growth, pruning at this time will encourage the production of vigorous flowering shoots. Do not be afraid to prune severely. Thin out old, overcrowded shoots and any other far-reaching growth to keep the vine in bounds. After pruning, move the plant to a warm, brightly lit location or outdoors if temperatures have warmed sufficiently. Water when the soil surface feels dry.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cocos nucifera, commonly called coconut or coconut palm, is a tall tree that is native to tropical islands in the western Pacific.  It has been commonly planted in frost free tropical areas throughout the world in a variety of conspicuous locations including coastal areas, beaches, parks, along streets, residential yards, near commercial buildings/hotels, and on golf courses.  In the U. S., it will grow in southern Florida, the southern tip of Texas and Hawaii.  It does not perform well in southern California.  Trees will typically mature to 50-100' tall over time.  This is a single-trunked palm with a branchless, often-curved, light gray trunk which is swollen at the base and topped by a crown of pinnate, downward-arching, green fronds (to 15-20' long).  Fragrant yellow flowers in elongated clusters to 4' long only appear in tropical climates where they bloom on and off throughout the year.  Female flowers are followed by single-seeded coconuts (to 14"" long).  Each coconut has a fibrous husk which surrounds a woody shell containing the coconut meat, milk and oil which are used in numerous food products around the world.  Drinkable coconut water is the liquid inside green coconuts.  Coconut milk is produced by grating the matue coconut meat, mixing it with water and then squeezing. Coconut meat can be eaten raw or cooked.  Dried coconut meat (copra) is crushed to obtain coconut oil with residue sometimes added to animal feed.  Coconut oil is used in cooking, cosmetics, soaps and margarine.  The growing tip of this palm can be harvested and marketed under the name of heart of palm, but harvesting kills the plant.   Other plant parts have a variety of uses, particularly in the Far East, including trunk (construction), fronds (weaving, baskets, thatching), endosperm (cosmetics) and sap (palm sugar or toddy).Genus name comes from the Portuguese word coco meaning mask.Specific epithet means bearing nuts.
","
Problems
Lethal yellowing is a serious disease which has killed thousands of coconut palms in Florida.  It is spread by a leaf hopper.  Injections help stabilize plants but will not cure the disease.  Resistant varieties are being developed.  Insect pest problems include palm leaf skeletonizer, aphids, nematodes and scale.  Spider mites.

Plants may also be grown as pond marginals in up to 6"" of standing water. Plants produce prodigious amounts of growth and appreciate regular fertilization during the growing season. Site plants in locations protected form strong winds. Tubers may be left in the ground year-round in USDA Zones 8-10. In St. Louis, however, tubers should be planted in the ground in mid-spring (after April 20), dug up in fall after first frost and then overwintered in a cool dry location (set in dry peat or wood shavings) where temperatures do not dip below 45 degrees F, in somewhat the same manner as done for cannas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Colocasia esculenta, commonly called taro, is a tuberous, stemless, frost-tender perennial of the arum family (see also calla lily and jack-in-the-pulpit) which typically grows 3-6' tall and as wide. For gardeners, it is primarily grown as a foliage plant with huge, heart-shaped to arrowhead-shaped, conspicuously-veined, downward-pointing, peltate leaves (to 2' long) on long, stout, succulent stems. As the common name suggests, each leaf purportedly resembles an elephant's ear. Calla lily-like flowers with yellowish-white spathes and spadixes are infrequently produced and usually hidden by the foliage when they do occur. This species is also commercially grown as a food crop in Hawaii (poi is made from the tubers) where it is commonly called taro.Genus name comes from the Greek word kolokasia used for the root of Nelumbo nucifera.Specific epithet means edible or good to eat.

Culture
Easily grown in moist, fertile, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Performs well in sun-dappled shade.  In optimum growing conditions, it will spread rapidly by rhizomes, almost to the point of being weedy, to form dense colonies in the landscape. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, including dry and clay soils. This is a long-lived plant which naturalizes easily in woodland areas and may be left undisturbed for many years.  Flowering may decrease over time, however, at which point dividing the plants may become appropriate.  This is a cool weather perennial which is not recommended for growing in hot and humid summer climates south of USDA Zone 7a where it will perform poorly.  May easily be propagated in spring or fall by root division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Convallaria majalis, commonly known as lily-of-the-valley, is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial that that typically forms an indefinitely-spreading ground cover to 8-12” tall.  It is native to Europe, but has escaped cultivation and naturalized over time throughout much of temperate eastern and central North America plus parts of the Northwestern U.S.  Foliage and flowers make this an attractive and beloved shade garden wildflower.  Each plant has 2 to 3 parallel-veined lanceolate-ovate to elliptic green leaves (to 5-10” long and to 1-3” wide).  In spring, an erect to slightly arching flowering stem rises from the center of each leaf clump bearing a one-sided raceme (to 4-9” long) of nodding, bell-shaped, sweetly fragrant, white flowers (corollas to 1/3” long) which bloom in early to mid-spring.  Each raceme typically contains 5-10 flowers.  Globoid orange-red berries may appear in fall, each berry containing 1-6 seeds.

All parts of this plant are very poisonous because they contain cardiac glycosides.Genus name comes from the Latin word convallis meaning a valley.Specific epithet means of or belonging to May in reference to the month of flowering.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Watch for aphids and spider mites.  Stem rot, leaf spot, leaf blotch and anthracnose may appear but usually are not significant deterrents to growing this plant.  Foliage decline will occur in hot summers. Deer tend to avoid this plant.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus alternifolia is a small deciduous tree or large multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-25’ tall with distinctive tiered/layered horizontal branching which is upward-turned at the tips.  It is native to both moist and dry forests, forest margins, stream banks and fields from Newfoundland to Minnesota south to northern Arkansas and through the Appalachians to Georgia and Alabama.  Small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers bloom in flattened cymes (each to 2 1/2"" across) in late spring (May-June).  Flowers give way to bluish-black fruits (drupes) on red stalks.  Fruits mature in late summer.  Elliptic-ovate, medium green leaves (to 3-5” long) turn reddish-purple often tinted yellow or green in fall.  Although the leaves of most species of dogwood are opposite, those of pagoda dogwood are alternate, hence the specific epithet and often used common name of alternate-leaf dogwood.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the alternate arrangement of the leaves.Common name of pagoda dogwood is in reference to the tiered horizontal branching.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus canadensis, commonly known as dwarf cornel or bunchberry, is a shrubby deciduous ground cover that typically grows to 4- 9” tall and spreads in the landscape by creeping rhizomes.  This dwarf species of dogwood produces the same shaped leaves and flowers found on the familiar Cornus florida tree except in smaller size.  In North America, it is primarily native to coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests throughout Canada and the northern U.S., south in the Appalachians to Virginia and in the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico.  This is a circumpolar species which is also native to eastern Asia.  

Conspicuously-veined, oval to elliptic, glossy, medium to dark green leaves (to 1-2” long) are located near the stem tops in false whorls of 4-6.  Red to purple fall color.  Flowers emerge in late spring.  Each flower consists of a tiny greenish-yellow umbel surrounded by four showy, oval, petal-like white bracts (each bract to 1” long).  Flowers give way to terminal clusters of berry-like drupes (1/4” diameter) which ripen in August to bright red with good persistence on the plant until late fall unless earlier consumed by birds.  Drupes are edible for humans.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is in reference to the native habitat of this plant which includes Canada.Common name of dwarf cornel refers to the red fruits which resemble in color the semi-precious gemstone carnelian (or cornelian).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus florida, commonly known as flowering dogwood, is a small deciduous tree that typically grows 15-30’ tall with a low-branching, broadly-pyramidal but somewhat flat-topped habit.  It arguably may be the most beautiful of the native American flowering trees.  It is native from Maine to southern Ontario to Illinois to Kansas south to Florida, Texas and Mexico.  It is the state tree of Missouri and Virginia.  It blooms in early spring (April) shortly after, but usually overlapping, the bloom period of the redbuds.  The true dogwood flowers are actually tiny, yellowish green and insignificant, being compacted into button-like clusters.  However, each flower cluster is surrounded by four showy, white, petal-like bracts which open flat, giving the appearance of a single, large, 3-4” diameter, 4-petaled, white flower.  Oval, dark green leaves (3-6” long) turn attractive shades of red in fall.  Bright red fruits are bitter and inedible to humans (some authors say poisonous) but are loved by birds. Fruits mature in late summer to early fall and may persist until late in the year.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word flos flower in reference to its attractive spring flowers.Common name of dogwood is in probable reference to an old-time use of hard slender stems from this tree for making skewers once known as dags or dogs.
","
Problems
Flowering dogwood, when stressed, is susceptible to a rather large number of disease problems, the most serious of which is dogwood anthracnose.  Although this anthracnose is not yet a serious problem in Missouri, it has caused considerable devastation in parts of the eastern U.S.  Plants are also susceptible to powdery mildew, leaf spot, canker, root rot and leaf and twig blight.  Stressed trees also become vulnerable to borers.  Leaf miner and scale are less serious potential insect pests.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cornus kousa, commonly called Kousa dogwood, is a small, deciduous flowering tree or multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-30’ tall, with a vase-shaped habit in the early years but eventually maturing to a more rounded form.  Bloom occurs in late spring.  The showy parts of the Kousa dogwood “flower” (3-5” across) are the four narrowly pointed petal-like white bracts which surround the center cluster of insignificant, yellowish-green, true flowers.  Flowers are followed by berry-like fruits (to 1” diameter) which mature to a pinkish red in summer and persist into fall.  Fruits are technically edible, but are usually left for the birds.  Oval, pointed leaves (to 4” long) are dark green, but usually turns attractive shades of reddish-purple to scarlet in autumn. Mottled, exfoliating, tan and gray bark on mature trees is attractive in winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet is the Japanese name for this species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. This plant has better disease resistance and better cold hardiness than flowering dogwood, Cornus florida, and is an excellent alternative to flowering dogwood in areas where dogwood anthracnose is a problem.

Cornus racemosa, commonly called gray dogwood, is a deciduous shrub which is native to Missouri and typically occurs in moist or rocky ground along streams, ponds, wet meadows, glade and prairie margins, thickets and rocky bluffs. It grows 10-15' tall and features white flowers borne in terminal racemes (hence the species name of racemosa) in late spring and grayish-green, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves (2-4"" long). Foliage turns an interesting (but not always showy) dusky purplish red in fall. Terminal stems holding the flowers are distinctively red and provide interesting contrast to the clusters of small white berries which form after the flowers have dropped. Red stem color is more easily seen after the fruits are gone, and red color often persists into early winter.Genus name comes from the Latin word cornu meaning horn in probable reference to the strength and density of the wood.  Cornus is also the Latin name for cornelian cherry.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being produced in racemes.

Cut foliage back to the ground in late winter. Clumps may be divided in late winter to early spring. This grass is technically gynodioecious, but usually appears dioecious. Female plants produce prodigious amounts of seed and can self-seed freely, often resulting in naturalization that displaces valuable native plants. This plant is considerably invasive in certain areas of the western U. S., particularly California and Hawaii where it is not now recommended for planting. In the St. Louis area (USDA Zone 6), this grass will generally not survive winter, and should be planted in large containers (e.g., whiskey barrels) for overwintering in a greenhouse.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cortaderia selloana, commonly called pampas grass, is native to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Its common name is in obvious reference to the Argentine grasslands (the pampas) where it grows. It was planted around the world in Victorian times, and today is considered to be one of the most popular of the ornamental grasses. This is a tough, large grass that forms dense, substantial clumps (tussocks) featuring arching, serrulate, narrow green leaves that are topped in fall by huge, feathery, silvery white plumes. It was first introduced into the U. S. in 1848, and for many years now has been grown as an ornamental plant in certain southern and western parts of the U.S. It has also been grown commercially for harvest of its large flower plumes for use in dried arrangements. Leaf blades are extremely sharp (easily cut human skin) and may reach 6-8’ in length. Flower plumes (1-3’ long) may rise to 10-12’ tall on erect stems. Silvery white plumes (sometimes with traces of pink) are more impressive on female plants than on male plants.Genus name comes from the Argentinian name.

Corylus americana, commonly called American filbert or hazelnut, is a Missouri native, deciduous, rounded, multi-stemmed shrub which typically grows 8-16' tall and occurs statewide in dry or moist thickets, woodlands and wood margins, valleys, uplands and prairies. Monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same plant). In spring, male flowers appear in showy, 2-3"" long, yellowish brown catkins and female flowers appear in small, reddish, inconspicuous catkins. Female flowers give way to small, egg-shaped, 1/2"" long, edible nuts (maturing July-August) which are encased in leafy, husk-like, ragged-edged bracts. Nuts are similar in flavor to the European filbert, and may be roasted and eaten or ground into flour, but are also commonly left for the squirrels and birds. Ovate, double-toothed, dark green leaves (3-6"" long). Fall color is quite variable, ranging from attractive combinations of orange, rose, purplish red, yellow and green to undistinguished, dull yellowish green.Genus name comes from the Greek word korylos, or from korys meaning a helmet, in regard to the husk on the nut.Specific epithet means of the Americas, North or South.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Crataegus crus-galli, commonly called cockspur thorn, is sometimes seen as a dense, low-branched, broad-rounded tree to 25-35’ with horizontal branching armed with numerous large thorns (1.5-3” long).  Lower branches often sweep near to the ground.  It is also often seen as a tall, flat-topped shrub.  It is native from Quebec to North Carolina and Kansas.  In Missouri, it typically occurs in thickets and rocky pastures throughout the state (Steyermark).  Obovate to oblong-obovate dark green leaves (to 3” long) have wedge-shaped bases.  Foliage turns orange to scarlet to purple red in fall.  White flowers (in corymbs to 3”) bloom in May for a period of 7-10 days.  Flowers emit an unpleasant fragrance.  Flowers are followed by rounded fruits (3/8” diameter) that ripen to deep red in fall (September-October) and typically  persist to late fall.  Fruits are technically edible, but are usually best left for the birds.  The fruit is sometimes called a haw.Genus name comes from the Greek name for the tree. From kratos meaning strength for its strong, hard wood.Crus-galli in Latin means leg of a cock in reference to the purported resemblance of the thorns of this plant to a cock’s spurs.  The specific epithet of this plant is sometimes also designated as crusgalli.The white hawthorn blossom (Crataegus) is the Missouri State Flower.
","
Problems
Pests and diseases are a problem with most hawthorns. Plants are susceptible to cedar-hawthorn and cedar-quince rusts (rust stage where eastern red cedars are present in the area) and fireblight.  Other potential diseases include fungal leaf spots, powdery mildew, cankers, apple scab, leaf blight and twig blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, borers, caterpillars, lacebugs, leafminers and scale. Red spider mites may also occur. Use of pesticide sprays may be advisable in areas where this plant suffers from significant diseases and insects. On species plants, numerous thorns pose significant risks for young children and also make culture/pruning more difficult.
","
Garden Uses
Small flowering landscape tree for lawns or open woodland areas. Notwithstanding disease susceptibility, a well-maintained tree can be ornamentally attractive. On species plants, thorns are a drawback for pedestrian areas or areas with small children. Plants may be effective when grown as barrier plants on property borders or in hedgerows.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cucumis melo, commonly called muskmelon or sweet melon, is a scabrid or hispid, scrambling or climbing, annual or perennial plant of the gourd family.  Common name is in reference to the musky smell which emanates from many of the fruits in the species when cut open.  The fruits in this species vary considerably in terms of shape, size, rind, texture, flavor and flesh color.  This is a polymorphic taxon that produces not only edible muskmelons (straight species) but also six different edible varieties or groups (some experts prefer the term group because variety only applies to plants in the wild) as follows:  (1) var. cantalupensis (cantaloupe developed at Cantalupi near Rome), (2) var. inodorous (winter melons including casaba and honeydew), (3) var. reticulatus (netted or musk melon with netted rind and musky sweet orange flesh), (4) var. conomon (oriental pickling melon), (5) var. chito group (mango melons), (6) var. dudaim (stink melon or Queen Anne’s pocket melon), and (7) var. flexuosus (Armenian cucumber, snake or serpent melon with cucumber shape and appearance).

Var. flexuosus (aka flexuosus group), most commonly called Armenian cucumber, is a frost-tender, tendril bearing annual vine that is grown for harvest of its edible, long and slender, cucumber-like fruits consumed as a vegetable.  Vines will typically grow to 6-9’ long.  This is an heirloom plant first cultivated in the 1400s in western Asia from Armenia and Turkey south along the eastern Mediterranean to Egypt.  Although botanically a muskmelon, this fruit looks and tastes like a cucumber.  The cucumber that is most commonly grown for culinary consumption is the closely related Cucumis sativus.  

In frost-free climates, yellow flowers with 5-parted corollas bloom throughout much of the year.  Flowers give way to slender fruits with greenish-white flesh and thin corrugated pale green rinds.  Fruits are best harvested when young (e.g. about 12” long and 1” diameter), but will mature to as much as 36” long (hence the sometimes used common name of yard-long cucumber).  Fruits can be eaten without peeling.  Fruit flesh becomes drier and tougher as fruits mature.  Stems are clad with rounded, wavy margined, rough-pubescent, shallowly and irregularly lobed leaves (to 6” across).Genus name from Latin means cucumber as derived from the Greek word kykyon also meaning cucumber.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word melopepo meaning apple-shaped melon.
","
Problems
Watch for cucumber beetles which feed on the foliage and transmit diseases.  Aphids and spider mites may be troublesome.  Wilt, downy mildew, powdery mildew, anthracnose, stem blight, scab and leaf spot may occur.  Mosaic virus is a potential problem in some areas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cucumis sativus, commonly called cucumbers, are annual, tendril-bearing vines of the gourd family that are commonly grown both commercially and in home vegetable gardens throughout the world for harvest of edible fruits. Plants are originally native to southern Asia. For home gardens, select cultivars to be grown by expected growth habit, fruit type/size, flowering habit and disease resistance. Size varies from small gherkin types to long slicing varieties. Varieties are monoecious (both male and female flowers), gynoecious (female flowers) or parthenocarpic (self-fertile female flowers). Some varieties grow best as vines and others as bushy plants.Genus name from Latin means cucumber as derived from the Greek word kykyon also meaning cucumber.Specific epithet means cultivated.

This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. It is best grown in fertile, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. Seeds may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have risen to at least 65 degrees F., typically about the time of last spring frost. Distance between plants varies depending on the plant variety and growing method. In general, if row planting for bush type, place 3 seeds together 2-3' apart in rows 3-6' apart. Thin later to 1 or 2 plants per hole. Vining types need to be spaced 3-4' apart in rows 8' apart. Seed can also be started indoors about 3 weeks before the last spring frost date, with young plants set out after last frost date. Seedlings are cold sensitive. Fertilize well, as plants can be heavy producers. Fruits resting on mulch, straw or boards resist rot. Plants will continue to produce until the first frost if all fruits are picked prior to maturity. Harvest summer squash when young before flesh gets woody and seeds harden. Harvest winter squash when mature but prior to first fall frost.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Squashes can be divided into two general categories: summer squash (eaten as immature fruits before seeds harden) and winter squash (eaten only after fruit has grown to maturity). Curcubia pepo is a large and diverse species that was probably first domesticated in Mexico. It primarily consists of summer squash including crookneck (var. torticollia), straightneck (var. recticollis), scallop (var. clypeata), vegetable marrow (var. fastigata), cocozzelle (var. inoga) and zucchini (var. cylindrica), but also contains several notable winter squashes including pumpkin (var. pepo) and acorn (var. turbinata). Summer squashes mature rapidly and can be harvested in as little as 50 days, while winter squashes can take over 120 to fully ripen. These squashes primarily come in vine or bush form, are usually prickly, and usually have conspicuously-lobed leaves. All varieties need ample room.Genus name comes from the Latin name for a gourd.
","
Problems
Cucumber beetles carrying bacterial wilt, squash vine borers and squash bugs are the most common insect pests. Squash borers (caterpillars) tunnel into stems, causing that portion of the vine to wilt. Look for entry holes with droppings outside, make a vertical slit in the problem stem, and remove the caterpillar. Squash bugs can be removed by hand or by placing boards near the plants at night (bugs hide under the boards and can be destroyed the next morning). Additional potential insect pests include aphids, cutworms, pickleworm, leaf miners, white flies, squash bugs, and stink bugs. Watch for mites. Potential disease problems include bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, blossom end rot, downy mildew and powdery mildew. Watermelon and cucumber mosaic virus may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Summer squashes can be eaten raw in salads or stir-fried, batter fried, steamed, or cooked in a variety of additional ways including such things as zucchini breads. Summer squash blossoms are excellent in soups and stews, sauteed, stuffed, or dipped in batter and fried.

Culture
Easily grown in average, acidic, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.  Prefers loose, organically rich loams with consistent moisture in part shade (sun-dappled or morning sun).   Foliage will usually burn in full afternoon sun.  Tolerates full shade.  Also tolerates drought and dry shade (rhizomes hold moisture) once established.  Intolerant of alkaline soils.  Clumps spread somewhat slowly by creeping rhizomes, but will form attractive colonies over time.  Foliage is evergreen south of USDA Zone 7 but basically deciduous in the St. Louis area.  As needed, cut back any remaining old foliage in late winter prior to the emergence of the new growth.  Propagate by division in early spring or fall.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Epimedium acuminatum is noted for its attractive narrow green leaflets with acuminate tips and its large, spider-type, purple and white spring flowers.  It is a rhizomatous perennial that typically grows on wiry stems to form a clump rising to 12"" tall spreading to 18"" wide.  It is native to alpine woodlands in western and central China (Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces).  Showy, spidery, nodding, long-spurred, columbine-like, purple and white flowers (1-2"" across) bloom in compound inflorescences (10-55 flowers per inflorescence) in spring (April-May) atop flowering stems rising above the foliage to 24"" tall.  Each flower features four showy spurred purple petals and eight sepals (four petal-like ovate-elliptic white inner sepals and four much smaller light purple outer sepals which drop at the time of bloom).  Each flowering stem bears two opposite trifoliate leaves.  Leaves are basal and cauline, usually with biternate but sometimes triternate leaflets.  Leaflets (to 4-7"" long) are narrow and ovate to lanceolate with spiny marginal teeth and cordate bases.  New leaves emerge in spring with a pink-maroon cast, but mature to medium to dark green.  Leaves form attractive foliage mounds.Genus name is of unclear origin and meaning but the Greeks used epimedion for a very different plant.Specific epithet means tapering into a long narrow point.Epimediums are commonly called bishop’s hat or bishop's mitre (four-spurred flowers of some species resemble a clergyman's biretta) or barrenwort (root extract was once believed to prevent female conception).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Mosaic virus (transmitted by aphids) is the main disease problem.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cuphea hyssopifolia, commonly called Mexican heather, is native from Mexico to Guatemala. It is a rounded, densely branched 1-2’ tall tropical sub-shrub. It produces quaint, small, trumpet-shaped flowers with six spreading lavender petals and green calyx tubes. Flowers appear singly in the leaf axils along stems crowded with lance-shaped glossy green leaves (to 3/4” long). Blooms profusely summer to frost. Although heather-like in appearance, this plant is not a member of the heather family, hence the sometimes used common name of false heather. Some white- and pink-flowered cultivars are available. Flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies.Genus name comes from the Greek word kyphos meaning curved or humped in probable reference to the shape of its seed capsules.Specific epithet means leaves like hyssop.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cupressus sempervirens, commonly called Italian cypress, is an evergreen conifer that is native to southern Europe and western Asia. In its native habitat, it typically grows in a spreading, open-horizontal form (sometimes referred to as var. horizontalis) that is rarely if ever sold in commerce. Trees commonly sold in commerce as Italian cypress are of the familiar narrow-columnar or fastigiate form that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. This columnar/fastigiate form (sometime referred to as C. s. var. sempervirens, C. s. ‘Stricta’ or Stricta Group), is unknown to the wild, but was the tree originally described by Linneaus as Cupressus sempervirens and is the cypress of classical literature that has been commonly planted in Italian classic gardens since Renaissance times. This columnar/fastigiate form features scale-like dark gray-green leaves on upright branches. Foliage is aromatic when crushed. Rounded fruiting cones (to 1.5” diameter).Genus name is the Latin name for Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens.)Specific epithet means ever green.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Spider mites attack foliage in some areas.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10 (possibly including protected areas in Zone 8) where it is easily grown  outdoors in sandy, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to shade.  Perhaps best in part shade.  Appreciates a good mulch.  Superior soil drainage is needed.  Established plants tolerate some drought.  Plants also tolerate temperatures that briefly dip into the high teens but some frost damage to the foliage will occur.  Plants may not survive temperatures below 15 degrees F.  Plants sucker at the base.  Propagation is by suckers/offsets or seed.   Very slow growth, but plants live a long time.  Indoors plants should be planted in containers with a soil-based potting mix amended with sand and peat.   Site plants in filtered sun for 4-6 hours per day (as through a window curtain on an east, west or southern window).  Needs regular and consistent moisture with soil surface nearly drying  between water applications.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Notwithstanding the common name of sago palm or King Sago palm, this cycad is botanically closer to conifers than to palms.  This species in native to Kyushu (third largest Japanese island), the Ryukyu Islands and southern China.  It is a very slow-growing, symmetrical plant that produces a crown of shiny, arching, palm-like, evergreen palmate leaves atop a shaggy upright trunk.  Trunks take a long time to form (1"" diameter trunks may take years to eventually reach 12"" diameter).  Young plants typically grow to 2-3' tall over several years, but may take 50 or more years to eventually reach 10' tall.   Arching pinnate leaves (to 3-7' long depending on age) form a loose, feather-like rosette with leaflets to 7"" long.  Each leaf has a large mid-rib with very narrow, rigid, spiny-tipped, deep green leaflets.  Leaflets have revolute edges (margins rolled downward), hence the specific epithet.   Young sago palm plants produce leaves intermittently in several different growth spurts per year, however mature plants only produce leaves once per year.  Plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants).  Female plants will not produce seed without a nearby male, however these plants rarely flower when grown indoors in containers.  Males produce upright yellowish ellipsoid pollen cones (to 12-18"" tall).  Orbicular female cones produce vermilion seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek name for a kind of palm.Specific epithet means means rolled back.

Noteworthy Characteristics
C. persicum is native to the eastern Mediterranean. Species flowers are rose-pink to lavender-white or white. Florist's cyclamen are frost-tender hybrids derived from C. persicum. They feature clumps of long-stalked basal dark green leaves often variegated with silver blotching or veining. Solitary flowers with twisted and reflexed petals bloom from winter to spring atop leafless stems rising 6-9"" tall. These hybrids offer a much greater range of flower colors than the species, including violet, lavender, purple, pink, rose, red and white, often with red centers. In contrast to florist's cyclamen, the other type of cyclamen, species cyclamen, consists of a number of different species plants that typically are smaller (2-5"" tall) and usually have much better winter hardiness (USDA Zones 5 to 8). C. hederifolium, for example, may be grown in the ground year-round in St. Louis with a protected location and winter mulch.Genus name comes from the Greek word presumably from kylos meaning circle and referring to the rounded tubers.Specific epithet means Persian.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cydonia oblonga, commonly known as common quince, is a deciduous, multi-stemmed small tree or large shrub that features crooked branches clad with broad-ovate to broad-elliptic pale green leaves (to 4"" long) that are gray-hairy below.  Common quince is primarily grown today for fruit production or as a dwarfing pear rootstock.  It is native to rocky slopes and woodland margins in the Trans-Caucasus region which includes Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, southwestern Russia and Turkmenistan.  Plants have escaped garden plantings in the U. S. (particularly in the northeast), but plants are generally not considered to be invasive.  Commercial production in the U. S. is very limited (mostly in California and New York).  Common quince typically grows to 10-15' (less frequently to 20') tall.  Solitary, five-petaled, pale pink to white flowers (2 1/2"" diameter) bloom from leaf axils in late spring (May) on current season's growth.  Immature fruits (round to pear shaped quinces to 3"" diameter) are green with gray-white shading but mature in fall to bright yellow.  Fruit on cultivated varieties is usually larger.  In climates with warm winters, quinces will fully ripen on the tree/shrub and can be enjoyed fresh-picked.  However, in many areas where grown in the U. S., quince fruits are still very astringent in October when they first begin to ripen, hence they are usually cooked rather than consumed fresh.  Quinces may be used in jellies, preserves and pies.  

Cultivars include 'Champion', 'Pineapple',  'Portugal' and 'Smyrna'.Genus name is derived from the town of Cydon (now Khania) in Crete.Specific epithet means oblong.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is evergreen (roots may be hardy to Zone 8b). In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual in gardens or in containers. It is easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, but prefers full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but is best in organically rich loams with good drainage. Seed is difficult to obtain. Nurseries and seed companies generally sell starts in small pots. Fresh stalks of lemongrass (leaves and roots absent) can also be purchased from grocery stores specializing in Southeast Asian cuisine for rooting in a glass of water. Plant outside in spring after last frost date. In fall just before first frost, stalks can be harvested (cut off top leaves and save 6-"" sections of the bulbous shoot bases) and frozen for culinary use during the winter. Several leaf sections with attached roots can also be divided and potted with top leaves removed for overwintering in a bright window. These saved sections can be then used as starts for the following year. Smaller container plants can be overwintered indoors in bright light locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cymbopogon citratus, commonly called lemongrass, is a frost-tender clumping perennial grass that is popularly used as a lemony flavoring in Thai, Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian cooking and is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for that purpose. It is also an outstanding ornamental grass that lends great beauty to garden areas regardless of whether its culinary uses are to be tapped. In the St. Louis area, it typically forms a dense rounded clump of foliage to 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall and as wide in one growing season. Gracefully-arching, strap-shaped linear leaves (to 3’ long and to 1” wide) are light green. Leaves emit a lemony fragrance when bruised. It rarely produces flowers. Extracted plant oils have been used for many years in herbal medicines and perfumes.Genus name comes from the Greek words kymbe meaning a boat and pogon meaning a beard.Specific epithet means resembling Citrus for the scent.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 7-9 where this plant is best grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun.  Shelter from strong winds.  Mulch in winter near the northern parts of the growing range.  Propagation is best done from division.  Some cultivars may be grown from seed.  This is a Mediterranean-type plant that grows best in temperate climates with cool summers and  mild winters.  It thrives in some parts of California.  Commercial production for globe artichoke is generally limited to USDA Zone 7 and south.   Plants may be grown north of USDA Zone 7 as annuals (either as ornamentals and/or for harvest of artichokes).  Some plants will not produce good buds when grown from seed as annuals (develop too slowly), but some cultivars (such as 'Imperial Star' PVP) develop buds so quickly (90 days after transplants are set out) that a good crop will reliably be produced from seed by late summer.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Cynara cardunculus (Scolymus Group), commonly called globe artichoke, is an upright columnar perennial vegetable which features lobed, jagged, deeply-serrate, green leaves and thistle-like flowers.  Scolymus Group was probably developed from cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) in ancient times.  In comparison to the species, Scolymus Group plants have larger flower heads, nearly spineless leaves that are less divided, and broader involucre bracts.  The vegetable part of this plant is the large unopened flower bud which contains the edible heart.  Flower buds appear year round in warm climates, with the major crop being in April-May and a lesser crop in fall.  In cold winter climates, the major crop is in fall.  Globe artichoke typically grows in a clump to 3' tall.  Flower stalks rise from the clump to 4-5' tall, each stalk topped by a large terminal flower bud with several smaller buds below.  Flower buds are harvested prior to opening.  If buds are not harvested prior to bloom, the buds will open to spectacular violet blue thistle-like flowers with diameters to as much as 7"".  Nearly all commercial artichoke production in the U.S. occurs in the State of California with 75% of that California production occurring in Monterey County.  Castroville, known as the Artichoke Capital of the World, celebrates an annual Artichoke Festival in May of each year.Genus name comes from the Latin name.Specific epithet means resembling a small thistle.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Aphids, snails, slugs and blackfly may appear.  Watch for gray mold, powdery mildew or root rot.
","
Garden Uses
Globe artichokes may be grown as vegetables.  Buds are harvested prior to flowering.  For consumption, the bud is first steamed until the bracts are easily removable.  Bracts are then removed one at a time with the fleshy edible base on each bract being eaten.  Inedible choke is removed, leaving the heart.  Regardless of culinary value, this plant provides excellent interest to gardens for ornamental foliage and flowers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Cyperus papyrus, commonly called papyrus, is native to Africa. It is a tall, clump-forming, tender perennial sedge that, in frost-free areas, will grow up to 15’ tall. In St. Louis gardens, stems will grow shorter (to 5-8’ tall). It features a grass-like clump of triangular green stems that rise up from thick, woody rhizomes. Each stem is topped by an umbellate inflorescence of 100+ narrow arching thread-like rays (4-12” long). Greenish-brown flower clusters appear at the ends of the rays. Flowers give way to brown, nut-like fruits. In ancient Egypt, the stems of this plant (considered by some authorities to be the bulrush of the Bible) were used to make a paper-like writing material also called papyrus.Genus name comes from the Greek word kypeiros which was the name given to some local sedges.Specific epithet is the Greek name used for paper made into rolls from this plant in Ancient Egypt.A dwarf version of this plant, designated as C. p. ‘Nanus’ or C. profiler, typically grows to only 2-3’ tall.

Winter  hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it is easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Best with consistent moisture except during the dry/dormant season when watering should be reduced.   Plants dislike temperatures that dip below 50 degrees F.  Propagate by tip cuttings or seed.   Plants grown from seed typically do not flower in the first 7-10 years.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Delonix regia, commonly called flamboyant or royal poinciana, is a tropical tree that is native to Madagascar but  has been widely planted around the world in tropical and semi-tropical areas.  It typically grows to 30-40' tall with a broad-spreading, flat-topped, umbrella-like crown.  Crowns of mature trees often spread to 60-70' wide.  This tree is noted for featuring a superb ornamental display of showy scarlet flowers and compound mimosa-like leaves.  In the U. S.,  it can be grown outdoors in the far southern areas of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California plus Hawaii. This tree is deciduous in climates that have a dry season or mildly cool winter, but otherwise is evergreen.  Lacy, feathery, mimosa-like, bipinnately compound  leaves to 8-15"" long, each having 10-20 pairs of pinnae with further division into 25-35 pairs of  smaller pinnules.  Flowers (3-4"")  are a brilliant scarlet orange.  Each flower has four spreading petals and a larger fifth petal (the banner) which has streaks of yellow and white.  In the continental U. S., flowering typically occurs from late spring into summer.  Flowers give way to flattened bean-like fruit pods (each to 24"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek words delos meaning evident or conspicuous and onux meaning a claw and referring to the long-clawed petals.Specific epithet means royal.Common name of royal poinciana honors M. de Poinci, 17th century governor of the French West Indies.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Spreading crown is too large for many lots.  Vigorous root systems can lift sidewalks.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-9. This is a short-lived perennial that is perhaps best grown as a biennial. However, many gardeners simply purchase cold treated plants in spring and grow them as annuals. Moreover, many of the new cultivars will bloom the first year from seed if the seed is started early enough. Sweet William is best grown in deep, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun, but generally appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. In optimum growing conditions it will reseed each year and remain in the garden for many years as if it were a long-lived perennial. Double-flowered forms will not come true from seed, however. Prompt deadheading of spent flowers (shear back large plantings) promotes perennial tendencies. Seed may be planted directly in the garden in late spring for bloom the following year. Some nurseries sell seedlings in early fall that may be planted immediately for bloom the following year. Nurseries commonly sell plants in spring for flowering the same year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus barbatus, commonly called sweet William, typically grows 12-24” tall and features small flowers held in dense, flat-topped terminal clusters (3-5” wide). Many cultivars are available in commerce, including double-flowered forms as well as some dwarf plants (4-8” tall). Flowers come in vivid shades of red, pink, white and bicolor, sometimes with a contrasting eye, and with fringed petals that are bearded on the inside. Bloom from late spring to early summer. Flowers may be fragrant, although many of the newer cultivars have no scent. Lance-shaped medium green leaves (to 4” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means bearded or with long, weak hairs.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers fertile, alkaline, somewhat gritty loams with good drainage. Tolerates some part afternoon shade, particularly in hot summer climates. Plants tend to die out in the center if drainage is not superior. Division and/or reseeding may be necessary every 2-3 years. Prompt removal of spent flowers may prolong bloom period, but is quite labor intensive. For larger plantings, it is perhaps more practical to simply shear off spent flowers after bloom. Shearing plants after bloom but before seed sets will prevent any unwanted self-seeding, will trim the foliage and may promote a possible sparse rebloom in fall. Plants are easily grown from seed and may self-seed in optimum growing conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Dianthus deltoides, commonly called maiden pink, is an evergreen perennial that typically forms loose spreading mats of foliage to 4-6” tall and to 24” wide. Narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves. Heavily fringed, slightly fragrant, single flowers (to 3/4” diameter) appear on branched flowering stems (8-12” tall) in late spring, covering the foliage mound with brightly colored bloom. Species flowers are usually deep pink with a dark, pale spotted band at the base of the petals. Evergreen foliage remains attractive year-round, as long as soils are given consistent moisture during the growing season.Genus name comes from the Greek words dios meaning divine and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means triangular.“Pink” in the common name is in reference to the fringed petals that typically look as if they were cut with pinking shears.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dicentra eximia, commonly called fringed bleeding heart, is a native wildflower of the eastern United States that typically occurs on forest floors, rocky woods and ledges in the Appalachian Mountains. Features deeply-cut, fern-like, grayish-green, foliage which persists throughout the growing season and pink to purplish red, nodding, heart-shaped flowers carried above the foliage on long, leafless, leaning stems. Protruding inner petals of the flower appear to form a drop of blood at the bottom of each heart-shaped flower (hence the common name of bleeding heart). Plant typically grows to 15"" tall, with the flower stems and basal leaves growing directly out of the scaly rootstock. Bloom begins in late spring. In cooler climates, flowering may continue throughout the summer, but in the hotter climates, the flowering will generally stop in hot weather, with a possible rebloom occurring only when the weather cools in late summer or early fall. Similar in appearance to the showy, old garden bleeding heart from Asia, D. spectabilis, except D. spectabilis is taller and wider, its flowers are larger and its foliage is less dissected and usually goes dormant by mid-summer.Genus name comes from the Greek words dis meaning twice and kentron meaning a spur for the two-spurred flowers.Specific epithet means distinguished or out of the ordinary.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Diervilla lonicera, commonly known as bush honeysuckle, is a suckering, densely branched, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3' tall and to 4' wide.  It is native to dry rocky open woodland areas and thickets from Newfoundland to Saskatchewan south to North Carolina, Tennessee and Iowa.  It is noted for its small shrubby form, yellow trumpet-shaped flowers, dark green leaves and fall color.  Tube-like flowers (each to 1/2"" across), resembling the flowers of true honeysuckle (genus Lonicera), bloom in panicles (cymes) in late spring to early summer (June-July).  In order to taste the sweet nectar, the tubular flower must be suckled, hence the name honeysuckle.  Plants are self-sterile (seed set requires pollination from a nearby plant).  Flowers give rise to fruits (dry woody dehiscent capsules).  Ovate to oblong-lanceolate, pointed, opposite, glossy green leaves (to 2-5"" long) with fine marginal teeth turn interesting shades of yellow to orange sometimes changing to red in fall.Genus name honors a French surgeon named Dierville or Diereville who observed with great interest a North American native bush-honeysuckle growing in Canada during an extensive trip he took to that country in 1699-1700.  Upon his return to France, he introduced the shrub to European culture, with the bush-honeysuckle genus eventually being named in memory of him.  Linnaeus subsequently listed the observed Canadian plant as Diervilla lonicera.Specific epithet comes from the genus name for honeysuckle (Lonicera).This species should not to be confused with Lonicera japonica, which shares the common name bush honeysuckle and is an exotic invasive species to Missouri and the Midwest by the Midwest Invasive Plant Network.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Diospyros virginiana, commonly called persimmon, is deciduous tree with a rounded oval crown that grows to 35-60’ tall. It is native from Connecticut to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rocky or dry open woods, limestone glades, prairies, thickets, abandoned fields and along roadsides (Steyermark). It is one of the easiest trees to identify in winter because of its distinctive thick, dark gray bark that is broken into rectangular blocks. Plants are usually dioecious (separate male and female trees), but some trees have perfect flowers. Fragrant, white to greenish-yellow flowers bloom in late spring, with the male flowers appearing in clusters and the female flowers appearing solitary. Edible persimmon fruits (1-2” in diameter) mature in fall to an orange to reddish-purple color, and may persist on the tree into winter. Ovate to elliptic leaves (2-6” long) are glossy dark green above, and turn yellowish-green (infrequently reddish purple) in autumn. Persimmon fruit is quite astringent when green, but upon ripening becomes sweet and may be eaten off the tree. Fruits are commonly used in syrups, jellies, ice creams or pies. Ripe fruits are too soft for shipping/sale. Persimmon leaves can be used to make teas. Persimmon is a member of the ebony family. The wood is extremely hard and has been used to make golf club heads, billiard cues and shoe lasts.Genus name comes from the Greek dios meaning divine and pyros meaning wheat or grain for this divine fruit.Specific epithet means of Virginia.

Slender gray upright stems are topped by tufts of arching, glossy, sword-shaped leaves (to 2’ long and 1/2” wide). Leaves are deep green with narrow reddish edges. Lower leaves fall off with age leaving distinctive diamond-shaped leaf scars on the stems. In its native habitat of Madagascar, this species grows as a shrub or small tree to 20’ tall. Fragrant tiny white flowers in spring are followed by spherical yellow-orange beries. Flowers and berries rarely appear on indoor plants. This plant is also sometimes called Spanish dagger or red-stemmed dracaena or Madagascar dragon tree. ‘Tricolor’ is a popular cultivar which adds a thin yellow stripe to each leaf.Genus name comes from the Greek word drakaina meaning a female dragon.Specific epithet refers to the plants distinctive leaf margin.

Dryopteris filix-mas, commonly called male fern, is native to Europe and North America.  This is a large, arching, deciduous male fern with erect, stout rhizomes and medium green blades (fronds) that grow to 3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall.  Blade is pinnate-pinnatifid (almost 2-pinnate) with 20-30 pair of long-pointed pinnae (leaflets) per blade.  Each leaflet is divided into short, rounded, finely-serrated pinnules (sub-leaflets).  Sori (fruit dots) on the leaflets are located closer to the midvein than the margin.  Crisped, crested, forked and dwarf variants of this species exist.  In North America, this fern ranges from Newfoundland to British Columbia, from New England to the Great Lakes, and from South Dakota to Washington south to California and Texas.  It is typically found in cool, moist, rocky woods, but in New England it is uncommon and limited only to areas with calcareous soils.  In Europe, it is commonly found in a variety of locations including roadsides.Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.Specific epithet means male fern in reference to the somewhat vigorous growing habits of ferns in this species.

Dryopteris intermedia, commonly called evergreen wood fern, glandular wood fern to fancy fern, is a rhizomatous wood fern that is native to moist woodland areas, ravines, swamp margins and rocky slopes in Eastern North America from Newfoundland to Ontario to Minnesota south to Missouri and Georgia.  It is common through much of its range, but uncommon in Missouri where it is typically found on shaded ledges and sandstone bluffs.  It was formerly known as Dryopteris spinulosa var. intermedia, and is very similar in appearance to Dryopteris carthusiana (formerly known as Dryopteris spinulosa) from which it is primarily distinguished by (a) length of pinnules on lowest pair of pinnae being usually shorter than the length of the next pinnule and (b) glandular leaf blades.    

This is a lacy evergreen wood fern that typically grows to 1-3’ tall with upright arching fronds to 40” long and 8” wide.  Frond leaflets are lobed and toothed.  Oval to narrow triangular, thrice-cut, finely dissected blade has 10-15 pairs of narrow lance-shaped pinnae (leaflets).  Sori (fruit dots) appear on the leaflet undersides on fertile fronds in early to mid-summer.Genus name from Greek dryas meaning oak and pteris meaning fern in reference to the presence of some species of wood ferns in woodland areas populated with oaks.Specific epithet means intermediate in probable reference to this fern being between D. carthusiana and D. campyloptera.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Dypsis lutescens, commonly called bamboo palm, butterfly palm or areca palm, is native to moist forest areas in Madagascar.   Although endangered in its native habitat, it is commonly available in commerce throughout the world for outdoor plantings (where winter hardy) or as a houseplant.  This multi-stemmed palm is now considered to be the most popular palm sold as a houseplant.  Outdoors it will typically grow to 12-30' tall.  Multiple-ringed, cane-like, yellow stems grow from the base of the plant in clusters.  Stems sometimes resemble bamboo when suckers are removed, hence the common name of bamboo palm.  Stems are topped with pinnate, upward-curving, light green leaves (to 3-6' long) with yellow midribs.  Each leaf has 40-60 1/2 to 3/4"" lance-shaped leaflets per side.   Yellow flowers bloom in summer in panicles to 2' long.  Flowers are not particularly showy.  Flowers are followed by small yellow-orange fruits (each to 1/2"" long) that mature to nearly black.  Another common name for this palm is golden cane palm in reference to its yellow stems.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Chrysalidocarpus lutescens.Specific epithet means turning yellow in reference to the yellow flowers, stems and leaf midribs.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elaeagnus angustifolia, commonly called Russian olive or oleaster is native to Europe and Asia. It is a small, usually thorny, deciduous tree or large shrub that is typically grown for its silvery foliage, small fragrant yellow flowers, olive-like fruit and ease of cultivation. It has been widely planted in North America as both a windbreak and an ornamental. As a tree, it typically grows 12-20’ tall. It responds well to clipping and can be grown much shorter as a hedge. Branches and trunk are covered with exfoliating brown bark that is attractive in winter. Twigs are occasionally thorny. Narrow, willow-like leaves (to 2” long) are dark green above and silvery beneath. Angustifolia means narrow-leaved. Fragrant apetalous flowers with four lobed calyces appear in clusters of 1-3 in leaf axils near the base of new shoots in late spring. Flowers are silvery white outside and yellowish inside. Flowers are followed in fall by an often abundant crop of berry-like, silver-scaled fruit resembling olives, hence the common name. Fruit is edible, and is sometimes used for making preserves. Fruit is also attractive to wildlife. Although relatively tame in the St. Louis climate, Russian olive has aggressively naturalized in many parts of the West, particularly in watersheads and marshlands of the Great Plains where it has self-seeded and spread along rivers and wetland areas, crowding out native plants such as cottonwoods and willows, to the point where it is now being considered a noxious weed.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.

Wavy-margined, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3.5"" long) are lustrous green above but silvery-white and dotted with tiny brown scales below.  Small, apetalous, bell-shaped, creamy white flowers (to 1/4"" long) bloom in axillary clusters in late fall (October-November).  Flowers are not particularly showy, but are intensely fragrant (some suggest gardenia-scented).  Small, one-seeded, reddish-brown fruits (drupes to 1/2"" long) typically ripen in spring (late March-May).  Fruits are technically edible, but perhaps best left for the birds.Genus name comes from the Greek words elaia meaning the olive tree and agnos meaning chaste-tree.Specific epithet means sharp-pointed in reference to the sharp thorny spines found on this species.Common names are also in reference to the spines.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Elymus magellanicus, commonly called Magellan wheatgrass or blue wheatgrass, is a cool season perennial grass that is native to alpine areas in southern Patagonia (far southern parts of Chile and Argentina).  It is grown in landscapes today for enjoyment of its exceptional metallic blue leaves which many consider to have the best blue color of all blue-leaved grasses.  Flat, narrow, linear, pointed leaf blades grow in a dense foliage clump to 16” tall.  As they age, the older leaves arch outward revealing the central, more erect, intensely blue new growth.  Thin, stiff, upright blue flowering stems topped by wheat-like pale blue-green flower spikes rise above the leaves in late spring to early summer to 24-30” tall.  Flowers are light blue-gray, but turn tan with age.  Although the flower stems gracefully sway in the breeze, they are not particularly ornamental.  When mature, the blue flowers turn tan with the flower spikes purportedly resembling the fruit spikes of wheat, hence the common name of blue wheatgrass.Genus name comes from the Greek word elymos used for a type of grain.Specific epithet means of the region of the Straits of Magellan which is the South American water route separating southern Chile and Tierra del Fuego.‘Blue Tango’ is a cultivar that purportedly features more intense blue foliage color than that found on the species.  It is sometimes sold in commerce under the name of Agropyron magellanicum 'Blue Tango'.

Culture
Best grown in medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates an extremely wide range of soils, however. Will grow in up to 4” of standing water. Spreads to form large colonies in the wild. Homeowners are often more interested in learning how to eradicate this plant from the landscape than how to grow it. It is a very aggressive plant which, if not preemptively restrained, will spread aggressively by branched, creeping rhizomes. Once established, it can be extremely difficult to remove by digging because its rhizomes spread wide and deep, and any small section of rhizome left behind can sprout a new plant. Consider using soil barriers to restrict growth. In water gardens or tub gardens, plant in pots at water bottom to contain growth (both height and spread).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Equisetum hyemale, commonly called scouring rush or rough horsetail, is a non-flowering, rush-like, rhizomatous, evergreen perennial which typically grows 3-5’ tall and is native to large portions of Eurasia, Canada and the U.S., including Missouri. It typically occurs in wet woods, moist hillsides and peripheries of water bodies (lakes, rivers, ponds). This species features rigid, rough, hollow, vertically-ridged, jointed-and-segmented, bamboo-like, dark green stems (to 1/2” diameter at the base) which rise up from the plant rhizomes. Each stem node (joint) is effectively marked by a whorl of tiny, stem-clasping, scale-like leaves which are fused into an ash-gray sheath (1/4” long) ending in a fringe of teeth. Teeth are usually shed during the growing season. Each sheath is set off and accentuated, both above and below, by thin, stem-ringing, black bands. Photosynthesis is basically carried on by the stems of this plant. Vegetative and fertile stems are alike in this species, with some vegetative stems bearing, at the stem tips, pine cone-like fruiting heads (to 1” long) which contain numerous spores. The evergreen stems are particularly noticeable in winter and can provide significant interest to the landscape. Stems have a high silica content and were used by early Americans for polishing pots and pans, hence the common name of scouring rush. Equisetum is not a rush however. Nor is it a fern. Equisetum is the single surviving genus of a class of primitive vascular plants that dates back to the mid-Devonian period (350 + million years ago). Today, the equisetums are categorized as fern allies in large part because they, like the ferns, are non-flowering, seedless plants which reproduce by spores.Genus name comes from the Latin words equus meaning a horse and seta meaning a bristle.Specific epithet means of winter or flowering is winter. Most probably for its winter interest as Equisetum is not a flowering plant.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Eragrostis elliottii, commonly known as love grass, is native to certain open woodlands, sandy areas and prairies in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. It is a fine-textured, warm season grass that grows to 3’ tall and is noted for its blue-green foliage and fluffy white flowers. White flower panicles appear in summer, turn tan by late summer as the seed ripens and finally lighten to straw hues in autumn. Flower panicles dance in the wind, hence the cultivar name. Additional common names for this species of grass include field love grass, blue love grass and Elliott’s love grass.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet presumably honors botanist Stephen Elliott (1771-1830) from Charleston, South Carolina.‘Wind Dancer’ features narrow (1/4” wide) blue-green leaves.

Eragrostis spectabilis, commonly called purple love grass, is a warm season bunchgrass that is native to sandy soils from Maine to South Dakota south to Florida, Texas, Arizona and Mexico. In Missouri, it is found throughout the State, most commonly in sandy, rocky or open ground and along roads, fencerows and railroads (Steyermark). Flat, coarse, mostly basal, green leaves (to 10"" long and 3/8"" wide) form a somewhat disorganized clump of foliage that typically rises to 10"" tall. Soft reddish-purple flowers in a loose, open inflorescence appear in August, forming an airy cloud that covers the grass clump and raises the overall height of the plant to 24"" tall. Flowers lose color and turn brown by October. As the seeds mature, the inflorescence usually detaches from the plant and blows along the ground like a tumbleweed distributing seed as it goes.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet means spectacular or showy.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants are drought tolerant and perhaps do best in sandy loams in hot, dry locations. Plants will self-seed in optimum growing conditions. Propagate by seed or division in spring. Spreads by self-seeding and by stems rooting along the ground at the nodes.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eragrostis trichodes, commonly called sand love grass, is a warm season bunchgrass that is native from Ohio to Nebraska and south to Louisiana and Texas. It is densely tufted and typically rises to 2-4’ tall on generally weak stems. In Missouri, it is most commonly found in open sandy woods or in sandy areas along streams or railroad tracks (Steyermark). It features narrow, mostly flat, shiny dark green blades (to 6-30” long by 1/4” wide). Purple tinted flowers appear in loose, open panicles in July-August. Flower stems do not rise well above the foliage which detracts from the overall plant appearance. Mature plants turn bronze in fall and have continued interest into winter.Genus name comes from the Greek words eros meaning love and agrostis meaning grass.Specific epithet means hairy or shaggy.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Mature clumps sometimes tend to sprawl or droop.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Good drainage is important for this plant. Cut back stems after flowering to encourage additional bloom. Tolerates some light shade, particularly in hot summer climates.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Erigeron is a genus of about 200 species of annuals, biennials and perennials from dry grassland and mountainous areas of predominantly North America. Erigerons are similar in appearance to and sometimes confused with asters.Genus name comes from the Greek words eri meaning early and geron meaning old man in reference to the early bloom time and downy plant appearance suggestive of the white beard of an old man.Plants in the genus Erigeron are often commonly called fleabane as a result of a once widely held theory that these plants repel fleas.'Darkest of All' is a hybrid erigeron cultivar which probably features E. speciosus as a prominent parent. It features large flowers (to 2"" across) with deep violet rays and yellow center disks atop stiff stems rising to 2' tall from a basal clump of lance-shaped green leaves (3-6"" long). Smaller lance-shaped stem leaves. Blooms in summer with some intermittent rebloom extending into early fall. 'Darkest of All' is a translation of the original German cultivar name of 'Dunkelste Aller'.
","
Problems
Some susceptibility to powdery mildew, leaf spots and rust. Erigeron often does not thrive in hot and humid summer climates such as found in the St. Louis area.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where it is best grown in fertile, evenly moist, well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Best with consistent moisture, but established plants will tolerate some drought. Plants may survive temperatures to as low as 10-15 degrees F., but flowers and fruits will normally perish if temperatures dip below 28 degrees F. In St. Louis, plants may be grown in containers as houseplants. Containers may be taken outside in summer. Indoors, containers are best sited in sunny windows with moderate temperatures of 50-70 degrees F. Reduce watering in winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eriobotrya japonica, commonly called loquat, Japanese medlar or Japanese plum, is a small, short-trunked, upward-branching, broadleaf evergreen tree that typically grows to 10-25' tall with a round form. It also often grows as a large spreading shrub. It is generally noted for its compact size, attractive foliage, fragrant flowers and edible fruit. Loquat is native to China and perhaps Japan. Wrinkled, strongly-veined, leathery, elliptic-lanceolate leaves (to 12"" long) with toothed margins are dark green above and light green covered with rusty down beneath. Sweetly fragrant, five-petaled, white flowers in large panicles (to 6"" long) bloom in late fall-early winter. Flowers are followed by small spherical to pear-shaped fruits (to 1-2"" long), each with juicy flesh and one to several large seeds. Fruits typically ripen in spring (February in Florida and April in California). Fruits have smooth to downy, yellow to orange skin. Fruits are excellent when eaten fresh off the tree or in salads, sauces, jellies/jams or tarts/pies. Many different fruiting cultivars exist in commerce.Genus name comes from the Greek words erion meaning wool and botrys meaning a cluster of grapes for the woolly, clustered panicles.Specific epithet means of Japan.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. This rose family member is susceptible to fire blight. Potential insect pests include aphids, scale, fruit flies and caterpillars. Potential disease pests include rots, cankers, scab, leaf spot and blight. Seeds and young plant leaves are mildly poisonous if ingested. In areas where fruit set occurs, fruit drop can cause troublesome litter problems.
","
Garden Uses
In frost free areas, plants are grown commercially for fruit production or as landscape ornamentals near decks or patios. Good street tree in areas where fruit does not set. Effective houseplants in colder climates.

Culture
This annual is typically grown in home gardens for culinary use as a lettuce-like salad green.  It thrives in rich moist soils in full sun to part shade.  It is best grown during the cooler spring and fall months of the year rather than in the heat of the summer.  After last spring frost date, sow seeds in the garden a few inches apart in rows about 18” apart, with seedlings later thinned to a spacing of about 12”.  In the alternative, seeds may be started indoors in containers prior to last spring frost date for later transplanting outdoors.  Leaves must be harvested when young and tender.  Leaf flavor becomes strong and often bitter as the leaves mature.  A second crop can be planted in late summer for harvest before fall frost.  Although this annual may self-seed in the garden, it is usually recommended that seed be purchased rather than harvested from garden plants.  In St. Louis, seeds typically germinate in May with leaves harvested in early summer.  By contrast, this plant also grows as a winter annual, albeit sometimes an invasive one, in some other parts of the U.S. such as the deserts of Arizona where seeds typically germinate in the wild after fall rains for growth over winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Eruca vesicaria, commonly known as by a number of common names including arugula, garden rocket, rocket salad, roka, roquette, rucola or rugula, is a Eurasian annual herb of the mustard family.  It was first cultivated by ancient Greeks and Romans.  It continues to be widely cultivated in Europe today, but has also been introduced into many other parts of the world including much of North America where it has become not only a treasured culinary plant, but also, in some cases, an invasive garden escapee and self-seeder.  It typically naturalizes in disturbed habitats, fields and meadows.  

Plants typically grow to 10-24” tall.  Irregular, pinnately-lobed, basal leaves, each with 4 to 10 small lateral lobes and a large terminal lobe, appear in rosettes.  Uppermost stem leaves are entire and smaller.  Four-petalled flowers (to 1” long) bloom in corymbs.  Each flower has a pale yellow corolla, yellow stamens, and dark brown or purple veins.  Fruit (to 1.5” long) is a seeded, prominently-beaked pod.  

Leaves should only be harvested when young and tender.  Older leaves become bitter and lose significant culinary quality as they mature. Young leaves lack bitterness and are typically eaten raw, adding a peppery, some say nutty, mustard-like flavor to a variety of food dishes including salads, sandwiches, egg dishes, sauces, soups or stir fries. Notwithstanding its culinary virtues, this plant is also extensively cultivated in central and western Asia for its seed oil which is used as a lubricant and illuminant in pickling. 

Subsp. sativa from Latin means cultivated in probable reference to the historical designation of this subspecies as a salad plant for cultivation in home gardens.

Some authors include this subspecies in with the species and others elevate it to its own species, Eruca sativa.Genus name probably comes from the Latin eructo meaning to eruct or belch in reference to the strong, spicy, sometimes bitter taste of mature plant leavesSpecific epithet comes from the Latin word vesica meaning bladder in reference to the inflated seed pods.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Eucalyptus deglupta, commonly called Mindanao gum or rainbow eucalyptus, is a very large, fast-growing, broadleaved evergreen tree that is native to moist humid tropical forested areas with high rainfall in New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippine Islands (Island of Mindanao).  It is the only eucalyptus tree that is indigenous to the northern hemisphere.  In its native habitat, it will mature to as much as 250' tall with a trunk diameter of 6'.  Outside its native habitat, it will typically grow much shorter (to 100-125' tall).  It is perhaps best noted for its smooth orange-tinted trunk bark which peels in summer to reveal a unique and sometimes stunning multi-colored bark (as described by the common name of rainbow eucalyptus) consisting of streaks of pale green, red, orange, gray and purple-brown.  Outside tropical settings, the bark is typically much less colorful.  Acuminate, lance-shaped leaves (to 6"" long) are aromatic when crushed.  Tiny white flowers in axillary or terminal compound inflorescences (panicles of 7-flowered umbels) bloom at various times during the year depending upon location.  Trees are a source of hardwood timber.Genus name comes from the Greek words eu meaning well and kalypto meaning to cover, as with a lid and an allusion to the united calyx-lobes and petals forming a lid or cap which is shed when the flower opens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates close to full shade, but usually at the expense of diminished fall color quality. This is an adaptable shrub that tolerates a wide range of soils except for wet, poorly-drained ones. Plants appreciate consistent moisture, particularly when grown in full sun locations.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Euonymus alatus, commonly called winged euonymus, burning bush, winged burning bush or winged spindle tree, is a dense, mounded, spreading, flat-topped, multi-stemmed shrub that is particularly noted for its fiery red fall foliage color. It is native to forests, woodlands and scrub areas in eastern Russia, Japan, China and Korea. It was introduced into the U.S. around 1860 as an ornamental, and over time has become an extremely popular shrub for homes, commercial properties and along highways. This shrub will mature over time to 15-20' tall, but is often pruned shorter. Elliptic to obovate, crenulate to serrulate, green leaves (to 3” long) turn bright red in fall. Fall color can be spectacular. Small, yellowish-green flowers appear in May but are not showy. Small fruits (1/3” red capsules) ripen in fall. Fruit capsules split open when ripe to reveal the tiny seeds (each encased in a fleshy orange-red aril). Seeds are attractive to certain birds who eat and distribute them. Greenish-brown stems have distinctive corky ridges (""wings"" as used in the common name). Corky-winged stems are more noticeable in winter after leaf drop. Winged euonymus has escaped plantings and naturalized in at least 21 eastern and mid-western states. In some areas, it is now considered to be a threat to native plants because of its ability to establish itself in woodlands, forests, fields, roadsides and disturbed areas where, if conditions are favorable, it will out-compete native plants to form dense thickets.Genus name is an ancient Greek name referring to plants of this genus.Specific epithet means winged.More compact forms (4-10' tall) are also available (e.g., Euonymus alatus 'Compactus' and Euonymus alatus 'Rudy Haag').
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Twig blight may occur, particularly in wet soil conditions. Watch for spider mites.
